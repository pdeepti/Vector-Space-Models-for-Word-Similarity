now , nearly one in six members of the german soccer association is female . " come on , the strikers have to show themselves ! " shouts coach cosimo martina during soccer practice .
fortuna koeln , a traditional club in southern cologne , is among those which have recently expanded their girls ' programs . fourteen-year-old theresa garsztecki , who 's played for fortuna koeln for six years already , is one of the senior members on the team .
her friend luzie schwarz , who has been involved for just as long , started playing soccer almost by chance . " when my little brother joined a soccer team , i wanted to do it too , " said luzie . role models at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women won their last world cup title in china in 2007 luzie and theresa are n't alone in their passion for the sport .
the german soccer association currently has over one million female members .
interest skyrocketed last year , with sign-ups jumping five percent over 2007 . the recent success of the national women 's team - they 've won the last two world cups - certainly has something to do with it . " the girls sure have enough role models here at home , " said hans-juergen tritschoks , who used to coach the successful women 's team 1 .
fcc frankfurt .
" just take birgit prinz , who has been player of the year three times . " tritschoks also named top players like renate lingor and nia kuenzer .
" those were and still are accessible stars , who patiently give autographs after every game . " little attention from the media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male soccer players , like lukas podolski , get much more media attention still , the national players are seldom seen on tv and in the media . " i think women 's soccer is n't reported on enough , " said theresa .
luzie agreed : " male soccer players are in the media a lot more , often with a photo or an extra story , or something . " so it 's no surprise that the girls also look to national men 's player lukas podolski as a role model .
however , podolski and his team members simply have a physical advantage , when it comes to sprints , goal shots and head kicks , said tritschoks . " thanks to professional training , the -lrb- women 's -rrb- game has gotten a lot quicker and more athletic , " he said .
" but women just have less muscle mass and therefore less power . " keep going when it hurts nevertheless , women bring just as much technical finesse to the game , added tritschoks - and they have a one-up on their male colleagues in at least one area . " unlike the men , the women just stand right up again after they 've been fouled and keep playing . " for theresa , combining her hobby with school is a challenge .
she goes to practice twice a week , has to keep up with her homework , and has games on the weekends . " i also like to put on makeup and go out to parties , " said theresa .
" and i can still play soccer .
i think you can do both . " lutz kulling -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there appears to a number of clubs in serious danger of going bankrupt , " said rummenigge in an interview with daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" not just in england , spanish and italian clubs also have massive problems . " even big-spending chelsea , the london soccer club controlled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , has been hit by the credit crunch and will sign fewer new players this season .
ceo peter kenyon said the team was taking a prudent view and reviewing its cost base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack earned more than 15 million euros in 2008 abramovich has pumped around 689 million euros -lrb- $ 903 million -rrb- into chelsea since acquiring it in 2003 , which included the signing of germany midfielder michael ballack . rummenigge said the situations in france and germany , where there are stricter licensing rules , are better . " but nobody can predict how things are going to look tomorrow when the world is in such a financial turmoil , " said the bayern boss .
" that 's why you should keep your powder dry , or money , so you can reload if there are lucrative opportunities . " the current catchphrase is " sink costs " and most clubs used the winter transfer window to reduce the size of their squads rather than sign new players . " soccer must realize that the business can no longer reckon with growth , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- vice president peter peters , even though the effects of the economic slowdown have yet to fully hit many of the country 's top clubs . top-flight bundesliga side schalke 04 offloaded seven players and dortmund six with loan signings now the preferred method of signing up new talent . corporate ticket sales are also suffering with bayer leverkusen especially hard hit as the club is looking to sell 2,400 business seats when its bayarena stadium is completed in the summer . financial shootout in the lower leagues the situation is worse .
there has been no frantic spending spree during this season 's transfer window .
this winter only 45 new players were signed in the third division compared to a transfer record of 65 last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams hope they 'll be able to get back on their feet after the crisis " the league is turning into a financial shootout , " said dirk eichebaum , president of stuttgarter kickers . borussia dortmund ceo hans-joachim watzke expects repercussions for the bundesliga over the medium term , saying " there will be cuts and bruises . " " we were lucky to cut debts by 50 million euros at the right time , " said watzke .
" in today 's climate that would n't have been possible .
it is also important that we were able to extend contracts on a long-term basis with our big sponsors shortly before the start of the international financial crisis . " borussia moenchengladbach , karlsruhe , energie cottbus , vfl bochum and hertha berlin face an uncertain year .
they are all looking for new sponsorship deals with their partners when the contracts run out at the end of the 2009 season . schalke president josef schnusenberg said he remains confident that the bundesliga can come out of the economic slowdown in a stronger position than when it went in . " i am convinced that the bundesliga is the model of the future for european soccer because the solid financial standing of our clubs will be to our long-term advantage , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .
bad timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , right , and gloss , middle , are said to have had a poor working relationship seehofer initially rejected the offer , but questions arose over whether gloss should stay in office after publicly expressing a wish to go .
the daily der tagesspiegel noted on sunday that glos could not have picked a worse time to resign and that its execution could have hardly been any more awkward .
" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the csu lost its absolute majority in bavaria glos has headed the economy ministry since november 2005 when the cdu and csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .
last month the government announced a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65-billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

playmobil turned 35 this week , but its creator , hans beck , died just short of the occasion . thirty-five years have passed since the first playmobil toys sparked children 's imaginations and their still on the job .
many adults , too , remember their first playmobil figures fondly , which , when they first hit the market , were only available in green , blue , red or yellow .
the accessories were limited , but distinctive , allowing a child to turn a american indian into a policeman in the blink of an eye .
the 7.5-centimeter -lrb- three-inch -rrb- men were created out of necessity .
the oil crisis of the 1970s spelled financial doom for the toy manufacturer geobra brandstaetter when the cost of producing large pieces of plastic became too much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil creator hans beck died just days before the 35th anniversary company owner horst brandstaetter asked his research director hans beck to come up with a toy figures for children .
on jan .
30 , 2009 , hans beck died at the age of 79 and was unable to see his creation turn 35 . industry doubtful , but children excited in 1974 , there was 19 different articles in the playmobil line : construction worker , american indian , and knight figurines and all the accessories to create three different imaginary worlds .
the figures were an instant success , mostly due to the fact that children were able to act out the world their parents and other adults lived in with figures that could actually grab on to things or bend their legs to sit in a car .
no one , however , expected such long-term success , but today , 35 years later , over 2.2 billion figures have been produced .
fan letters from kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction workers were among the original figures created in the 1970s children have sent in countless letters over the years asking if the company could make their playmobil figures .
this past summer , for example , most of the letters asked for school playsets .
however , there are clear limits to the kinds of things the company will produce , explains playmobil managing director andrea schauer .
there is no such thing as a playmobil soldier or an iraq war play set , but the battle between good and evil can be acted out through chivalrous knights or police officers .
playmobil figures are so famous they 've even managed to make it onto the stage and television .
in stuttgart schiller 's opera " the robbers " was acted out using playmobil and television host harald schmidt uses the figures to act out different scenarios on his late night talk show . helga spannhake -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .
last year at the berlinale , craggy-faced iranian star reza naji received the best actor award for his portrayal of a harassed father in director majid majidi 's " the song of sparrows .

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .
27 . glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had offered to resign on saturday , but he was immediately turned down by his party boss , horst seehofer . in a letter to seehofer , 64-year-old glos cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of this year 's national polls . merkel has not officially commented on the matter , but steinmeier indicated the minister 's action was related to internal quarrels within the csu , the most junior of the three parties that form the ruling coalition in berlin . the csu " is taking part in a steeplechase .
i 've no idea what the outcome will be , " steinmeier told national public broadcaster ard .
the foreign minister is the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in the upcoming federal elections . despite having his resignation turned down , reuters news agency quoted anonymous sources saying they did not expect him to stay in his position too much longer .
the online edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung also reported on sunday that glos would be replaced soon . instability in the conservative christian parties leadership has given steinmeier an opportunity to criticize merkel 's handling of the economic crisis . in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine to be published on monday , steinmeier said merkel and her allies were " incapable of finding the right way to face the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis . " " it is only thanks to the spd that ms. merkel , as chancellor , has been able to make the right decisions , " said steinmeier , who currently acts as vice-chancellor .
he had previously been more cautious in criticizing merkel so as not to upset the uneasy coalition . bad timing for a resignation the daily tagesspiegel on sunday noted that glos picked a particularly awkward time to submit his resignation as germany is struggling to come to terms with a harsh recession that has seen growth fall , unemployment rise and credit dry up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's criticism of merkel indicates national elections are looming " michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic crisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of this ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " opined the paper . as economics minister , glos was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
that was most apparent last month when the government announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . glos has headed the economics ministry since november 2005 when merkel 's christian democrats and the csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats .
he joined the csu since 1970 and was elected to parliament in 1976 .
before moving to his cabinet job , he was leader of the csu parliamentary group in berlin . greens : let glos leave formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government . opposition greens party 's parliamentary leader renate kuenast said the government should let the minister go . " it is damaging for germany to hold on to an economics minister who has called ' get me out of here , " ' she said in a reference to the popular reality television series " i 'm a celebrity get me out of here .

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

playmobil turned 35 this week , but its creator , hans beck , died just short of the occasion . thirty-five years have passed since the first playmobil toys sparked children 's imaginations and their still on the job .
many adults , too , remember their first playmobil figures fondly , which , when they first hit the market , were only available in green , blue , red or yellow .
the accessories were limited , but distinctive , allowing a child to turn a american indian into a policeman in the blink of an eye .
the 7.5-centimeter -lrb- three-inch -rrb- men were created out of necessity .
the oil crisis of the 1970s spelled financial doom for the toy manufacturer geobra brandstaetter when the cost of producing large pieces of plastic became too much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil creator hans beck died just days before the 35th anniversary company owner horst brandstaetter asked his research director hans beck to come up with a toy figures for children .
on jan .
30 , 2009 , hans beck died at the age of 79 and was unable to see his creation turn 35 . industry doubtful , but children excited in 1974 , there was 19 different articles in the playmobil line : construction worker , american indian , and knight figurines and all the accessories to create three different imaginary worlds .
the figures were an instant success , mostly due to the fact that children were able to act out the world their parents and other adults lived in with figures that could actually grab on to things or bend their legs to sit in a car .
no one , however , expected such long-term success , but today , 35 years later , over 2.2 billion figures have been produced .
fan letters from kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction workers were among the original figures created in the 1970s children have sent in countless letters over the years asking if the company could make their playmobil figures .
this past summer , for example , most of the letters asked for school playsets .
however , there are clear limits to the kinds of things the company will produce , explains playmobil managing director andrea schauer .
there is no such thing as a playmobil soldier or an iraq war play set , but the battle between good and evil can be acted out through chivalrous knights or police officers .
playmobil figures are so famous they 've even managed to make it onto the stage and television .
in stuttgart schiller 's opera " the robbers " was acted out using playmobil and television host harald schmidt uses the figures to act out different scenarios on his late night talk show . helga spannhake -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .

" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .

the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .
bad timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , right , and gloss , middle , are said to have had a poor working relationship seehofer initially rejected the offer , but questions arose over whether gloss should stay in office after publicly expressing a wish to go .
the daily der tagesspiegel noted on sunday that glos could not have picked a worse time to resign and that its execution could have hardly been any more awkward .
" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the csu lost its absolute majority in bavaria glos has headed the economy ministry since november 2005 when the cdu and csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .
last month the government announced a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65-billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .
bad timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , right , and gloss , middle , are said to have had a poor working relationship seehofer initially rejected the offer , but questions arose over whether gloss should stay in office after publicly expressing a wish to go .

" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .

seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .
bad timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , right , and gloss , middle , are said to have had a poor working relationship seehofer initially rejected the offer , but questions arose over whether gloss should stay in office after publicly expressing a wish to go .
the daily der tagesspiegel noted on sunday that glos could not have picked a worse time to resign and that its execution could have hardly been any more awkward .
" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the csu lost its absolute majority in bavaria glos has headed the economy ministry since november 2005 when the cdu and csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .
last month the government announced a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65-billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .

" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .
while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution also grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .
while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution also grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .
while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution also grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
some activists are campaigning for legislation allowing the introduction of " living wills " whereby people can state what type of medical treatment they wish to receive . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote comes in the midst of the global economic crisis , which has hit switzerland , though not nearly as hard as other european nations .
unemployment has risen , but is still very low in comparison to most other countries , and stands at just over 3 percent .
the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- forced the referendum after objecting to the extension of free movement to the two additional countries , claiming it would lead to job losses for swiss workers , higher taxes and to a rise in crime .
controversial imagery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing svp takes a hardline stance on immigration the svp , infamous for using controversial imagery to project their ideas , produced posters depicting three aggressive looking black crows pecking away at a map of switzerland .

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .

" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .

the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .

8 , energie cottbus defeated hanover 3-1 thanks to a pair of goals from dimitar rangelov and a third from stanislav angelov to move out of the relegation zone . pressure was on bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich had control of much of the match 's first half but fell behind early in the game bayern , under pressure after being beaten 1-0 at hamburg last week in the resumption of the bundesliga after its winter break , were buoyed by saturday 's results in which none of their rivals in the top five could win . but juergen klinsmann 's side found themselves behind in the second minute against visiting dortmund when central defender martin demichelis slipped to allow nelson valdez a free run on goal that he finished by curling shot past munich keeper michael rensing . " we had to do more after conceding the early goal and we created enough chances , " klinsmann said .
" the team put a lot into the game and the win was more than deserved . " it was one-way traffic for the first 45 minutes as bayern piled on the pressure and keeper roman weidenfeller twice did well to save from klose .
but the keeper was at fault in the 24th minute when he weakly parried a soft shot from franck ribery into the path of ze roberto who made no mistake from close range . klinsi counts on klose late in game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni , right , left the match to make room for us player landon donovan juergen klopp 's dortmund side looked more comfortable after the break , and rensing was tested by substitute nuri sahin before florian klinge missed a glorious opportunity when he headed wide in the 62nd minute . klinsmann had replaced bastian schweinsteiger with hamit altintop and brought on us striker landon donovan for an unhappy luca toni in a double substitution with 18 minutes remaining . the decision to keep klose on rather than toni paid off when dortmund defender felipe santana headed a long ball from mark van bommel into the germany striker 's path and this time he made sure by putting the ball through weidenfeller 's legs . with dortmund 's resistance broken , klose struck again with 90 minutes gone when ribery again danced down the left and put the ball across the goalmouth for the striker to do the rest . " a game lasts 90 minutes and you just have to forget things , " klose said of the missed chances before scoring .
" i always believe i will take my chance and know that the next opportunity will come along .
i scored two goals but the important thing today was to win . " dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .
27 . glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had offered to resign on saturday , but he was immediately turned down by his party boss , horst seehofer . in a letter to seehofer , 64-year-old glos cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of this year 's national polls . merkel has not officially commented on the matter , but steinmeier indicated the minister 's action was related to internal quarrels within the csu , the most junior of the three parties that form the ruling coalition in berlin . the csu " is taking part in a steeplechase .
i 've no idea what the outcome will be , " steinmeier told national public broadcaster ard .
the foreign minister is the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in the upcoming federal elections . despite having his resignation turned down , reuters news agency quoted anonymous sources saying they did not expect him to stay in his position too much longer .
the online edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung also reported on sunday that glos would be replaced soon . instability in the conservative christian parties leadership has given steinmeier an opportunity to criticize merkel 's handling of the economic crisis . in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine to be published on monday , steinmeier said merkel and her allies were " incapable of finding the right way to face the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis . " " it is only thanks to the spd that ms. merkel , as chancellor , has been able to make the right decisions , " said steinmeier , who currently acts as vice-chancellor .

that was most apparent last month when the government announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . glos has headed the economics ministry since november 2005 when merkel 's christian democrats and the csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats .
he joined the csu since 1970 and was elected to parliament in 1976 .
before moving to his cabinet job , he was leader of the csu parliamentary group in berlin . greens : let glos leave formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government . opposition greens party 's parliamentary leader renate kuenast said the government should let the minister go .

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants .

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .
a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to spread broadband internet connections to the countryside barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , said on friday that the commission had been aware of the council 's legal opinion for some time .
" and we do n't agree with it , " laitenberger said .
" this is primarily a political , not a juridical issue .
the european commission will continue to endeavor to find a solution , " he said .
the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .
" we have listened to the comments made by the member states ... and we are strongly persuaded that the outcome of the discussions will be fruitful , " officials from the czech presidency of the eu said on friday .

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .
a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to spread broadband internet connections to the countryside barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , said on friday that the commission had been aware of the council 's legal opinion for some time .
" and we do n't agree with it , " laitenberger said .
" this is primarily a political , not a juridical issue .
the european commission will continue to endeavor to find a solution , " he said .
the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .
" we have listened to the comments made by the member states ... and we are strongly persuaded that the outcome of the discussions will be fruitful , " officials from the czech presidency of the eu said on friday .
eu governments agreed in principle to use the 5 billions euros from the eu 's budget 's reserves at a summit in december , but a final decision is not expected before the spring council in march .
" the question now is who will pay , " diplomats said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there appears to a number of clubs in serious danger of going bankrupt , " said rummenigge in an interview with daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" not just in england , spanish and italian clubs also have massive problems . " even big-spending chelsea , the london soccer club controlled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , has been hit by the credit crunch and will sign fewer new players this season .
ceo peter kenyon said the team was taking a prudent view and reviewing its cost base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack earned more than 15 million euros in 2008 abramovich has pumped around 689 million euros -lrb- $ 903 million -rrb- into chelsea since acquiring it in 2003 , which included the signing of germany midfielder michael ballack . rummenigge said the situations in france and germany , where there are stricter licensing rules , are better . " but nobody can predict how things are going to look tomorrow when the world is in such a financial turmoil , " said the bayern boss .
" that 's why you should keep your powder dry , or money , so you can reload if there are lucrative opportunities . " the current catchphrase is " sink costs " and most clubs used the winter transfer window to reduce the size of their squads rather than sign new players . " soccer must realize that the business can no longer reckon with growth , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- vice president peter peters , even though the effects of the economic slowdown have yet to fully hit many of the country 's top clubs . top-flight bundesliga side schalke 04 offloaded seven players and dortmund six with loan signings now the preferred method of signing up new talent . corporate ticket sales are also suffering with bayer leverkusen especially hard hit as the club is looking to sell 2,400 business seats when its bayarena stadium is completed in the summer . financial shootout in the lower leagues the situation is worse .
there has been no frantic spending spree during this season 's transfer window .
this winter only 45 new players were signed in the third division compared to a transfer record of 65 last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams hope they 'll be able to get back on their feet after the crisis " the league is turning into a financial shootout , " said dirk eichebaum , president of stuttgarter kickers . borussia dortmund ceo hans-joachim watzke expects repercussions for the bundesliga over the medium term , saying " there will be cuts and bruises . " " we were lucky to cut debts by 50 million euros at the right time , " said watzke .
" in today 's climate that would n't have been possible .
it is also important that we were able to extend contracts on a long-term basis with our big sponsors shortly before the start of the international financial crisis . " borussia moenchengladbach , karlsruhe , energie cottbus , vfl bochum and hertha berlin face an uncertain year .
they are all looking for new sponsorship deals with their partners when the contracts run out at the end of the 2009 season . schalke president josef schnusenberg said he remains confident that the bundesliga can come out of the economic slowdown in a stronger position than when it went in . " i am convinced that the bundesliga is the model of the future for european soccer because the solid financial standing of our clubs will be to our long-term advantage , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .
a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to spread broadband internet connections to the countryside barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , said on friday that the commission had been aware of the council 's legal opinion for some time .
" and we do n't agree with it , " laitenberger said .
" this is primarily a political , not a juridical issue .
the european commission will continue to endeavor to find a solution , " he said .
the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .
" we have listened to the comments made by the member states ... and we are strongly persuaded that the outcome of the discussions will be fruitful , " officials from the czech presidency of the eu said on friday .
eu governments agreed in principle to use the 5 billions euros from the eu 's budget 's reserves at a summit in december , but a final decision is not expected before the spring council in march .

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .
27 . glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had offered to resign on saturday , but he was immediately turned down by his party boss , horst seehofer . in a letter to seehofer , 64-year-old glos cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of this year 's national polls . merkel has not officially commented on the matter , but steinmeier indicated the minister 's action was related to internal quarrels within the csu , the most junior of the three parties that form the ruling coalition in berlin . the csu " is taking part in a steeplechase .
i 've no idea what the outcome will be , " steinmeier told national public broadcaster ard .
the foreign minister is the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in the upcoming federal elections . despite having his resignation turned down , reuters news agency quoted anonymous sources saying they did not expect him to stay in his position too much longer .
the online edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung also reported on sunday that glos would be replaced soon . instability in the conservative christian parties leadership has given steinmeier an opportunity to criticize merkel 's handling of the economic crisis . in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine to be published on monday , steinmeier said merkel and her allies were " incapable of finding the right way to face the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis . " " it is only thanks to the spd that ms. merkel , as chancellor , has been able to make the right decisions , " said steinmeier , who currently acts as vice-chancellor .
he had previously been more cautious in criticizing merkel so as not to upset the uneasy coalition . bad timing for a resignation the daily tagesspiegel on sunday noted that glos picked a particularly awkward time to submit his resignation as germany is struggling to come to terms with a harsh recession that has seen growth fall , unemployment rise and credit dry up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's criticism of merkel indicates national elections are looming " michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic crisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of this ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " opined the paper . as economics minister , glos was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
that was most apparent last month when the government announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . glos has headed the economics ministry since november 2005 when merkel 's christian democrats and the csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats .
he joined the csu since 1970 and was elected to parliament in 1976 .
before moving to his cabinet job , he was leader of the csu parliamentary group in berlin . greens : let glos leave formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government . opposition greens party 's parliamentary leader renate kuenast said the government should let the minister go . " it is damaging for germany to hold on to an economics minister who has called ' get me out of here , " ' she said in a reference to the popular reality television series " i 'm a celebrity get me out of here .

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence .

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .
last year at the berlinale , craggy-faced iranian star reza naji received the best actor award for his portrayal of a harassed father in director majid majidi 's " the song of sparrows .

the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- says eu plans to limit science-based fishing limits , protect endangered species and a strong finning ban for some of europe 's most vulnerable and neglected animals , lacks teeth . most people do not associate sharks with europe - " jaws " was filmed near cape cod , massachusetts , not in portugal .
but sustained demand for fins from asia , and a growing appetite for shark meat back home are placing many european cousins of the great white on the path of extinction .
as joe borg , the european union 's fisheries commissioner , put it : " many people associate sharks with going to the cinema , more than with beaches or restaurants .
but the latest information we have confirms that human beings are now a far bigger threat to sharks than sharks ever were to us . "
on thursday , the european union 's executive in brussels launched a series of proposals designed to help rebuild depleted shark stocks in european waters .
these involve reducing catches , increasing scientific research and stepping up controls .
eu fleets fish about 100,000 tonnes of shark each year , about an eighth of the world 's total catches .
europe providing fins for asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a third of all shark fins exported to hong kong come from europe shark fin is considered a delicacy in asia and can retail for anything between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 per kilogram in china .
a third of all the fins exported to hong kong , the world 's biggest importer , come from europe , according to the shark alliance - an international coalition of about 60 conservationist organizations .
most of the european fins which arrive in asia are fished by spanish , french , british , italian and portuguese fleets .
meanwhile , more and more europeans find themselves eating shark meat , whether knowingly or not .
it is used to prepare " schillerlocken " in germany and portuguese " caldeirada " stew , but it can also be found in british fish-and-chip shops .
within eu waters , most fishing takes place in the north sea and the atlantic ocean .
but there is also considerable activity in the mediterranean sea .
limits on the amounts of catches are already in place , and " finning " - the practice of removing the fins and discarding the rest of the shark at sea - is illegal in the eu .
but slack controls mean that of the about 180 species found in europe , a third are now threatened with extinction , according to the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- . dpa news agency -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police . " america will do more .
the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well , " us vice-president joe biden told the conference on saturday . that call is likely to cause anxiety in europe , where the afghan campaign is far from popular with voters , and where some governments are reluctant to commit soldiers to the hottest combat areas , despite fierce pressure from allies such as britain and canada . it will be a particularly sensitive issue in germany , which faces federal elections in september .
nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .

the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .

but sustained demand for fins from asia , and a growing appetite for shark meat back home are placing many european cousins of the great white on the path of extinction .
as joe borg , the european union 's fisheries commissioner , put it : " many people associate sharks with going to the cinema , more than with beaches or restaurants .
but the latest information we have confirms that human beings are now a far bigger threat to sharks than sharks ever were to us . "
on thursday , the european union 's executive in brussels launched a series of proposals designed to help rebuild depleted shark stocks in european waters .
these involve reducing catches , increasing scientific research and stepping up controls .
eu fleets fish about 100,000 tonnes of shark each year , about an eighth of the world 's total catches .

a third of all the fins exported to hong kong , the world 's biggest importer , come from europe , according to the shark alliance - an international coalition of about 60 conservationist organizations .
most of the european fins which arrive in asia are fished by spanish , french , british , italian and portuguese fleets .
meanwhile , more and more europeans find themselves eating shark meat , whether knowingly or not .
it is used to prepare " schillerlocken " in germany and portuguese " caldeirada " stew , but it can also be found in british fish-and-chip shops .
within eu waters , most fishing takes place in the north sea and the atlantic ocean .
but there is also considerable activity in the mediterranean sea .
limits on the amounts of catches are already in place , and " finning " - the practice of removing the fins and discarding the rest of the shark at sea - is illegal in the eu .
but slack controls mean that of the about 180 species found in europe , a third are now threatened with extinction , according to the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- . dpa news agency -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fortuna koeln , a traditional club in southern cologne , is among those which have recently expanded their girls ' programs . fourteen-year-old theresa garsztecki , who 's played for fortuna koeln for six years already , is one of the senior members on the team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.02.2009 right-to-die case sparks italian constitutional row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euthanasia is illegal in italy in a race against time , italy 's government is expected to table in parliament early next week a controversial bill to re-connect a life-support system to a comatose woman at the canter of a right-to-death debate . the senate , parliament 's upper-house , is scheduled to begin debating the bill next tuesday , senate speaker , renato schifani said on saturday .
by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .
while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution also grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
some activists are campaigning for legislation allowing the introduction of " living wills " whereby people can state what type of medical treatment they wish to receive . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police . " america will do more .
the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well , " us vice-president joe biden told the conference on saturday . that call is likely to cause anxiety in europe , where the afghan campaign is far from popular with voters , and where some governments are reluctant to commit soldiers to the hottest combat areas , despite fierce pressure from allies such as britain and canada . it will be a particularly sensitive issue in germany , which faces federal elections in september .
nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 08.02.2009 swiss to decide on free movement of labor with eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss will decide whether they want to keep their borders open the swiss will head to the polls on sunday to vote in a referendum on free movement and access for eu citizens to their labor market , and will have to decide whether to open up their borders to romania and bulgaria . the latest polls indicated that the government-backed motion will likely pass and voters will extend the existing deal with 25 european states and allow in the two new eu members , but only by a slim margin .
the vote comes in the midst of the global economic crisis , which has hit switzerland , though not nearly as hard as other european nations .
unemployment has risen , but is still very low in comparison to most other countries , and stands at just over 3 percent .
the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- forced the referendum after objecting to the extension of free movement to the two additional countries , claiming it would lead to job losses for swiss workers , higher taxes and to a rise in crime .
controversial imagery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing svp takes a hardline stance on immigration the svp , infamous for using controversial imagery to project their ideas , produced posters depicting three aggressive looking black crows pecking away at a map of switzerland .
a previous campaign showed three white sheep kicking a black one out of the country .
if the right wing campaign does succeed , the implications would extend far beyond switzerland 's relationship with the two former communist countries .
the free movement agreement with the eu is linked to six other treaties , including ones on trade and transport , meaning swiss exporters would find it more difficult to get their goods into european markets .
european labor swiss businesses , some heavily reliant on european labor , would also find themselves in a panic , as they would no longer be able to keep the employees with ease and limited restrictions like they have in recent years .
some have said they might have to move their operations outside of the alpine country .
that would likely not bode well for the economy , particularly in times of economic crisis .
moreover , eu observers have speculated that brussels would suspend the schengen agreement with switzerland , which it only just joined , if voters chose to keep out the two newest members . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police . " america will do more .
the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well , " us vice-president joe biden told the conference on saturday . that call is likely to cause anxiety in europe , where the afghan campaign is far from popular with voters , and where some governments are reluctant to commit soldiers to the hottest combat areas , despite fierce pressure from allies such as britain and canada . it will be a particularly sensitive issue in germany , which faces federal elections in september .
nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 08.02.2009 german girls prove soccer is n't just for boys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit prinz is one of germany 's top female players germany 's national women 's soccer team has claimed the last two world cup titles , which has piqued girls ' interest in the sport .
now , nearly one in six members of the german soccer association is female . " come on , the strikers have to show themselves ! " shouts coach cosimo martina during soccer practice .
fortuna koeln , a traditional club in southern cologne , is among those which have recently expanded their girls ' programs . fourteen-year-old theresa garsztecki , who 's played for fortuna koeln for six years already , is one of the senior members on the team .
her friend luzie schwarz , who has been involved for just as long , started playing soccer almost by chance . " when my little brother joined a soccer team , i wanted to do it too , " said luzie . role models at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women won their last world cup title in china in 2007 luzie and theresa are n't alone in their passion for the sport .
the german soccer association currently has over one million female members .
interest skyrocketed last year , with sign-ups jumping five percent over 2007 . the recent success of the national women 's team - they 've won the last two world cups - certainly has something to do with it . " the girls sure have enough role models here at home , " said hans-juergen tritschoks , who used to coach the successful women 's team 1 .
fcc frankfurt .
" just take birgit prinz , who has been player of the year three times . " tritschoks also named top players like renate lingor and nia kuenzer .
" those were and still are accessible stars , who patiently give autographs after every game . " little attention from the media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male soccer players , like lukas podolski , get much more media attention still , the national players are seldom seen on tv and in the media . " i think women 's soccer is n't reported on enough , " said theresa .
luzie agreed : " male soccer players are in the media a lot more , often with a photo or an extra story , or something . " so it 's no surprise that the girls also look to national men 's player lukas podolski as a role model .
however , podolski and his team members simply have a physical advantage , when it comes to sprints , goal shots and head kicks , said tritschoks . " thanks to professional training , the -lrb- women 's -rrb- game has gotten a lot quicker and more athletic , " he said .
" but women just have less muscle mass and therefore less power . " keep going when it hurts nevertheless , women bring just as much technical finesse to the game , added tritschoks - and they have a one-up on their male colleagues in at least one area . " unlike the men , the women just stand right up again after they 've been fouled and keep playing . " for theresa , combining her hobby with school is a challenge .

playmobil turned 35 this week , but its creator , hans beck , died just short of the occasion . thirty-five years have passed since the first playmobil toys sparked children 's imaginations and their still on the job .
many adults , too , remember their first playmobil figures fondly , which , when they first hit the market , were only available in green , blue , red or yellow .
the accessories were limited , but distinctive , allowing a child to turn a american indian into a policeman in the blink of an eye .
the 7.5-centimeter -lrb- three-inch -rrb- men were created out of necessity .
the oil crisis of the 1970s spelled financial doom for the toy manufacturer geobra brandstaetter when the cost of producing large pieces of plastic became too much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil creator hans beck died just days before the 35th anniversary company owner horst brandstaetter asked his research director hans beck to come up with a toy figures for children .
on jan .
30 , 2009 , hans beck died at the age of 79 and was unable to see his creation turn 35 . industry doubtful , but children excited in 1974 , there was 19 different articles in the playmobil line : construction worker , american indian , and knight figurines and all the accessories to create three different imaginary worlds .
the figures were an instant success , mostly due to the fact that children were able to act out the world their parents and other adults lived in with figures that could actually grab on to things or bend their legs to sit in a car .
no one , however , expected such long-term success , but today , 35 years later , over 2.2 billion figures have been produced .
fan letters from kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction workers were among the original figures created in the 1970s children have sent in countless letters over the years asking if the company could make their playmobil figures .
this past summer , for example , most of the letters asked for school playsets .
however , there are clear limits to the kinds of things the company will produce , explains playmobil managing director andrea schauer .
there is no such thing as a playmobil soldier or an iraq war play set , but the battle between good and evil can be acted out through chivalrous knights or police officers .
playmobil figures are so famous they 've even managed to make it onto the stage and television .
in stuttgart schiller 's opera " the robbers " was acted out using playmobil and television host harald schmidt uses the figures to act out different scenarios on his late night talk show . helga spannhake -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .
a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to spread broadband internet connections to the countryside barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , said on friday that the commission had been aware of the council 's legal opinion for some time .
" and we do n't agree with it , " laitenberger said .
" this is primarily a political , not a juridical issue .
the european commission will continue to endeavor to find a solution , " he said .
the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .
" we have listened to the comments made by the member states ... and we are strongly persuaded that the outcome of the discussions will be fruitful , " officials from the czech presidency of the eu said on friday .
eu governments agreed in principle to use the 5 billions euros from the eu 's budget 's reserves at a summit in december , but a final decision is not expected before the spring council in march .
" the question now is who will pay , " diplomats said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote comes in the midst of the global economic crisis , which has hit switzerland , though not nearly as hard as other european nations .
unemployment has risen , but is still very low in comparison to most other countries , and stands at just over 3 percent .
the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- forced the referendum after objecting to the extension of free movement to the two additional countries , claiming it would lead to job losses for swiss workers , higher taxes and to a rise in crime .
controversial imagery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing svp takes a hardline stance on immigration the svp , infamous for using controversial imagery to project their ideas , produced posters depicting three aggressive looking black crows pecking away at a map of switzerland .
a previous campaign showed three white sheep kicking a black one out of the country .
if the right wing campaign does succeed , the implications would extend far beyond switzerland 's relationship with the two former communist countries .
the free movement agreement with the eu is linked to six other treaties , including ones on trade and transport , meaning swiss exporters would find it more difficult to get their goods into european markets .
european labor swiss businesses , some heavily reliant on european labor , would also find themselves in a panic , as they would no longer be able to keep the employees with ease and limited restrictions like they have in recent years .
some have said they might have to move their operations outside of the alpine country .
that would likely not bode well for the economy , particularly in times of economic crisis .
moreover , eu observers have speculated that brussels would suspend the schengen agreement with switzerland , which it only just joined , if voters chose to keep out the two newest members . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .

napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .

the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- says eu plans to limit science-based fishing limits , protect endangered species and a strong finning ban for some of europe 's most vulnerable and neglected animals , lacks teeth . most people do not associate sharks with europe - " jaws " was filmed near cape cod , massachusetts , not in portugal .
but sustained demand for fins from asia , and a growing appetite for shark meat back home are placing many european cousins of the great white on the path of extinction .
as joe borg , the european union 's fisheries commissioner , put it : " many people associate sharks with going to the cinema , more than with beaches or restaurants .
but the latest information we have confirms that human beings are now a far bigger threat to sharks than sharks ever were to us . "
on thursday , the european union 's executive in brussels launched a series of proposals designed to help rebuild depleted shark stocks in european waters .
these involve reducing catches , increasing scientific research and stepping up controls .
eu fleets fish about 100,000 tonnes of shark each year , about an eighth of the world 's total catches .
europe providing fins for asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a third of all shark fins exported to hong kong come from europe shark fin is considered a delicacy in asia and can retail for anything between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 per kilogram in china .
a third of all the fins exported to hong kong , the world 's biggest importer , come from europe , according to the shark alliance - an international coalition of about 60 conservationist organizations .
most of the european fins which arrive in asia are fished by spanish , french , british , italian and portuguese fleets .
meanwhile , more and more europeans find themselves eating shark meat , whether knowingly or not .
it is used to prepare " schillerlocken " in germany and portuguese " caldeirada " stew , but it can also be found in british fish-and-chip shops .
within eu waters , most fishing takes place in the north sea and the atlantic ocean .
but there is also considerable activity in the mediterranean sea .
limits on the amounts of catches are already in place , and " finning " - the practice of removing the fins and discarding the rest of the shark at sea - is illegal in the eu .
but slack controls mean that of the about 180 species found in europe , a third are now threatened with extinction , according to the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- . dpa news agency -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .

napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .
while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution also grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .

napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .
27 . glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had offered to resign on saturday , but he was immediately turned down by his party boss , horst seehofer . in a letter to seehofer , 64-year-old glos cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of this year 's national polls . merkel has not officially commented on the matter , but steinmeier indicated the minister 's action was related to internal quarrels within the csu , the most junior of the three parties that form the ruling coalition in berlin . the csu " is taking part in a steeplechase .
i 've no idea what the outcome will be , " steinmeier told national public broadcaster ard .
the foreign minister is the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in the upcoming federal elections . despite having his resignation turned down , reuters news agency quoted anonymous sources saying they did not expect him to stay in his position too much longer .
the online edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung also reported on sunday that glos would be replaced soon . instability in the conservative christian parties leadership has given steinmeier an opportunity to criticize merkel 's handling of the economic crisis . in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine to be published on monday , steinmeier said merkel and her allies were " incapable of finding the right way to face the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis . " " it is only thanks to the spd that ms. merkel , as chancellor , has been able to make the right decisions , " said steinmeier , who currently acts as vice-chancellor .
he had previously been more cautious in criticizing merkel so as not to upset the uneasy coalition . bad timing for a resignation the daily tagesspiegel on sunday noted that glos picked a particularly awkward time to submit his resignation as germany is struggling to come to terms with a harsh recession that has seen growth fall , unemployment rise and credit dry up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's criticism of merkel indicates national elections are looming " michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic crisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of this ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " opined the paper . as economics minister , glos was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
that was most apparent last month when the government announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . glos has headed the economics ministry since november 2005 when merkel 's christian democrats and the csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats .
he joined the csu since 1970 and was elected to parliament in 1976 .
before moving to his cabinet job , he was leader of the csu parliamentary group in berlin . greens : let glos leave formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government . opposition greens party 's parliamentary leader renate kuenast said the government should let the minister go . " it is damaging for germany to hold on to an economics minister who has called ' get me out of here , " ' she said in a reference to the popular reality television series " i 'm a celebrity get me out of here .

nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces .

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .

nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .

it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .

it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .

when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .
last year at the berlinale , craggy-faced iranian star reza naji received the best actor award for his portrayal of a harassed father in director majid majidi 's " the song of sparrows .

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .
a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to spread broadband internet connections to the countryside barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , said on friday that the commission had been aware of the council 's legal opinion for some time .
" and we do n't agree with it , " laitenberger said .
" this is primarily a political , not a juridical issue .
the european commission will continue to endeavor to find a solution , " he said .
the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .
" we have listened to the comments made by the member states ... and we are strongly persuaded that the outcome of the discussions will be fruitful , " officials from the czech presidency of the eu said on friday .
eu governments agreed in principle to use the 5 billions euros from the eu 's budget 's reserves at a summit in december , but a final decision is not expected before the spring council in march .

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .

but sustained demand for fins from asia , and a growing appetite for shark meat back home are placing many european cousins of the great white on the path of extinction .
as joe borg , the european union 's fisheries commissioner , put it : " many people associate sharks with going to the cinema , more than with beaches or restaurants .
but the latest information we have confirms that human beings are now a far bigger threat to sharks than sharks ever were to us . "
on thursday , the european union 's executive in brussels launched a series of proposals designed to help rebuild depleted shark stocks in european waters .
these involve reducing catches , increasing scientific research and stepping up controls .

most of the european fins which arrive in asia are fished by spanish , french , british , italian and portuguese fleets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.02.2009 german economics minister glos confirms resignation plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos does n't want to do his job anymore germany 's economics minister michael glos publicly announced he would quit his job following a weekend of confusion about his future and frenzied speculation about his successor . the 64-year-old glos said he would formally ask chacellor angela merkel to relieve him of his duty on monday .
" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .
bad timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , right , and gloss , middle , are said to have had a poor working relationship seehofer initially rejected the offer , but questions arose over whether gloss should stay in office after publicly expressing a wish to go .
the daily der tagesspiegel noted on sunday that glos could not have picked a worse time to resign and that its execution could have hardly been any more awkward .
" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the csu lost its absolute majority in bavaria glos has headed the economy ministry since november 2005 when the cdu and csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .
last month the government announced a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65-billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de minister 's resignation attempt a bad sign for merkel 's government german chancellor angela merkel was reported sunday to have turned down an offer from economics minister michael glos to resign .
but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer .
-lrb- 08.02.2009 -rrb- german economics minister glos offers resignation in a surprise move , german economics minister michael glos offered to resign saturday , less than eight months before the country votes in a general election , but the offer was promptly turned down by his party boss .

seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .
bad timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , right , and gloss , middle , are said to have had a poor working relationship seehofer initially rejected the offer , but questions arose over whether gloss should stay in office after publicly expressing a wish to go .
the daily der tagesspiegel noted on sunday that glos could not have picked a worse time to resign and that its execution could have hardly been any more awkward .
" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the csu lost its absolute majority in bavaria glos has headed the economy ministry since november 2005 when the cdu and csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .
last month the government announced a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65-billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- says eu plans to limit science-based fishing limits , protect endangered species and a strong finning ban for some of europe 's most vulnerable and neglected animals , lacks teeth . most people do not associate sharks with europe - " jaws " was filmed near cape cod , massachusetts , not in portugal .
but sustained demand for fins from asia , and a growing appetite for shark meat back home are placing many european cousins of the great white on the path of extinction .
as joe borg , the european union 's fisheries commissioner , put it : " many people associate sharks with going to the cinema , more than with beaches or restaurants .
but the latest information we have confirms that human beings are now a far bigger threat to sharks than sharks ever were to us . "
on thursday , the european union 's executive in brussels launched a series of proposals designed to help rebuild depleted shark stocks in european waters .
these involve reducing catches , increasing scientific research and stepping up controls .
eu fleets fish about 100,000 tonnes of shark each year , about an eighth of the world 's total catches .
europe providing fins for asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a third of all shark fins exported to hong kong come from europe shark fin is considered a delicacy in asia and can retail for anything between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 per kilogram in china .
a third of all the fins exported to hong kong , the world 's biggest importer , come from europe , according to the shark alliance - an international coalition of about 60 conservationist organizations .
most of the european fins which arrive in asia are fished by spanish , french , british , italian and portuguese fleets .
meanwhile , more and more europeans find themselves eating shark meat , whether knowingly or not .
it is used to prepare " schillerlocken " in germany and portuguese " caldeirada " stew , but it can also be found in british fish-and-chip shops .
within eu waters , most fishing takes place in the north sea and the atlantic ocean .
but there is also considerable activity in the mediterranean sea .
limits on the amounts of catches are already in place , and " finning " - the practice of removing the fins and discarding the rest of the shark at sea - is illegal in the eu .
but slack controls mean that of the about 180 species found in europe , a third are now threatened with extinction , according to the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- . dpa news agency -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote .

the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , nearly one in six members of the german soccer association is female . " come on , the strikers have to show themselves ! " shouts coach cosimo martina during soccer practice .
fortuna koeln , a traditional club in southern cologne , is among those which have recently expanded their girls ' programs . fourteen-year-old theresa garsztecki , who 's played for fortuna koeln for six years already , is one of the senior members on the team .

the german soccer association currently has over one million female members .

luzie agreed : " male soccer players are in the media a lot more , often with a photo or an extra story , or something . " so it 's no surprise that the girls also look to national men 's player lukas podolski as a role model .
however , podolski and his team members simply have a physical advantage , when it comes to sprints , goal shots and head kicks , said tritschoks . " thanks to professional training , the -lrb- women 's -rrb- game has gotten a lot quicker and more athletic , " he said .

" unlike the men , the women just stand right up again after they 've been fouled and keep playing . " for theresa , combining her hobby with school is a challenge .
she goes to practice twice a week , has to keep up with her homework , and has games on the weekends . " i also like to put on makeup and go out to parties , " said theresa .

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest .

the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world .

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .
27 . glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had offered to resign on saturday , but he was immediately turned down by his party boss , horst seehofer . in a letter to seehofer , 64-year-old glos cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of this year 's national polls . merkel has not officially commented on the matter , but steinmeier indicated the minister 's action was related to internal quarrels within the csu , the most junior of the three parties that form the ruling coalition in berlin . the csu " is taking part in a steeplechase .
i 've no idea what the outcome will be , " steinmeier told national public broadcaster ard .
the foreign minister is the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in the upcoming federal elections . despite having his resignation turned down , reuters news agency quoted anonymous sources saying they did not expect him to stay in his position too much longer .
the online edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung also reported on sunday that glos would be replaced soon . instability in the conservative christian parties leadership has given steinmeier an opportunity to criticize merkel 's handling of the economic crisis . in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine to be published on monday , steinmeier said merkel and her allies were " incapable of finding the right way to face the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis . " " it is only thanks to the spd that ms. merkel , as chancellor , has been able to make the right decisions , " said steinmeier , who currently acts as vice-chancellor .
he had previously been more cautious in criticizing merkel so as not to upset the uneasy coalition . bad timing for a resignation the daily tagesspiegel on sunday noted that glos picked a particularly awkward time to submit his resignation as germany is struggling to come to terms with a harsh recession that has seen growth fall , unemployment rise and credit dry up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's criticism of merkel indicates national elections are looming " michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic crisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of this ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " opined the paper . as economics minister , glos was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
that was most apparent last month when the government announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . glos has headed the economics ministry since november 2005 when merkel 's christian democrats and the csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats .
he joined the csu since 1970 and was elected to parliament in 1976 .
before moving to his cabinet job , he was leader of the csu parliamentary group in berlin . greens : let glos leave formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government . opposition greens party 's parliamentary leader renate kuenast said the government should let the minister go .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.02.2009 right-to-die case sparks italian constitutional row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euthanasia is illegal in italy in a race against time , italy 's government is expected to table in parliament early next week a controversial bill to re-connect a life-support system to a comatose woman at the canter of a right-to-death debate . the senate , parliament 's upper-house , is scheduled to begin debating the bill next tuesday , senate speaker , renato schifani said on saturday .
by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .

but sustained demand for fins from asia , and a growing appetite for shark meat back home are placing many european cousins of the great white on the path of extinction .
as joe borg , the european union 's fisheries commissioner , put it : " many people associate sharks with going to the cinema , more than with beaches or restaurants .
but the latest information we have confirms that human beings are now a far bigger threat to sharks than sharks ever were to us . "
on thursday , the european union 's executive in brussels launched a series of proposals designed to help rebuild depleted shark stocks in european waters .
these involve reducing catches , increasing scientific research and stepping up controls .
eu fleets fish about 100,000 tonnes of shark each year , about an eighth of the world 's total catches .

a third of all the fins exported to hong kong , the world 's biggest importer , come from europe , according to the shark alliance - an international coalition of about 60 conservationist organizations .
most of the european fins which arrive in asia are fished by spanish , french , british , italian and portuguese fleets .
meanwhile , more and more europeans find themselves eating shark meat , whether knowingly or not .
it is used to prepare " schillerlocken " in germany and portuguese " caldeirada " stew , but it can also be found in british fish-and-chip shops .
within eu waters , most fishing takes place in the north sea and the atlantic ocean .
but there is also considerable activity in the mediterranean sea .
limits on the amounts of catches are already in place , and " finning " - the practice of removing the fins and discarding the rest of the shark at sea - is illegal in the eu .
but slack controls mean that of the about 180 species found in europe , a third are now threatened with extinction , according to the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- . dpa news agency -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .
bad timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , right , and gloss , middle , are said to have had a poor working relationship seehofer initially rejected the offer , but questions arose over whether gloss should stay in office after publicly expressing a wish to go .
the daily der tagesspiegel noted on sunday that glos could not have picked a worse time to resign and that its execution could have hardly been any more awkward .
" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the csu lost its absolute majority in bavaria glos has headed the economy ministry since november 2005 when the cdu and csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .
last month the government announced a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65-billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .

" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .

seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .

the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 .

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .
27 . glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had offered to resign on saturday , but he was immediately turned down by his party boss , horst seehofer . in a letter to seehofer , 64-year-old glos cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of this year 's national polls . merkel has not officially commented on the matter , but steinmeier indicated the minister 's action was related to internal quarrels within the csu , the most junior of the three parties that form the ruling coalition in berlin . the csu " is taking part in a steeplechase .
i 've no idea what the outcome will be , " steinmeier told national public broadcaster ard .
the foreign minister is the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in the upcoming federal elections . despite having his resignation turned down , reuters news agency quoted anonymous sources saying they did not expect him to stay in his position too much longer .
the online edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung also reported on sunday that glos would be replaced soon . instability in the conservative christian parties leadership has given steinmeier an opportunity to criticize merkel 's handling of the economic crisis . in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine to be published on monday , steinmeier said merkel and her allies were " incapable of finding the right way to face the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis . " " it is only thanks to the spd that ms. merkel , as chancellor , has been able to make the right decisions , " said steinmeier , who currently acts as vice-chancellor .
he had previously been more cautious in criticizing merkel so as not to upset the uneasy coalition . bad timing for a resignation the daily tagesspiegel on sunday noted that glos picked a particularly awkward time to submit his resignation as germany is struggling to come to terms with a harsh recession that has seen growth fall , unemployment rise and credit dry up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's criticism of merkel indicates national elections are looming " michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic crisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of this ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " opined the paper . as economics minister , glos was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
that was most apparent last month when the government announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . glos has headed the economics ministry since november 2005 when merkel 's christian democrats and the csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats .
he joined the csu since 1970 and was elected to parliament in 1976 .

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police . " america will do more .
the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well , " us vice-president joe biden told the conference on saturday . that call is likely to cause anxiety in europe , where the afghan campaign is far from popular with voters , and where some governments are reluctant to commit soldiers to the hottest combat areas , despite fierce pressure from allies such as britain and canada . it will be a particularly sensitive issue in germany , which faces federal elections in september .
nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .
a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to spread broadband internet connections to the countryside barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , said on friday that the commission had been aware of the council 's legal opinion for some time .
" and we do n't agree with it , " laitenberger said .
" this is primarily a political , not a juridical issue .
the european commission will continue to endeavor to find a solution , " he said .
the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .
" we have listened to the comments made by the member states ... and we are strongly persuaded that the outcome of the discussions will be fruitful , " officials from the czech presidency of the eu said on friday .
eu governments agreed in principle to use the 5 billions euros from the eu 's budget 's reserves at a summit in december , but a final decision is not expected before the spring council in march .

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .

" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .

" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .
last year at the berlinale , craggy-faced iranian star reza naji received the best actor award for his portrayal of a harassed father in director majid majidi 's " the song of sparrows .

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .

napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .

playmobil turned 35 this week , but its creator , hans beck , died just short of the occasion . thirty-five years have passed since the first playmobil toys sparked children 's imaginations and their still on the job .
many adults , too , remember their first playmobil figures fondly , which , when they first hit the market , were only available in green , blue , red or yellow .
the accessories were limited , but distinctive , allowing a child to turn a american indian into a policeman in the blink of an eye .
the 7.5-centimeter -lrb- three-inch -rrb- men were created out of necessity .
the oil crisis of the 1970s spelled financial doom for the toy manufacturer geobra brandstaetter when the cost of producing large pieces of plastic became too much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil creator hans beck died just days before the 35th anniversary company owner horst brandstaetter asked his research director hans beck to come up with a toy figures for children .
on jan .
30 , 2009 , hans beck died at the age of 79 and was unable to see his creation turn 35 . industry doubtful , but children excited in 1974 , there was 19 different articles in the playmobil line : construction worker , american indian , and knight figurines and all the accessories to create three different imaginary worlds .
the figures were an instant success , mostly due to the fact that children were able to act out the world their parents and other adults lived in with figures that could actually grab on to things or bend their legs to sit in a car .
no one , however , expected such long-term success , but today , 35 years later , over 2.2 billion figures have been produced .
fan letters from kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction workers were among the original figures created in the 1970s children have sent in countless letters over the years asking if the company could make their playmobil figures .
this past summer , for example , most of the letters asked for school playsets .
however , there are clear limits to the kinds of things the company will produce , explains playmobil managing director andrea schauer .
there is no such thing as a playmobil soldier or an iraq war play set , but the battle between good and evil can be acted out through chivalrous knights or police officers .
playmobil figures are so famous they 've even managed to make it onto the stage and television .
in stuttgart schiller 's opera " the robbers " was acted out using playmobil and television host harald schmidt uses the figures to act out different scenarios on his late night talk show . helga spannhake -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .
last year at the berlinale , craggy-faced iranian star reza naji received the best actor award for his portrayal of a harassed father in director majid majidi 's " the song of sparrows .

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .
while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution also grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
some activists are campaigning for legislation allowing the introduction of " living wills " whereby people can state what type of medical treatment they wish to receive . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luzie agreed : " male soccer players are in the media a lot more , often with a photo or an extra story , or something . " so it 's no surprise that the girls also look to national men 's player lukas podolski as a role model .

the vote comes in the midst of the global economic crisis , which has hit switzerland , though not nearly as hard as other european nations .
unemployment has risen , but is still very low in comparison to most other countries , and stands at just over 3 percent .
the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- forced the referendum after objecting to the extension of free movement to the two additional countries , claiming it would lead to job losses for swiss workers , higher taxes and to a rise in crime .
controversial imagery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing svp takes a hardline stance on immigration the svp , infamous for using controversial imagery to project their ideas , produced posters depicting three aggressive looking black crows pecking away at a map of switzerland .
a previous campaign showed three white sheep kicking a black one out of the country .
if the right wing campaign does succeed , the implications would extend far beyond switzerland 's relationship with the two former communist countries .
the free movement agreement with the eu is linked to six other treaties , including ones on trade and transport , meaning swiss exporters would find it more difficult to get their goods into european markets .
european labor swiss businesses , some heavily reliant on european labor , would also find themselves in a panic , as they would no longer be able to keep the employees with ease and limited restrictions like they have in recent years .
some have said they might have to move their operations outside of the alpine country .
that would likely not bode well for the economy , particularly in times of economic crisis .
moreover , eu observers have speculated that brussels would suspend the schengen agreement with switzerland , which it only just joined , if voters chose to keep out the two newest members . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .
27 . glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had offered to resign on saturday , but he was immediately turned down by his party boss , horst seehofer . in a letter to seehofer , 64-year-old glos cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of this year 's national polls . merkel has not officially commented on the matter , but steinmeier indicated the minister 's action was related to internal quarrels within the csu , the most junior of the three parties that form the ruling coalition in berlin . the csu " is taking part in a steeplechase .
i 've no idea what the outcome will be , " steinmeier told national public broadcaster ard .
the foreign minister is the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in the upcoming federal elections . despite having his resignation turned down , reuters news agency quoted anonymous sources saying they did not expect him to stay in his position too much longer .
the online edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung also reported on sunday that glos would be replaced soon . instability in the conservative christian parties leadership has given steinmeier an opportunity to criticize merkel 's handling of the economic crisis . in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine to be published on monday , steinmeier said merkel and her allies were " incapable of finding the right way to face the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis . " " it is only thanks to the spd that ms. merkel , as chancellor , has been able to make the right decisions , " said steinmeier , who currently acts as vice-chancellor .

that was most apparent last month when the government announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . glos has headed the economics ministry since november 2005 when merkel 's christian democrats and the csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats .

" there appears to a number of clubs in serious danger of going bankrupt , " said rummenigge in an interview with daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" not just in england , spanish and italian clubs also have massive problems . " even big-spending chelsea , the london soccer club controlled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , has been hit by the credit crunch and will sign fewer new players this season .
ceo peter kenyon said the team was taking a prudent view and reviewing its cost base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack earned more than 15 million euros in 2008 abramovich has pumped around 689 million euros -lrb- $ 903 million -rrb- into chelsea since acquiring it in 2003 , which included the signing of germany midfielder michael ballack . rummenigge said the situations in france and germany , where there are stricter licensing rules , are better . " but nobody can predict how things are going to look tomorrow when the world is in such a financial turmoil , " said the bayern boss .
" that 's why you should keep your powder dry , or money , so you can reload if there are lucrative opportunities . " the current catchphrase is " sink costs " and most clubs used the winter transfer window to reduce the size of their squads rather than sign new players . " soccer must realize that the business can no longer reckon with growth , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- vice president peter peters , even though the effects of the economic slowdown have yet to fully hit many of the country 's top clubs . top-flight bundesliga side schalke 04 offloaded seven players and dortmund six with loan signings now the preferred method of signing up new talent . corporate ticket sales are also suffering with bayer leverkusen especially hard hit as the club is looking to sell 2,400 business seats when its bayarena stadium is completed in the summer . financial shootout in the lower leagues the situation is worse .
there has been no frantic spending spree during this season 's transfer window .
this winter only 45 new players were signed in the third division compared to a transfer record of 65 last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams hope they 'll be able to get back on their feet after the crisis " the league is turning into a financial shootout , " said dirk eichebaum , president of stuttgarter kickers . borussia dortmund ceo hans-joachim watzke expects repercussions for the bundesliga over the medium term , saying " there will be cuts and bruises . " " we were lucky to cut debts by 50 million euros at the right time , " said watzke .
" in today 's climate that would n't have been possible .
it is also important that we were able to extend contracts on a long-term basis with our big sponsors shortly before the start of the international financial crisis . " borussia moenchengladbach , karlsruhe , energie cottbus , vfl bochum and hertha berlin face an uncertain year .
they are all looking for new sponsorship deals with their partners when the contracts run out at the end of the 2009 season . schalke president josef schnusenberg said he remains confident that the bundesliga can come out of the economic slowdown in a stronger position than when it went in . " i am convinced that the bundesliga is the model of the future for european soccer because the solid financial standing of our clubs will be to our long-term advantage , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .
last year at the berlinale , craggy-faced iranian star reza naji received the best actor award for his portrayal of a harassed father in director majid majidi 's " the song of sparrows .

luzie agreed : " male soccer players are in the media a lot more , often with a photo or an extra story , or something . " so it 's no surprise that the girls also look to national men 's player lukas podolski as a role model .

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .
bad timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , right , and gloss , middle , are said to have had a poor working relationship seehofer initially rejected the offer , but questions arose over whether gloss should stay in office after publicly expressing a wish to go .
the daily der tagesspiegel noted on sunday that glos could not have picked a worse time to resign and that its execution could have hardly been any more awkward .
" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the csu lost its absolute majority in bavaria glos has headed the economy ministry since november 2005 when the cdu and csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .
last month the government announced a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65-billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police . " america will do more .
the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well , " us vice-president joe biden told the conference on saturday . that call is likely to cause anxiety in europe , where the afghan campaign is far from popular with voters , and where some governments are reluctant to commit soldiers to the hottest combat areas , despite fierce pressure from allies such as britain and canada . it will be a particularly sensitive issue in germany , which faces federal elections in september .
nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .
while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution also grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .
a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to spread broadband internet connections to the countryside barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , said on friday that the commission had been aware of the council 's legal opinion for some time .
" and we do n't agree with it , " laitenberger said .
" this is primarily a political , not a juridical issue .
the european commission will continue to endeavor to find a solution , " he said .
the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .
" we have listened to the comments made by the member states ... and we are strongly persuaded that the outcome of the discussions will be fruitful , " officials from the czech presidency of the eu said on friday .
eu governments agreed in principle to use the 5 billions euros from the eu 's budget 's reserves at a summit in december , but a final decision is not expected before the spring council in march .

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police . " america will do more .
the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well , " us vice-president joe biden told the conference on saturday . that call is likely to cause anxiety in europe , where the afghan campaign is far from popular with voters , and where some governments are reluctant to commit soldiers to the hottest combat areas , despite fierce pressure from allies such as britain and canada . it will be a particularly sensitive issue in germany , which faces federal elections in september .
nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .
27 . glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had offered to resign on saturday , but he was immediately turned down by his party boss , horst seehofer . in a letter to seehofer , 64-year-old glos cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of this year 's national polls . merkel has not officially commented on the matter , but steinmeier indicated the minister 's action was related to internal quarrels within the csu , the most junior of the three parties that form the ruling coalition in berlin . the csu " is taking part in a steeplechase .
i 've no idea what the outcome will be , " steinmeier told national public broadcaster ard .
the foreign minister is the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in the upcoming federal elections . despite having his resignation turned down , reuters news agency quoted anonymous sources saying they did not expect him to stay in his position too much longer .
the online edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung also reported on sunday that glos would be replaced soon . instability in the conservative christian parties leadership has given steinmeier an opportunity to criticize merkel 's handling of the economic crisis . in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine to be published on monday , steinmeier said merkel and her allies were " incapable of finding the right way to face the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis . " " it is only thanks to the spd that ms. merkel , as chancellor , has been able to make the right decisions , " said steinmeier , who currently acts as vice-chancellor .
he had previously been more cautious in criticizing merkel so as not to upset the uneasy coalition . bad timing for a resignation the daily tagesspiegel on sunday noted that glos picked a particularly awkward time to submit his resignation as germany is struggling to come to terms with a harsh recession that has seen growth fall , unemployment rise and credit dry up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's criticism of merkel indicates national elections are looming " michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic crisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of this ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " opined the paper . as economics minister , glos was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
that was most apparent last month when the government announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . glos has headed the economics ministry since november 2005 when merkel 's christian democrats and the csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats .
he joined the csu since 1970 and was elected to parliament in 1976 .
before moving to his cabinet job , he was leader of the csu parliamentary group in berlin . greens : let glos leave formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government . opposition greens party 's parliamentary leader renate kuenast said the government should let the minister go . " it is damaging for germany to hold on to an economics minister who has called ' get me out of here , " ' she said in a reference to the popular reality television series " i 'm a celebrity get me out of here .

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .

nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .
a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to spread broadband internet connections to the countryside barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , said on friday that the commission had been aware of the council 's legal opinion for some time .
" and we do n't agree with it , " laitenberger said .
" this is primarily a political , not a juridical issue .
the european commission will continue to endeavor to find a solution , " he said .
the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .
" we have listened to the comments made by the member states ... and we are strongly persuaded that the outcome of the discussions will be fruitful , " officials from the czech presidency of the eu said on friday .
eu governments agreed in principle to use the 5 billions euros from the eu 's budget 's reserves at a summit in december , but a final decision is not expected before the spring council in march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 08.02.2009 right-to-die case sparks italian constitutional row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euthanasia is illegal in italy in a race against time , italy 's government is expected to table in parliament early next week a controversial bill to re-connect a life-support system to a comatose woman at the canter of a right-to-death debate . the senate , parliament 's upper-house , is scheduled to begin debating the bill next tuesday , senate speaker , renato schifani said on saturday .
by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .
while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution also grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
some activists are campaigning for legislation allowing the introduction of " living wills " whereby people can state what type of medical treatment they wish to receive . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , energie cottbus defeated hanover 3-1 thanks to a pair of goals from dimitar rangelov and a third from stanislav angelov to move out of the relegation zone . pressure was on bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich had control of much of the match 's first half but fell behind early in the game bayern , under pressure after being beaten 1-0 at hamburg last week in the resumption of the bundesliga after its winter break , were buoyed by saturday 's results in which none of their rivals in the top five could win . but juergen klinsmann 's side found themselves behind in the second minute against visiting dortmund when central defender martin demichelis slipped to allow nelson valdez a free run on goal that he finished by curling shot past munich keeper michael rensing . " we had to do more after conceding the early goal and we created enough chances , " klinsmann said .
" the team put a lot into the game and the win was more than deserved . " it was one-way traffic for the first 45 minutes as bayern piled on the pressure and keeper roman weidenfeller twice did well to save from klose .
but the keeper was at fault in the 24th minute when he weakly parried a soft shot from franck ribery into the path of ze roberto who made no mistake from close range . klinsi counts on klose late in game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toni , right , left the match to make room for us player landon donovan juergen klopp 's dortmund side looked more comfortable after the break , and rensing was tested by substitute nuri sahin before florian klinge missed a glorious opportunity when he headed wide in the 62nd minute . klinsmann had replaced bastian schweinsteiger with hamit altintop and brought on us striker landon donovan for an unhappy luca toni in a double substitution with 18 minutes remaining . the decision to keep klose on rather than toni paid off when dortmund defender felipe santana headed a long ball from mark van bommel into the germany striker 's path and this time he made sure by putting the ball through weidenfeller 's legs . with dortmund 's resistance broken , klose struck again with 90 minutes gone when ribery again danced down the left and put the ball across the goalmouth for the striker to do the rest . " a game lasts 90 minutes and you just have to forget things , " klose said of the missed chances before scoring .

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 08.02.2009 swiss to decide on free movement of labor with eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss will decide whether they want to keep their borders open the swiss will head to the polls on sunday to vote in a referendum on free movement and access for eu citizens to their labor market , and will have to decide whether to open up their borders to romania and bulgaria . the latest polls indicated that the government-backed motion will likely pass and voters will extend the existing deal with 25 european states and allow in the two new eu members , but only by a slim margin .
the vote comes in the midst of the global economic crisis , which has hit switzerland , though not nearly as hard as other european nations .
unemployment has risen , but is still very low in comparison to most other countries , and stands at just over 3 percent .
the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- forced the referendum after objecting to the extension of free movement to the two additional countries , claiming it would lead to job losses for swiss workers , higher taxes and to a rise in crime .
controversial imagery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing svp takes a hardline stance on immigration the svp , infamous for using controversial imagery to project their ideas , produced posters depicting three aggressive looking black crows pecking away at a map of switzerland .
a previous campaign showed three white sheep kicking a black one out of the country .
if the right wing campaign does succeed , the implications would extend far beyond switzerland 's relationship with the two former communist countries .
the free movement agreement with the eu is linked to six other treaties , including ones on trade and transport , meaning swiss exporters would find it more difficult to get their goods into european markets .
european labor swiss businesses , some heavily reliant on european labor , would also find themselves in a panic , as they would no longer be able to keep the employees with ease and limited restrictions like they have in recent years .
some have said they might have to move their operations outside of the alpine country .
that would likely not bode well for the economy , particularly in times of economic crisis .
moreover , eu observers have speculated that brussels would suspend the schengen agreement with switzerland , which it only just joined , if voters chose to keep out the two newest members . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .
while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution also grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
some activists are campaigning for legislation allowing the introduction of " living wills " whereby people can state what type of medical treatment they wish to receive . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .
while voluntarily terminating a life is forbidden , italy 's constitution also grants patients the right to refuse medical treatment .
some activists are campaigning for legislation allowing the introduction of " living wills " whereby people can state what type of medical treatment they wish to receive . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .
a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to spread broadband internet connections to the countryside barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , said on friday that the commission had been aware of the council 's legal opinion for some time .
" and we do n't agree with it , " laitenberger said .
" this is primarily a political , not a juridical issue .
the european commission will continue to endeavor to find a solution , " he said .
the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .
" we have listened to the comments made by the member states ... and we are strongly persuaded that the outcome of the discussions will be fruitful , " officials from the czech presidency of the eu said on friday .
eu governments agreed in principle to use the 5 billions euros from the eu 's budget 's reserves at a summit in december , but a final decision is not expected before the spring council in march .
" the question now is who will pay , " diplomats said . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .
last year at the berlinale , craggy-faced iranian star reza naji received the best actor award for his portrayal of a harassed father in director majid majidi 's " the song of sparrows .

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , nearly one in six members of the german soccer association is female . " come on , the strikers have to show themselves ! " shouts coach cosimo martina during soccer practice .
fortuna koeln , a traditional club in southern cologne , is among those which have recently expanded their girls ' programs . fourteen-year-old theresa garsztecki , who 's played for fortuna koeln for six years already , is one of the senior members on the team .
her friend luzie schwarz , who has been involved for just as long , started playing soccer almost by chance . " when my little brother joined a soccer team , i wanted to do it too , " said luzie . role models at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women won their last world cup title in china in 2007 luzie and theresa are n't alone in their passion for the sport .
the german soccer association currently has over one million female members .
interest skyrocketed last year , with sign-ups jumping five percent over 2007 . the recent success of the national women 's team - they 've won the last two world cups - certainly has something to do with it . " the girls sure have enough role models here at home , " said hans-juergen tritschoks , who used to coach the successful women 's team 1 .

" little attention from the media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male soccer players , like lukas podolski , get much more media attention still , the national players are seldom seen on tv and in the media . " i think women 's soccer is n't reported on enough , " said theresa .
luzie agreed : " male soccer players are in the media a lot more , often with a photo or an extra story , or something . " so it 's no surprise that the girls also look to national men 's player lukas podolski as a role model .
however , podolski and his team members simply have a physical advantage , when it comes to sprints , goal shots and head kicks , said tritschoks . " thanks to professional training , the -lrb- women 's -rrb- game has gotten a lot quicker and more athletic , " he said .
" but women just have less muscle mass and therefore less power . " keep going when it hurts nevertheless , women bring just as much technical finesse to the game , added tritschoks - and they have a one-up on their male colleagues in at least one area . " unlike the men , the women just stand right up again after they 've been fouled and keep playing . " for theresa , combining her hobby with school is a challenge .
she goes to practice twice a week , has to keep up with her homework , and has games on the weekends . " i also like to put on makeup and go out to parties , " said theresa .

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote .

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- says eu plans to limit science-based fishing limits , protect endangered species and a strong finning ban for some of europe 's most vulnerable and neglected animals , lacks teeth . most people do not associate sharks with europe - " jaws " was filmed near cape cod , massachusetts , not in portugal .
but sustained demand for fins from asia , and a growing appetite for shark meat back home are placing many european cousins of the great white on the path of extinction .
as joe borg , the european union 's fisheries commissioner , put it : " many people associate sharks with going to the cinema , more than with beaches or restaurants .
but the latest information we have confirms that human beings are now a far bigger threat to sharks than sharks ever were to us . "
on thursday , the european union 's executive in brussels launched a series of proposals designed to help rebuild depleted shark stocks in european waters .
these involve reducing catches , increasing scientific research and stepping up controls .
eu fleets fish about 100,000 tonnes of shark each year , about an eighth of the world 's total catches .
europe providing fins for asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a third of all shark fins exported to hong kong come from europe shark fin is considered a delicacy in asia and can retail for anything between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 per kilogram in china .
a third of all the fins exported to hong kong , the world 's biggest importer , come from europe , according to the shark alliance - an international coalition of about 60 conservationist organizations .
most of the european fins which arrive in asia are fished by spanish , french , british , italian and portuguese fleets .
meanwhile , more and more europeans find themselves eating shark meat , whether knowingly or not .
it is used to prepare " schillerlocken " in germany and portuguese " caldeirada " stew , but it can also be found in british fish-and-chip shops .
within eu waters , most fishing takes place in the north sea and the atlantic ocean .
but there is also considerable activity in the mediterranean sea .
limits on the amounts of catches are already in place , and " finning " - the practice of removing the fins and discarding the rest of the shark at sea - is illegal in the eu .
but slack controls mean that of the about 180 species found in europe , a third are now threatened with extinction , according to the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- . dpa news agency -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we had to do more after conceding the early goal and we created enough chances , " klinsmann said .
" the team put a lot into the game and the win was more than deserved . " it was one-way traffic for the first 45 minutes as bayern piled on the pressure and keeper roman weidenfeller twice did well to save from klose .

" a game lasts 90 minutes and you just have to forget things , " klose said of the missed chances before scoring .

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police . " america will do more .
the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well , " us vice-president joe biden told the conference on saturday . that call is likely to cause anxiety in europe , where the afghan campaign is far from popular with voters , and where some governments are reluctant to commit soldiers to the hottest combat areas , despite fierce pressure from allies such as britain and canada . it will be a particularly sensitive issue in germany , which faces federal elections in september .
nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police . " america will do more .
the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well , " us vice-president joe biden told the conference on saturday . that call is likely to cause anxiety in europe , where the afghan campaign is far from popular with voters , and where some governments are reluctant to commit soldiers to the hottest combat areas , despite fierce pressure from allies such as britain and canada . it will be a particularly sensitive issue in germany , which faces federal elections in september .
nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .
a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu plans to spread broadband internet connections to the countryside barroso 's spokesman , johannes laitenberger , said on friday that the commission had been aware of the council 's legal opinion for some time .
" and we do n't agree with it , " laitenberger said .
" this is primarily a political , not a juridical issue .
the european commission will continue to endeavor to find a solution , " he said .
the issue is to be discussed by eu finance ministers meeting in brussels on monday and tuesday .
" we have listened to the comments made by the member states ... and we are strongly persuaded that the outcome of the discussions will be fruitful , " officials from the czech presidency of the eu said on friday .
eu governments agreed in principle to use the 5 billions euros from the eu 's budget 's reserves at a summit in december , but a final decision is not expected before the spring council in march .

brussels officials said they would go ahead with plans to invest billions of taxpayers ' money on energy and internet projects despite political and legal objections from key eu players such as germany , france and italy . european commission president jose manuel barroso wants to use 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.4 billion -rrb- of what he says are spare eu budget funds to link up the member states ' electricity grids , build gas pipelines , create wind farms and spread broadband internet connections to the countryside .
barroso says the projects would help improve energy security and make europe greener while at the same time providing a much-needed shot in the arm to the bloc 's economy , which is suffering from its worst recession in decades .
but some governments object to the plans , either because they would need to provide the money themselves , or because they are not interested in the projects .
they have now obtained the backing of the eu 's legal services in brussels , which have concluded that most of what the commission calls " unspent " eu euros can not in fact be used .
" the 3.5-billion-euro margin from the 2008 budget is no longer available , " diplomatic sources in brussels told dpa news service .
the remaining 1.5 billion euros , however , could still be used since they belong to the 2009 budget chapter on agriculture and fisheries , the source said .

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police . " america will do more .
the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well , " us vice-president joe biden told the conference on saturday . that call is likely to cause anxiety in europe , where the afghan campaign is far from popular with voters , and where some governments are reluctant to commit soldiers to the hottest combat areas , despite fierce pressure from allies such as britain and canada . it will be a particularly sensitive issue in germany , which faces federal elections in september .
nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .
last year at the berlinale , craggy-faced iranian star reza naji received the best actor award for his portrayal of a harassed father in director majid majidi 's " the song of sparrows .

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .
and he is doing this with the support of the vatican , which is a strong ally , " walston said .
dying with dignity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beppino englaro struggled to find a hospice that would withdraw food from his comatose daughter englaro 's father , beppino , who has for over a decade battled in italy 's courts for what he says is his daughter 's " right-to-die with dignity " , condemned the government 's decision .
napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .

by then , medical experts say , eluana englaro , will have started to manifest muscle spasms and other serious symptoms related to the suspension , which began friday , of nutrients and water previously supplied to her body through tubes .
the case of the 38-year-old englaro , who has spent the last 17 years in a vegetative state after a car accident , has reignited debate in catholic italy over euthanasia and its legal technicalities .
prime minister silvio berlusconi on friday announced the government would press forward with a law after italian president giorgio napolitano refused to sign a government decree overturning a court order allowing the termination of englaro 's life .
the vatican weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican insists that all human life must be protected in an unusual clash with the president , the vatican voiced its support for berlusconi in this case , pleading napolitano to change his mind .
" i think the government is doing everything possible to save eluana 's life , " cardinal javier lozano barragan , the vatican 's health minister , told italia 1 television on saturday .
" we ask the lord that the president of the republic can reconsider … and find a way to reconcile this decree with the italian constitution . "
analysts , on the other hand , said berlusconi was using his opposition to the courts and the head of state to further cement his power in the country .
" he is trying to reduce the power of the courts and the residual powers of the president , and he already has control of both houses of parliament , " said james walston , who teaches italian politics at the american university of rome .
" if he succeeds , it 's a form of coup .
he is basically changing the italian constitution .

napolitano , who as head of state has a say in constitutional matters , said the government through its decree on eluana , was interfering with a ruling made by italy 's independent judiciary .
but roman catholic church officials , conservative politicians and others who have campaigned to keep eluana alive , say the court order amounts to euthanasia , a procedure not permitted under italian law .
beppino , earlier this week had his daughter moved to a hospice in the north-eastern city of udine after doctors there said they would be willing to carry out a court order allowing the termination of her life .
the case is reminiscent of that of american terri schiavo who was in a vegetative state for 15 years before she was allowed to die in 2005 , after a prolonged legal struggle by her husband to have her disconnected from life support .
threats of disciplinary action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister berlusconi is piling pressure on president napolitano since a july 2008 ruling by italy 's top court , the cassation , upheld beppino 's request to allow his daughter to die , several government officials have threatened disciplinary action against clinics and doctors willing to carry out the order .

the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- says eu plans to limit science-based fishing limits , protect endangered species and a strong finning ban for some of europe 's most vulnerable and neglected animals , lacks teeth . most people do not associate sharks with europe - " jaws " was filmed near cape cod , massachusetts , not in portugal .
but sustained demand for fins from asia , and a growing appetite for shark meat back home are placing many european cousins of the great white on the path of extinction .
as joe borg , the european union 's fisheries commissioner , put it : " many people associate sharks with going to the cinema , more than with beaches or restaurants .
but the latest information we have confirms that human beings are now a far bigger threat to sharks than sharks ever were to us . "
on thursday , the european union 's executive in brussels launched a series of proposals designed to help rebuild depleted shark stocks in european waters .
these involve reducing catches , increasing scientific research and stepping up controls .
eu fleets fish about 100,000 tonnes of shark each year , about an eighth of the world 's total catches .
europe providing fins for asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a third of all shark fins exported to hong kong come from europe shark fin is considered a delicacy in asia and can retail for anything between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 per kilogram in china .
a third of all the fins exported to hong kong , the world 's biggest importer , come from europe , according to the shark alliance - an international coalition of about 60 conservationist organizations .
most of the european fins which arrive in asia are fished by spanish , french , british , italian and portuguese fleets .
meanwhile , more and more europeans find themselves eating shark meat , whether knowingly or not .
it is used to prepare " schillerlocken " in germany and portuguese " caldeirada " stew , but it can also be found in british fish-and-chip shops .
within eu waters , most fishing takes place in the north sea and the atlantic ocean .
but there is also considerable activity in the mediterranean sea .
limits on the amounts of catches are already in place , and " finning " - the practice of removing the fins and discarding the rest of the shark at sea - is illegal in the eu .
but slack controls mean that of the about 180 species found in europe , a third are now threatened with extinction , according to the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- . dpa news agency -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .

nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants .

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there appears to a number of clubs in serious danger of going bankrupt , " said rummenigge in an interview with daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" not just in england , spanish and italian clubs also have massive problems . " even big-spending chelsea , the london soccer club controlled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , has been hit by the credit crunch and will sign fewer new players this season .
ceo peter kenyon said the team was taking a prudent view and reviewing its cost base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack earned more than 15 million euros in 2008 abramovich has pumped around 689 million euros -lrb- $ 903 million -rrb- into chelsea since acquiring it in 2003 , which included the signing of germany midfielder michael ballack . rummenigge said the situations in france and germany , where there are stricter licensing rules , are better . " but nobody can predict how things are going to look tomorrow when the world is in such a financial turmoil , " said the bayern boss .
" that 's why you should keep your powder dry , or money , so you can reload if there are lucrative opportunities . " the current catchphrase is " sink costs " and most clubs used the winter transfer window to reduce the size of their squads rather than sign new players . " soccer must realize that the business can no longer reckon with growth , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- vice president peter peters , even though the effects of the economic slowdown have yet to fully hit many of the country 's top clubs . top-flight bundesliga side schalke 04 offloaded seven players and dortmund six with loan signings now the preferred method of signing up new talent . corporate ticket sales are also suffering with bayer leverkusen especially hard hit as the club is looking to sell 2,400 business seats when its bayarena stadium is completed in the summer . financial shootout in the lower leagues the situation is worse .
there has been no frantic spending spree during this season 's transfer window .
this winter only 45 new players were signed in the third division compared to a transfer record of 65 last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams hope they 'll be able to get back on their feet after the crisis " the league is turning into a financial shootout , " said dirk eichebaum , president of stuttgarter kickers . borussia dortmund ceo hans-joachim watzke expects repercussions for the bundesliga over the medium term , saying " there will be cuts and bruises . " " we were lucky to cut debts by 50 million euros at the right time , " said watzke .
" in today 's climate that would n't have been possible .
it is also important that we were able to extend contracts on a long-term basis with our big sponsors shortly before the start of the international financial crisis . " borussia moenchengladbach , karlsruhe , energie cottbus , vfl bochum and hertha berlin face an uncertain year .
they are all looking for new sponsorship deals with their partners when the contracts run out at the end of the 2009 season . schalke president josef schnusenberg said he remains confident that the bundesliga can come out of the economic slowdown in a stronger position than when it went in . " i am convinced that the bundesliga is the model of the future for european soccer because the solid financial standing of our clubs will be to our long-term advantage , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .
bad timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , right , and gloss , middle , are said to have had a poor working relationship seehofer initially rejected the offer , but questions arose over whether gloss should stay in office after publicly expressing a wish to go .
the daily der tagesspiegel noted on sunday that glos could not have picked a worse time to resign and that its execution could have hardly been any more awkward .
" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the csu lost its absolute majority in bavaria glos has headed the economy ministry since november 2005 when the cdu and csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .
last month the government announced a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 65-billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there appears to a number of clubs in serious danger of going bankrupt , " said rummenigge in an interview with daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" not just in england , spanish and italian clubs also have massive problems . " even big-spending chelsea , the london soccer club controlled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , has been hit by the credit crunch and will sign fewer new players this season .
ceo peter kenyon said the team was taking a prudent view and reviewing its cost base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack earned more than 15 million euros in 2008 abramovich has pumped around 689 million euros -lrb- $ 903 million -rrb- into chelsea since acquiring it in 2003 , which included the signing of germany midfielder michael ballack . rummenigge said the situations in france and germany , where there are stricter licensing rules , are better . " but nobody can predict how things are going to look tomorrow when the world is in such a financial turmoil , " said the bayern boss .
" that 's why you should keep your powder dry , or money , so you can reload if there are lucrative opportunities . " the current catchphrase is " sink costs " and most clubs used the winter transfer window to reduce the size of their squads rather than sign new players . " soccer must realize that the business can no longer reckon with growth , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- vice president peter peters , even though the effects of the economic slowdown have yet to fully hit many of the country 's top clubs . top-flight bundesliga side schalke 04 offloaded seven players and dortmund six with loan signings now the preferred method of signing up new talent . corporate ticket sales are also suffering with bayer leverkusen especially hard hit as the club is looking to sell 2,400 business seats when its bayarena stadium is completed in the summer . financial shootout in the lower leagues the situation is worse .
there has been no frantic spending spree during this season 's transfer window .
this winter only 45 new players were signed in the third division compared to a transfer record of 65 last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams hope they 'll be able to get back on their feet after the crisis " the league is turning into a financial shootout , " said dirk eichebaum , president of stuttgarter kickers . borussia dortmund ceo hans-joachim watzke expects repercussions for the bundesliga over the medium term , saying " there will be cuts and bruises . " " we were lucky to cut debts by 50 million euros at the right time , " said watzke .
" in today 's climate that would n't have been possible .
it is also important that we were able to extend contracts on a long-term basis with our big sponsors shortly before the start of the international financial crisis . " borussia moenchengladbach , karlsruhe , energie cottbus , vfl bochum and hertha berlin face an uncertain year .
they are all looking for new sponsorship deals with their partners when the contracts run out at the end of the 2009 season . schalke president josef schnusenberg said he remains confident that the bundesliga can come out of the economic slowdown in a stronger position than when it went in . " i am convinced that the bundesliga is the model of the future for european soccer because the solid financial standing of our clubs will be to our long-term advantage , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is absolutely necessary in afghanistan to implement the process -lrb- of security and reconstruction -rrb- even more effectively .
there can be no development without security , but there can be no security without development either , " german defense minister franz-josef jung told the munich security conference on sunday , feb .
8 . " we will not win by military means alone , " he said . jung opened a debate with us national security advisor james jones and afghan president hamid karzai at a time when western leaders are becoming increasingly critical of karzai 's regime and nato members are struggling to raise troops to combat the taliban . nato has sent some 55,000 troops to the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan , almost half of them from the united states . but the alliance is fighting an increasingly bitter battle against the resurgent taliban , with commanders on the ground calling out for more soldiers . us requests may vex germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the new us administration will expect more from its partners us president barack obama has pledged to almost double the number of us troops in afghanistan , but has called on european members to boost their efforts in the country , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police . " america will do more .
the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well , " us vice-president joe biden told the conference on saturday . that call is likely to cause anxiety in europe , where the afghan campaign is far from popular with voters , and where some governments are reluctant to commit soldiers to the hottest combat areas , despite fierce pressure from allies such as britain and canada . it will be a particularly sensitive issue in germany , which faces federal elections in september .
nato officials say that they are keen to avoid the afghan mission becoming an electoral issue . jung said that given the rapid growth of the afghan army , " the number of troops is sufficient : what we need is more reconstruction and more effort in building up the afghan armed forces . " germany has decided to treble to 21 the number of training teams it sends to afghanistan and to more than double its reconstruction aid to 170 million euros -lrb- $ 220 million -rrb- , he said . pledges to work with pakistan at the same time , western capitals have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of karzai 's government , which they accuse of inefficiency , corruption and stalling key reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karzai has been criticized by the west in return , karzai has demanded that nato do more to prevent civilian casualties in his country , a call jung echoed on sunday . obama has pledged to widen us efforts in the region to take in pakistan - frequently portrayed as a safe haven for militants . " we have to make an effective contribution to secure the borders together with pakistan , " jung said . later on sunday , pakistan 's foreign minister makhdoom qureshi was set to debate the future of nato 's afghan mission with , among others , british defense minister john hutton and us general david petraeus , who scored some of the earliest successes in stabilizing iraq . richard holbrooke , obama 's special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , was also due to join the debate . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .
27 . glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had offered to resign on saturday , but he was immediately turned down by his party boss , horst seehofer . in a letter to seehofer , 64-year-old glos cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of this year 's national polls . merkel has not officially commented on the matter , but steinmeier indicated the minister 's action was related to internal quarrels within the csu , the most junior of the three parties that form the ruling coalition in berlin . the csu " is taking part in a steeplechase .
i 've no idea what the outcome will be , " steinmeier told national public broadcaster ard .
the foreign minister is the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in the upcoming federal elections . despite having his resignation turned down , reuters news agency quoted anonymous sources saying they did not expect him to stay in his position too much longer .
the online edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung also reported on sunday that glos would be replaced soon . instability in the conservative christian parties leadership has given steinmeier an opportunity to criticize merkel 's handling of the economic crisis . in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine to be published on monday , steinmeier said merkel and her allies were " incapable of finding the right way to face the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis . " " it is only thanks to the spd that ms. merkel , as chancellor , has been able to make the right decisions , " said steinmeier , who currently acts as vice-chancellor .
he had previously been more cautious in criticizing merkel so as not to upset the uneasy coalition . bad timing for a resignation the daily tagesspiegel on sunday noted that glos picked a particularly awkward time to submit his resignation as germany is struggling to come to terms with a harsh recession that has seen growth fall , unemployment rise and credit dry up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's criticism of merkel indicates national elections are looming " michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic crisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of this ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " opined the paper . as economics minister , glos was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
that was most apparent last month when the government announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . glos has headed the economics ministry since november 2005 when merkel 's christian democrats and the csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats .
he joined the csu since 1970 and was elected to parliament in 1976 .
before moving to his cabinet job , he was leader of the csu parliamentary group in berlin . greens : let glos leave formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government . opposition greens party 's parliamentary leader renate kuenast said the government should let the minister go . " it is damaging for germany to hold on to an economics minister who has called ' get me out of here , " ' she said in a reference to the popular reality television series " i 'm a celebrity get me out of here .

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 .

but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spokespeople said the talk was marked by " mutual respect . " merkel was the first government leader to take the unusual step of calling on german-born pope benedict xvi to demand a traditionalist bishop readmitted to the catholic church retract statements he made denying the extent of the holocaust . the pope and the chancellor explained their views during the conversation on sunday , feb .
8 , " with the greatest of mutual respect , " according to a joint statement released by the vatican and german press spokesman . " it was a good and constructive talk , carried by the deep and constant reminder that the shoah holds for humanity , " the statement said .
the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- says eu plans to limit science-based fishing limits , protect endangered species and a strong finning ban for some of europe 's most vulnerable and neglected animals , lacks teeth . most people do not associate sharks with europe - " jaws " was filmed near cape cod , massachusetts , not in portugal .
but sustained demand for fins from asia , and a growing appetite for shark meat back home are placing many european cousins of the great white on the path of extinction .
as joe borg , the european union 's fisheries commissioner , put it : " many people associate sharks with going to the cinema , more than with beaches or restaurants .
but the latest information we have confirms that human beings are now a far bigger threat to sharks than sharks ever were to us . "
on thursday , the european union 's executive in brussels launched a series of proposals designed to help rebuild depleted shark stocks in european waters .
these involve reducing catches , increasing scientific research and stepping up controls .
eu fleets fish about 100,000 tonnes of shark each year , about an eighth of the world 's total catches .
europe providing fins for asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a third of all shark fins exported to hong kong come from europe shark fin is considered a delicacy in asia and can retail for anything between $ 1,000 and $ 10,000 per kilogram in china .
a third of all the fins exported to hong kong , the world 's biggest importer , come from europe , according to the shark alliance - an international coalition of about 60 conservationist organizations .
most of the european fins which arrive in asia are fished by spanish , french , british , italian and portuguese fleets .
meanwhile , more and more europeans find themselves eating shark meat , whether knowingly or not .
it is used to prepare " schillerlocken " in germany and portuguese " caldeirada " stew , but it can also be found in british fish-and-chip shops .
within eu waters , most fishing takes place in the north sea and the atlantic ocean .
but there is also considerable activity in the mediterranean sea .
limits on the amounts of catches are already in place , and " finning " - the practice of removing the fins and discarding the rest of the shark at sea - is illegal in the eu .
but slack controls mean that of the about 180 species found in europe , a third are now threatened with extinction , according to the international union for conservation of nature -lrb- iucn -rrb- . dpa news agency -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , nearly one in six members of the german soccer association is female . " come on , the strikers have to show themselves ! " shouts coach cosimo martina during soccer practice .
fortuna koeln , a traditional club in southern cologne , is among those which have recently expanded their girls ' programs . fourteen-year-old theresa garsztecki , who 's played for fortuna koeln for six years already , is one of the senior members on the team .
her friend luzie schwarz , who has been involved for just as long , started playing soccer almost by chance . " when my little brother joined a soccer team , i wanted to do it too , " said luzie . role models at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women won their last world cup title in china in 2007 luzie and theresa are n't alone in their passion for the sport .
the german soccer association currently has over one million female members .
interest skyrocketed last year , with sign-ups jumping five percent over 2007 . the recent success of the national women 's team - they 've won the last two world cups - certainly has something to do with it . " the girls sure have enough role models here at home , " said hans-juergen tritschoks , who used to coach the successful women 's team 1 .
fcc frankfurt .
" just take birgit prinz , who has been player of the year three times . " tritschoks also named top players like renate lingor and nia kuenzer .
" those were and still are accessible stars , who patiently give autographs after every game . " little attention from the media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male soccer players , like lukas podolski , get much more media attention still , the national players are seldom seen on tv and in the media . " i think women 's soccer is n't reported on enough , " said theresa .
luzie agreed : " male soccer players are in the media a lot more , often with a photo or an extra story , or something . " so it 's no surprise that the girls also look to national men 's player lukas podolski as a role model .

now , nearly one in six members of the german soccer association is female . " come on , the strikers have to show themselves ! " shouts coach cosimo martina during soccer practice .
fortuna koeln , a traditional club in southern cologne , is among those which have recently expanded their girls ' programs . fourteen-year-old theresa garsztecki , who 's played for fortuna koeln for six years already , is one of the senior members on the team .
her friend luzie schwarz , who has been involved for just as long , started playing soccer almost by chance . " when my little brother joined a soccer team , i wanted to do it too , " said luzie . role models at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women won their last world cup title in china in 2007 luzie and theresa are n't alone in their passion for the sport .
the german soccer association currently has over one million female members .
interest skyrocketed last year , with sign-ups jumping five percent over 2007 . the recent success of the national women 's team - they 've won the last two world cups - certainly has something to do with it .

" i think women 's soccer is n't reported on enough , " said theresa .
luzie agreed : " male soccer players are in the media a lot more , often with a photo or an extra story , or something . " so it 's no surprise that the girls also look to national men 's player lukas podolski as a role model .
however , podolski and his team members simply have a physical advantage , when it comes to sprints , goal shots and head kicks , said tritschoks . " thanks to professional training , the -lrb- women 's -rrb- game has gotten a lot quicker and more athletic , " he said .

playmobil turned 35 this week , but its creator , hans beck , died just short of the occasion . thirty-five years have passed since the first playmobil toys sparked children 's imaginations and their still on the job .
many adults , too , remember their first playmobil figures fondly , which , when they first hit the market , were only available in green , blue , red or yellow .
the accessories were limited , but distinctive , allowing a child to turn a american indian into a policeman in the blink of an eye .
the 7.5-centimeter -lrb- three-inch -rrb- men were created out of necessity .
the oil crisis of the 1970s spelled financial doom for the toy manufacturer geobra brandstaetter when the cost of producing large pieces of plastic became too much .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil creator hans beck died just days before the 35th anniversary company owner horst brandstaetter asked his research director hans beck to come up with a toy figures for children .
on jan .
30 , 2009 , hans beck died at the age of 79 and was unable to see his creation turn 35 . industry doubtful , but children excited in 1974 , there was 19 different articles in the playmobil line : construction worker , american indian , and knight figurines and all the accessories to create three different imaginary worlds .
the figures were an instant success , mostly due to the fact that children were able to act out the world their parents and other adults lived in with figures that could actually grab on to things or bend their legs to sit in a car .
no one , however , expected such long-term success , but today , 35 years later , over 2.2 billion figures have been produced .
fan letters from kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction workers were among the original figures created in the 1970s children have sent in countless letters over the years asking if the company could make their playmobil figures .
this past summer , for example , most of the letters asked for school playsets .
however , there are clear limits to the kinds of things the company will produce , explains playmobil managing director andrea schauer .
there is no such thing as a playmobil soldier or an iraq war play set , but the battle between good and evil can be acted out through chivalrous knights or police officers .
playmobil figures are so famous they 've even managed to make it onto the stage and television .
in stuttgart schiller 's opera " the robbers " was acted out using playmobil and television host harald schmidt uses the figures to act out different scenarios on his late night talk show . helga spannhake -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " we were lucky to cut debts by 50 million euros at the right time , " said watzke .

they are all looking for new sponsorship deals with their partners when the contracts run out at the end of the 2009 season . schalke president josef schnusenberg said he remains confident that the bundesliga can come out of the economic slowdown in a stronger position than when it went in . " i am convinced that the bundesliga is the model of the future for european soccer because the solid financial standing of our clubs will be to our long-term advantage , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there appears to a number of clubs in serious danger of going bankrupt , " said rummenigge in an interview with daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" not just in england , spanish and italian clubs also have massive problems . " even big-spending chelsea , the london soccer club controlled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , has been hit by the credit crunch and will sign fewer new players this season .
ceo peter kenyon said the team was taking a prudent view and reviewing its cost base . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack earned more than 15 million euros in 2008 abramovich has pumped around 689 million euros -lrb- $ 903 million -rrb- into chelsea since acquiring it in 2003 , which included the signing of germany midfielder michael ballack . rummenigge said the situations in france and germany , where there are stricter licensing rules , are better . " but nobody can predict how things are going to look tomorrow when the world is in such a financial turmoil , " said the bayern boss .
" that 's why you should keep your powder dry , or money , so you can reload if there are lucrative opportunities . " the current catchphrase is " sink costs " and most clubs used the winter transfer window to reduce the size of their squads rather than sign new players . " soccer must realize that the business can no longer reckon with growth , " said german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- vice president peter peters , even though the effects of the economic slowdown have yet to fully hit many of the country 's top clubs . top-flight bundesliga side schalke 04 offloaded seven players and dortmund six with loan signings now the preferred method of signing up new talent . corporate ticket sales are also suffering with bayer leverkusen especially hard hit as the club is looking to sell 2,400 business seats when its bayarena stadium is completed in the summer . financial shootout in the lower leagues the situation is worse .
there has been no frantic spending spree during this season 's transfer window .
this winter only 45 new players were signed in the third division compared to a transfer record of 65 last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams hope they 'll be able to get back on their feet after the crisis " the league is turning into a financial shootout , " said dirk eichebaum , president of stuttgarter kickers . borussia dortmund ceo hans-joachim watzke expects repercussions for the bundesliga over the medium term , saying " there will be cuts and bruises . " " we were lucky to cut debts by 50 million euros at the right time , " said watzke .
" in today 's climate that would n't have been possible .
it is also important that we were able to extend contracts on a long-term basis with our big sponsors shortly before the start of the international financial crisis . " borussia moenchengladbach , karlsruhe , energie cottbus , vfl bochum and hertha berlin face an uncertain year .
they are all looking for new sponsorship deals with their partners when the contracts run out at the end of the 2009 season . schalke president josef schnusenberg said he remains confident that the bundesliga can come out of the economic slowdown in a stronger position than when it went in . " i am convinced that the bundesliga is the model of the future for european soccer because the solid financial standing of our clubs will be to our long-term advantage , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nrt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there are no problems with this film , " farhadi told a news conference after the movie about attitudes towards life was screened at the berlin film festival on saturday .
press reports had said iranian authorities sought to have the film banned because of its content about the role of women and the question of honor in relationships between couples .
but this was not true , said the director as he addressed journalists with leading members of the cast , including actress golshifteh farahani , 25 , star of the hollywood movie " body of lies . "
farhadi blamed the media for exaggerating the controversy surrounding the film .
" i think they really blew things up out of all proportion , " he said .
" i am quite confident the film will not have difficulties in iran .
in fact , it is being shown in tehran tonight , after the premiere in berlin . "
a storm in a teacup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director says his movie will be shown in teheran farahani , who plays the female lead in the two-hour drama , spoke of " a storm in a teacup " and refuted claims that she herself was experiencing difficulties with the authorities because of her roles .
" i do n't have any problems in going back to iran .
i 've never had such problems .
it 's just propaganda , " said the 25-year-old , who played opposite heartthrob leonardo dicaprio in " body of lies . "
" about elly " - darbareye elly in persian - is about a group of friends who travel to the coast of north iran for a brief holiday with their children .
kindergarten teacher elly is also part of the group .
the young woman was invited with the aim of pairing her up with a young man who has just returned from germany after obtaining a divorce from his german wife .
the exuberant mood of the group rapidly changes when elly vanishes on the second day after an incident on the beach .
when it transpires she was engaged to another man , the initially positive image of the young woman is dismantled and conflicts with moral values emerge beneath the cool , modern surface of the group in their mid-to-late 30s .
coveted award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " about elly " is ashgar farhadi 's fourth feature film " about elly " is one of 26 entries contending for the golden bear award for best film at this year 's berlinale , which opened on thursday and runs until feb .
15 .
it is the fourth feature film by isfahan-born farhadi , who also wrote the script .
" what was important to me was to make a universal film that could be enjoyed all over the world , " he said .
" there is nothing immoral about this film in terms of iranian culture , " he said , referring to the fact that elly had decided to go on the holiday with her friends without telling her fiancée .
" to my mind it kind of reflects the difficulties we face in everyday life , " said the director , whose " fireworks wednesday " received an award at the chicago film festival in 2006 .
the audience in berlin rewarded " about elly " with warm applause .
last year at the berlinale , craggy-faced iranian star reza naji received the best actor award for his portrayal of a harassed father in director majid majidi 's " the song of sparrows .

8 . official results showed 59.6 percent supported expanding the existing deal with 25 european states and allowing free access to citizens of the two youngest eu members romania and bulgaria , according to initial voting returns from the 26 swiss cantons . the accord will extend to romanians and bulgarians the same rights to work in switzerland that are already enjoyed by the rest of the 27-member bloc 's members .
three small german-speaking cantons and the italian-speaking canton of ticino voted against the accord , with the other 22 french and german-speaking cantons in favor of it . european commission president jose manuel barroso welcomed what he called an " excellent result " from the vote . " this is a key agreement for relations between the european union and switzerland , " he said in a statement .
" the positive vote from the swiss people opens the way to strengthening ties in areas of mutual interest . " the swiss vote stands in contrast to growing calls for protectionism in other european nations , including british energy workers striking over foreign workers employed to work at an oil refinery as well striking french workers demanding pay increases and job protection . economy vs. immigration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp was against a " free ride for everyone " the poll put switzerland 's economic interests against populist fears concerning immigration and the country 's independence . allowing eu citizens to work in switzerland has supported the swiss economy by helping the alpine nation overcome a shortage of skilled workers .
the deal also allows swiss citizens to take up employment anywhere in the eu . supporters of the " yes " vote , including most swiss politicians , business and social leaders , said closing the border to a pair of eu members would put swiss ties to brussels at risk and jeopardize the economy , which is already suffering under the global financial crisis . also using the economic crisis as a backdrop , opponents of the deal , led by the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- , stirred up fears that bulgarian and romanian immigrants posed a threat to swiss jobs . the svp , switzerland 's biggest party , issued a poster depicting ravenous crows pecking at a map of switzerland and called bulgaria and romania " europe 's third world . " " i think that the leap into the unknown , fears about unforeseen consequences probably prompted those who were hesitant to vote yes , " svp parliamentarian guy parmelin said on swiss television . more than one million of switzerland 's 1.62 million foreign residents come from the european union and elsewhere in western europe .
their number has grown by nearly 200,000 since limits on employing eu citizens were gradually lifted from 2002 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , nearly one in six members of the german soccer association is female . " come on , the strikers have to show themselves ! " shouts coach cosimo martina during soccer practice .
fortuna koeln , a traditional club in southern cologne , is among those which have recently expanded their girls ' programs . fourteen-year-old theresa garsztecki , who 's played for fortuna koeln for six years already , is one of the senior members on the team .
her friend luzie schwarz , who has been involved for just as long , started playing soccer almost by chance . " when my little brother joined a soccer team , i wanted to do it too , " said luzie . role models at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women won their last world cup title in china in 2007 luzie and theresa are n't alone in their passion for the sport .
the german soccer association currently has over one million female members .
interest skyrocketed last year , with sign-ups jumping five percent over 2007 . the recent success of the national women 's team - they 've won the last two world cups - certainly has something to do with it . " the girls sure have enough role models here at home , " said hans-juergen tritschoks , who used to coach the successful women 's team 1 .
fcc frankfurt .
" just take birgit prinz , who has been player of the year three times . " tritschoks also named top players like renate lingor and nia kuenzer .

" little attention from the media bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male soccer players , like lukas podolski , get much more media attention still , the national players are seldom seen on tv and in the media . " i think women 's soccer is n't reported on enough , " said theresa .
luzie agreed : " male soccer players are in the media a lot more , often with a photo or an extra story , or something . " so it 's no surprise that the girls also look to national men 's player lukas podolski as a role model .
however , podolski and his team members simply have a physical advantage , when it comes to sprints , goal shots and head kicks , said tritschoks . " thanks to professional training , the -lrb- women 's -rrb- game has gotten a lot quicker and more athletic , " he said .
" but women just have less muscle mass and therefore less power . " keep going when it hurts nevertheless , women bring just as much technical finesse to the game , added tritschoks - and they have a one-up on their male colleagues in at least one area . " unlike the men , the women just stand right up again after they 've been fouled and keep playing . " for theresa , combining her hobby with school is a challenge .
she goes to practice twice a week , has to keep up with her homework , and has games on the weekends . " i also like to put on makeup and go out to parties , " said theresa .

the telephone conversation came at the request of the chancellor , who earlier this week aroused the vatican 's ire by saying the catholic church had not spoken clearly enough in rejecting holocaust denial . she was reacting to remarks made by bishop richard williamson , one of four traditionalist bishops with the conservative st. pius x society whose 1988 excommunication was lifted by the pontiff . outcry in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than half of germany 's catholics want williamson kicked out of the church again the move by benedict xvi , formerly cardinal joseph ratzinger , was condemned by jewish groups and led to an outcry in his native germany , where merkel joined in the criticism . the chancellor came under fire from conservative elements in her christian democrat and christian social union alliance , who accused here of meddling in church affairs . benedict 's decision to rehabilitate the four bishops was seen a sign that the renegade group was willing to reconcile with rome .
but amid mounting pressure , the vatican eventually issued a statement saying williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church . merkel welcomed the vatican 's statement as " an important and good signal . " british-born williamson , who lives in argentina , denied there were gas chambers at the nazis ' death camp in auschwitz and alleging the scale of deaths of jews under the nazis was no more than " 200,000 to 300,000 . " he refused to change the stance he made in a swedish television interview days before his excommunication was lifted but told the german weekly der spiegel that he would reexamine the historical evidence . " if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- .
but all that will take time , " he was quoted as saying . an opinion poll in germany found that two-thirds of german catholics think the decision to allow williamson back into the church was harmful , the weekly bild am sonntag reported .
some 56 percent of people polled said williamson should excommunicated for a second time . the vatican has said pope benedict , who has expressed his full solidarity with jews , was not aware of williamson 's denial of the holocaust when he readmitted the bishops to the catholic flock in an attempt to heal a 20-year-old division in the church . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some experts say they do n't expect him to remain in the position for too much longer . the newspaper bild am sonntag said the chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier wanted glos to remain in office until general elections are held on sept .
27 . glos , a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union , had offered to resign on saturday , but he was immediately turned down by his party boss , horst seehofer . in a letter to seehofer , 64-year-old glos cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of this year 's national polls . merkel has not officially commented on the matter , but steinmeier indicated the minister 's action was related to internal quarrels within the csu , the most junior of the three parties that form the ruling coalition in berlin . the csu " is taking part in a steeplechase .
i 've no idea what the outcome will be , " steinmeier told national public broadcaster ard .
the foreign minister is the social democratic party 's candidate for the chancellery in the upcoming federal elections . despite having his resignation turned down , reuters news agency quoted anonymous sources saying they did not expect him to stay in his position too much longer .
the online edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung also reported on sunday that glos would be replaced soon . instability in the conservative christian parties leadership has given steinmeier an opportunity to criticize merkel 's handling of the economic crisis . in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine to be published on monday , steinmeier said merkel and her allies were " incapable of finding the right way to face the -lrb- economic -rrb- crisis . " " it is only thanks to the spd that ms. merkel , as chancellor , has been able to make the right decisions , " said steinmeier , who currently acts as vice-chancellor .
he had previously been more cautious in criticizing merkel so as not to upset the uneasy coalition . bad timing for a resignation the daily tagesspiegel on sunday noted that glos picked a particularly awkward time to submit his resignation as germany is struggling to come to terms with a harsh recession that has seen growth fall , unemployment rise and credit dry up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's criticism of merkel indicates national elections are looming " michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic crisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of this ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " opined the paper . as economics minister , glos was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
that was most apparent last month when the government announced a 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 65 billion -rrb- fiscal stimulus package to help europe 's biggest economy weather the economic downturn . glos has headed the economics ministry since november 2005 when merkel 's christian democrats and the csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats .
he joined the csu since 1970 and was elected to parliament in 1976 .
before moving to his cabinet job , he was leader of the csu parliamentary group in berlin . greens : let glos leave formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government . opposition greens party 's parliamentary leader renate kuenast said the government should let the minister go . " it is damaging for germany to hold on to an economics minister who has called ' get me out of here , " ' she said in a reference to the popular reality television series " i 'm a celebrity get me out of here .

" i will ask the chancellor tomorrow morning to propose my resignation to the president , " glos told zdf television on sunday after a crisis meeting with the leader of his christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party , horst seehofer , in munich .
in a resignation offer to seehofer , which glos handed in on saturday , the minister cited his age and the need for the csu , after disappointing state election results last september , to renew itself ahead of the national polls .
sources within the csu said the minister 's poor relations with seehofer apparently prompted him to write the letter .
bad timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , right , and gloss , middle , are said to have had a poor working relationship seehofer initially rejected the offer , but questions arose over whether gloss should stay in office after publicly expressing a wish to go .
the daily der tagesspiegel noted on sunday that glos could not have picked a worse time to resign and that its execution could have hardly been any more awkward .
" michael glos offers to leave at a time when germany , europe and the whole world find themselves in the worst economic dcrisis of the last decades and countless decisions are expected of his ministry that could be decisive for the economic future of the whole country , " the newspaper said in an editorial .
sources close to the csu told dpa news service that glos would be replaced either by csu secretary general karl-theodor zu guttenberg or bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
formally , merkel is responsible for cabinet appointments , but in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the government .
party politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the csu lost its absolute majority in bavaria glos has headed the economy ministry since november 2005 when the cdu and csu took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last september and was forced to seek a coalition with the business-oriented free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
seehofer took over the party leadership after the debacle and was also appointed bavarian premier .
he later chose guttenberg to be the party 's secretary general .
guttenberg was elected in 2002 as a member of parliament in berlin and rose to become the csu 's spokesman there on disarmament and arms control .
an unhappy time a member of the csu since 1970 , glos had an unhappy time heading the economics ministry and was often in the shadow of the popular finance minister peer steinbrueck .
he indicated recently that he was growing tired of his job .
glos ' decision to quit comes at a time when germany is struggling to come to terms with a biting recession that has seen growth plummet , unemployment rise and credit dry up .

" there appears to a number of clubs in serious danger of going bankrupt , " said rummenigge in an interview with daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" not just in england , spanish and italian clubs also have massive problems . " even big-spending chelsea , the london soccer club controlled by russian billionaire roman abramovich , has been hit by the credit crunch and will sign fewer new players this season .

" but nobody can predict how things are going to look tomorrow when the world is in such a financial turmoil , " said the bayern boss .
" that 's why you should keep your powder dry , or money , so you can reload if there are lucrative opportunities . " the current catchphrase is " sink costs " and most clubs used the winter transfer window to reduce the size of their squads rather than sign new players .

" " we were lucky to cut debts by 50 million euros at the right time , " said watzke .
" in today 's climate that would n't have been possible .
it is also important that we were able to extend contracts on a long-term basis with our big sponsors shortly before the start of the international financial crisis . " borussia moenchengladbach , karlsruhe , energie cottbus , vfl bochum and hertha berlin face an uncertain year .
they are all looking for new sponsorship deals with their partners when the contracts run out at the end of the 2009 season . schalke president josef schnusenberg said he remains confident that the bundesliga can come out of the economic slowdown in a stronger position than when it went in .

the album , which has hit number one in more than 30 countries , has cemented the band 's reputation as a global phenomenon .
it has been named best rock album by the us recording academy , and coldplay went on to an award hat-trick including the coveted song of the year for viva la vida .
it is nine years since their first record , parachutes , debuted at the top of the charts .
lead single yellow became the summer 's anthem and , to top it all , the album received a mercury music prize nomination .
despite , or perhaps because of , their seemingly effortless success , the critical reaction to coldplay has always been mixed , and it has proved hard for them to shake an early description of their sound as " bedwetters ' music " .
nice guys the comment came from alan mcgee , the former creation label boss who discovered oasis .
he went on , " if coldplay have an attitude about anything , it 's passing their a-levels " .
it summed up the view that the group were just too middle class to rock .
indeed , the group formed at the distinctly not edgy university college , london .
frontman chris martin began on piano and vocals , though he has since branched out onto the mandolin and harmonica .
jonny buckland plays guitar , guy berryman bass and will champion drums .
martin 's school friend phil harvey , who was studying classics at oxford , was brought in as manager and the band still see him as their fifth member . "
the more people that like us , the more people seem to hate us " chris martin , 2001 early interviewers made frequent mention of the band 's educated backgrounds and the fact the lead singer did n't drink or eat meat , painting a picture of them as the nice guys of rock .
this was helped along by the band themselves , who shunned the trappings of rock and roll .
berryman said at the time : " we 're a band who like to keep ourselves to ourselves .
we do n't want to be in the gossip columns or be seen at film premieres with the latest celebrity girlfriend . "
" we want people to know us for our music - and only for our music - and not who we go out with . "
ironic , given that chris martin was later to draw tabloid attention for his relationship with , and eventual marriage to , hollywood actress gwyneth paltrow .
acclaim the fans did n't care about the image , though .
around 10,000 of them turned out for a mid-afternoon glastonbury set in 2000 .
but chris martin found the extremes of public acclaim and press criticism unsettling .
" the more people that like us , the more people seem to hate us , and it 's something nobody tells you how to deal with , " he said .
" we want to make one more record and try to make it the best record ever made , and then retire .
" i 'll become a busker , i think .
you get to sing what you like , no one 's out to get you . "
a rush of blood to the head was that next record , released in 2002 .
with the singles clocks , in my place and the scientist , the album perfected the band 's formula of piano-driven ballads with epic choruses .
again , the album went to the top of the charts and hoovered up awards - including three grammys and best album nods from q and the brits .
the band returned to glastonbury that year , this time as headliners .
media attention coldplay have always been outspoken on politics and their support for charities such as oxfam and amnesty international and in 2003 chris martin used the brits show as a platform to criticise the war in iraq .
the band have also kept tight control over the use of their music , turning down huge sums of money for tracks to be used in adverts .
" we would n't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs ' meanings like that " said martin .
after a frantic few years , the band retreated during 2003 , staying out of the spotlight and working on the next album .
but martin 's marriage to paltrow and the birth of their first child , apple , kept him , and by extension the band , in the media 's eye . "
we felt like we had to make music that would fill stadiums " guy berryman , 2008 in 2003 , martin found himself in the tabloids for a different reason when he was charged with smashing an australian photographer 's windscreen , a case which was later dropped .
further controversy followed when coldplay 's third album , x & y , was delayed by a year , a move which affected record label emi 's profits enough to cause a fall in the company 's share price .
a particular sound was being pushed on the band .
berryman said , " we felt like we had to make music that would fill stadiums " .
on the album 's eventual release , the band were again top of the charts , but the reviews were less enthusiastic this time .

there was criticism elsewhere of vague and meaningless lyrics on tracks like speed of sound and of a lack of progression from the previous album .
new direction perhaps by necessity , 2008 's viva la vida or death and all his friends , was produced by studio wizard brian eno , who prompted a change in style for coldplay .
the band had toured extensively in latin america and picked up hispanic influences for the new album .
the decision to take the vocals off one of the songs , life in technicolour , because it was " too much of an obvious single " showed a move away from the commerical , anthemic sound of previous works .
the band also took the unusual step of releasing the first single , violet hill , as a free download .
reviews of the album were generally positive but the band 's discomfort with the spotlight continued .
chris martin said before the album 's release he felt he was " about to be fed to the lions " and he later walked out of a bbc interview as he was " not really enjoying this " .
the record 's title track gave the band their first uk number one single , however .

the band have also kept tight control over the use of their music , turning down huge sums of money for tracks to be used in adverts .
" we would n't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs ' meanings like that " said martin .
after a frantic few years , the band retreated during 2003 , staying out of the spotlight and working on the next album .

all four of coldplay 's albums have debuted at number one in the uk the album , which has hit number one in more than 30 countries , has cemented the band 's reputation as a global phenomenon .
it has been named best rock album by the us recording academy , and coldplay went on to an award hat-trick including the coveted song of the year for viva la vida .
it is nine years since their first record , parachutes , debuted at the top of the charts .
lead single yellow became the summer 's anthem and , to top it all , the album received a mercury music prize nomination .
despite , or perhaps because of , their seemingly effortless success , the critical reaction to coldplay has always been mixed , and it has proved hard for them to shake an early description of their sound as " bedwetters ' music " .
nice guys the comment came from alan mcgee , the former creation label boss who discovered oasis .
he went on , " if coldplay have an attitude about anything , it 's passing their a-levels " .
it summed up the view that the group were just too middle class to rock .
indeed , the group formed at the distinctly not edgy university college , london .
frontman chris martin began on piano and vocals , though he has since branched out onto the mandolin and harmonica .
jonny buckland plays guitar , guy berryman bass and will champion drums .
martin 's school friend phil harvey , who was studying classics at oxford , was brought in as manager and the band still see him as their fifth member .
the more people that like us , the more people seem to hate us chris martin , 2001 early interviewers made frequent mention of the band 's educated backgrounds and the fact the lead singer did n't drink or eat meat , painting a picture of them as the nice guys of rock .
this was helped along by the band themselves , who shunned the trappings of rock and roll .
berryman said at the time : " we 're a band who like to keep ourselves to ourselves .
we do n't want to be in the gossip columns or be seen at film premieres with the latest celebrity girlfriend . "
" we want people to know us for our music - and only for our music - and not who we go out with . "
ironic , given that chris martin was later to draw tabloid attention for his relationship with , and eventual marriage to , hollywood actress gwyneth paltrow .
acclaim the fans did n't care about the image , though .
around 10,000 of them turned out for a mid-afternoon glastonbury set in 2000 .
but chris martin found the extremes of public acclaim and press criticism unsettling .
" the more people that like us , the more people seem to hate us , and it 's something nobody tells you how to deal with , " he said .
" we want to make one more record and try to make it the best record ever made , and then retire .
" i 'll become a busker , i think .

jazz composer simon thorne was given the task of creating the " soundscape " to provide a musical backdrop to some of the ancient exhibits on display .
the musician says the work is " probably the most unusual " he has undertaken .
there has been strong interest in the composition and it will go on a separate live tour later in the year .
neanderthal man existed side by side with early homo sapiens before becoming extinct some 30,000 years ago .
despite having a reputation for lacking intelligence , recent research suggests the neanderthals were a lot more resourceful and innovative than was first thought .
thorne said : " given that neanderthal 's man brain was about the same size as ours , and much of our brain is given over to language , then you can assume they probably had language too .
" every culture has language and music , so we can probably assume that they had some kind of music too . "
his 75-minute composition was commissioned by national museum wales to provide a musical illustration for the palaeolithic section of its exhibition origins of early wales .
the exhibition includes artefacts like a neanderthal hand axe and teeth found at pontnewydd in denbighshire and , as part of his research , cardiff-based mr thorne visited the cave where they were found .
he said he was the first to admit that knowing exactly what neanderthal music would have sounded like is impossible .
" it 's a ridiculous notion to suggest we could ever know the precise role that music played in the lives of the neanderthals , but imagining it has been a fascinating experience . "
the composer has also researched the era extensively and been inspired by two books - prof steven mithen 's the singing neanderthals and david lewis williams 's the mind in the cave .
prof mithen will be at the museum launch and , in conversation with mr thorne , will talk about the role music may have played in the lives of the neanderthals .
the reading university academic , whose research centres on the evolution of human language and musical ability , said thorne 's work was " a fantastic go at evoking the sense of prehistory of our human ancestry " .
he added : " he is trying to create the whole sense of being there at that time . "
instinctively creative as well as the music , a specially commissioned film will help transport those present into a neanderthal cave .
it will go on tour , complete with four singers , stone instruments and a video project to harlech , cardigan , milford haven and swansea at the end of march , and already mr thorne has had " great interest " in his experiment from the british museum .
he said the project had given him an insight into our own communication .
" we as human beings are instinctively creative , " he said .
" we ca n't not be - we have to invent things and who 's to say neanderthal man did not invent the beginnings of music ? "
" we use language for words , to communicate .
but how do we learn language ?
if you look at babies and the noise they make , they learn to make singing noises before they learn to speak . "

you have been telling us what conditions are like in melbourne and other towns in affected by the fires .
your comments it 's like all hell 's broken loose tonight .
it 's just a mass confusion , and to make matters worse , it seems that the mobile phone networks are down .
i 'm lucky - i 'm not in a high-risk area , but i know people who are in danger , and i ca n't get in contact with them .
jamie , melbourne , australia it 's been a terrible day here .
the temperature has reached a record 46 degrees with gale force hot winds .
there are many fires and people have died .
friends have gotten into their dam to escape the fire .
this is much worse than the ash wednesday fires .
jo , melbourne , australia it 's hard to believe just how hot it was here today .
you can see the smoke in the air in melbourne , it 's a shade of brown .
my heart goes out to all those who 've suffered .
simon , melbourne , australia its 11.30pm , i 've just gone to bed , and all i 've been able to smell is wood burning for the last five hours !
dave haywood , seville , melbourne police believe that deaths may be in the 40s , once all are counted .
some of the fires are still spreading as we approach midnight .
even those of us sandwiched between relatively quiescent fires do n't dare go to bed yet .
erik christiansen , melbourne , australia these fires send a chill up my spine .
i grew up in bushfire country 30 kilometres out of melbourne .
i still remember in 1962-3 the raging flames jumping the river and tearing up the hill - our neighbours ' house went but dad somehow saved ours .
we got out just in time but we never ever again saw kangaroos in our backyard .
they were wiped out for good .
i was five years old then and every summer thereafter we 'd wait with foreboding to hear the sirens and smell the unmistakable smoke in the distance .
mother nature at her fiercest .
god bless the firefighters and volunteers !
ralph davidsom , ex melbourne what an amazing contrast at this point in time to the northern hemisphere .
its difficult to describe a city engulfed in 47 degree temperatures , 80 kilometres per hour wind that is literally so hot it makes it difficult to even breath .
and as a result , a state now ravaged by fire , with now tragically confirmed 14 deaths , and merely brave souls defending their properties .
our thoughts are with the valiant firefighters currently fighting these fires , and hope that will be dealt with as expediently as humanly possible .
indeed a very humbling experience witnessing nature at its most extreme .
adam haines , melbourne the smell of smoke is very strong , although we are lucky to not be directly affected .
my brother in yarra glen spent the day mopping burning embers as they landed from a fire several kilometres away .
local news agencies are reporting more than 5000 hectares -lrb- 12,500 acres -rrb- are burnt , many houses .
our thermometer read 47.8 degrees c at 4pm .
the blast of hot wind that hit when we went outside was like that felt when you open an oven door and the grass crunched underfoot like breakfast cereal .
thank goodness for the cfa -lrb- country fire authority -rrb- - thousands of those brave volunteers headed out into the heat to fight fires today , and many will be working on through the night .
tomorrow should be cooler - let 's also hope for some much needed rain .
linda , kyabram , victoria , australia i live in the city of melbourne and the heat today has been unbearable .
the sky has been very cloudy and smoky all day giving an eerie orange glow .
the winds have been extremely high and i ca n't imagine how terrifying it must be for the volunteer firefighters standing face to face with these 10 metre flames .
footage of the flames moving up hills at what looks like 100 kilometres an hour is just frightening .
my thoughts are with those who have lost their homes , loved ones , and those still fighting to save their homes .
sarah putnam , melbourne , australia it has been a scary day and the fires continue to rage well into the night .
just because we live in a big city does not protect us from the elements .
australia is a tough country to live in .
we have had no rain for 8 weeks and that is why so much is burning .
our garden is burnt brown by the sun .
leaves are just frying in the heat .
this though is nothing when you see the extent of the fires .
we all feel for those directly affected by the fire storm .
we hear that you have cold weather .
please send some .
alison blakeley , melbourne australia we 've had over 46 c here today , so it 's been stifling all day .
compounding this has been the storm-force winds that were blowing all day .
we had a cool change blow in this afternoon -lrb- from 46 c down to 33 c in 15 minutes -rrb- but the strong winds expected with it have not eventuated yet , which i believe has worked with the fire 20 kms to the north of us , to burn it back into itself .
unfortunately , with any winds that do come , it means that the fires will start to move and be a danger to communities again .
now , we 're just sitting and waiting for the strong sw winds to come through and blow the heat away .
liz aitken , kyneton , victoria , australia you can not imagine the conditions today - over 46 c and winds around 60 km / h .
we live in the north east of melbourne about 40 km from the deadly fires in kinglake .
the sky was red and dark all day from a mix of the red dust which came with the hot winds from the hot centre of australia and the smoke from the fires .
the areas that are burning are some of the most beautiful areas of victoria .
the areas are very hilly and towns like kinglake -lrb- which has been wiped out -rrb- are only reachable via winding smaller roads up the hills which are being cut off by the fires and therefore very difficult to reach .
seeing some of the pics on local tv , the conditions are very much like the firestorms in the bombed cities in europe during ww2 .
it is all very sad .
the weather change has arrived and the temperature fallen below 30c but with the wind change it wont help much - we need rain .
everything is so dry and many areas have no water to fight the blazes .
i expect more fatalities .

footage of the flames moving up hills at what looks like 100 kilometres an hour is just frightening .
my thoughts are with those who have lost their homes , loved ones , and those still fighting to save their homes .
sarah putnam , melbourne , australia it has been a scary day and the fires continue to rage well into the night .
just because we live in a big city does not protect us from the elements .
australia is a tough country to live in .
we have had no rain for 8 weeks and that is why so much is burning .
our garden is burnt brown by the sun .
leaves are just frying in the heat .
this though is nothing when you see the extent of the fires .
we all feel for those directly affected by the fire storm .
we hear that you have cold weather .
please send some .
alison blakeley , melbourne australia we 've had over 46 c here today , so it 's been stifling all day .
compounding this has been the storm-force winds that were blowing all day .
we had a cool change blow in this afternoon -lrb- from 46 c down to 33 c in 15 minutes -rrb- but the strong winds expected with it have not eventuated yet , which i believe has worked with the fire 20 kms to the north of us , to burn it back into itself .
unfortunately , with any winds that do come , it means that the fires will start to move and be a danger to communities again .
now , we 're just sitting and waiting for the strong sw winds to come through and blow the heat away .
liz aitken , kyneton , victoria , australia you can not imagine the conditions today - over 46 c and winds around 60 km / h .
we live in the north east of melbourne about 40 km from the deadly fires in kinglake .
the sky was red and dark all day from a mix of the red dust which came with the hot winds from the hot centre of australia and the smoke from the fires .
the areas that are burning are some of the most beautiful areas of victoria .
the areas are very hilly and towns like kinglake -lrb- which has been wiped out -rrb- are only reachable via winding smaller roads up the hills which are being cut off by the fires and therefore very difficult to reach .
seeing some of the pics on local tv , the conditions are very much like the firestorms in the bombed cities in europe during ww2 .
it is all very sad .
the weather change has arrived and the temperature fallen below 30c but with the wind change it wont help much - we need rain .
everything is so dry and many areas have no water to fight the blazes .
i expect more fatalities .

you have been telling us what conditions are like in melbourne and other towns in affected by the fires .
your comments it 's like all hell 's broken loose tonight .
it 's just a mass confusion , and to make matters worse , it seems that the mobile phone networks are down .
i 'm lucky - i 'm not in a high-risk area , but i know people who are in danger , and i ca n't get in contact with them .
jamie , melbourne , australia it 's been a terrible day here .
the temperature has reached a record 46 degrees with gale force hot winds .
there are many fires and people have died .
friends have gotten into their dam to escape the fire .
this is much worse than the ash wednesday fires .
jo , melbourne , australia it 's hard to believe just how hot it was here today .
you can see the smoke in the air in melbourne , it 's a shade of brown .
my heart goes out to all those who 've suffered .
simon , melbourne , australia its 11.30pm , i 've just gone to bed , and all i 've been able to smell is wood burning for the last five hours !
dave haywood , seville , melbourne police believe that deaths may be in the 40s , once all are counted .
some of the fires are still spreading as we approach midnight .
even those of us sandwiched between relatively quiescent fires do n't dare go to bed yet .
erik christiansen , melbourne , australia these fires send a chill up my spine .
i grew up in bushfire country 30 kilometres out of melbourne .
i still remember in 1962-3 the raging flames jumping the river and tearing up the hill - our neighbours ' house went but dad somehow saved ours .
we got out just in time but we never ever again saw kangaroos in our backyard .
they were wiped out for good .
i was five years old then and every summer thereafter we 'd wait with foreboding to hear the sirens and smell the unmistakable smoke in the distance .
mother nature at her fiercest .
god bless the firefighters and volunteers !
ralph davidsom , ex melbourne what an amazing contrast at this point in time to the northern hemisphere .
its difficult to describe a city engulfed in 47 degree temperatures , 80 kilometres per hour wind that is literally so hot it makes it difficult to even breath .
and as a result , a state now ravaged by fire , with now tragically confirmed 14 deaths , and merely brave souls defending their properties .
our thoughts are with the valiant firefighters currently fighting these fires , and hope that will be dealt with as expediently as humanly possible .
indeed a very humbling experience witnessing nature at its most extreme .
adam haines , melbourne the smell of smoke is very strong , although we are lucky to not be directly affected .
my brother in yarra glen spent the day mopping burning embers as they landed from a fire several kilometres away .
local news agencies are reporting more than 5000 hectares -lrb- 12,500 acres -rrb- are burnt , many houses .
our thermometer read 47.8 degrees c at 4pm .
the blast of hot wind that hit when we went outside was like that felt when you open an oven door and the grass crunched underfoot like breakfast cereal .
thank goodness for the cfa -lrb- country fire authority -rrb- - thousands of those brave volunteers headed out into the heat to fight fires today , and many will be working on through the night .
tomorrow should be cooler - let 's also hope for some much needed rain .
linda , kyabram , victoria , australia i live in the city of melbourne and the heat today has been unbearable .

you have been telling us what conditions are like in melbourne and other towns in affected by the fires .
your comments it 's like all hell 's broken loose tonight .
it 's just a mass confusion , and to make matters worse , it seems that the mobile phone networks are down .
i 'm lucky - i 'm not in a high-risk area , but i know people who are in danger , and i ca n't get in contact with them .
jamie , melbourne , australia it 's been a terrible day here .
the temperature has reached a record 46 degrees with gale force hot winds .
there are many fires and people have died .
friends have gotten into their dam to escape the fire .
this is much worse than the ash wednesday fires .
jo , melbourne , australia it 's hard to believe just how hot it was here today .
you can see the smoke in the air in melbourne , it 's a shade of brown .
my heart goes out to all those who 've suffered .
simon , melbourne , australia its 11.30pm , i 've just gone to bed , and all i 've been able to smell is wood burning for the last five hours !
dave haywood , seville , melbourne police believe that deaths may be in the 40s , once all are counted .
some of the fires are still spreading as we approach midnight .
even those of us sandwiched between relatively quiescent fires do n't dare go to bed yet .
erik christiansen , melbourne , australia these fires send a chill up my spine .
i grew up in bushfire country 30 kilometres out of melbourne .
i still remember in 1962-3 the raging flames jumping the river and tearing up the hill - our neighbours ' house went but dad somehow saved ours .
we got out just in time but we never ever again saw kangaroos in our backyard .
they were wiped out for good .
i was five years old then and every summer thereafter we 'd wait with foreboding to hear the sirens and smell the unmistakable smoke in the distance .
mother nature at her fiercest .
god bless the firefighters and volunteers !
ralph davidsom , ex melbourne what an amazing contrast at this point in time to the northern hemisphere .
its difficult to describe a city engulfed in 47 degree temperatures , 80 kilometres per hour wind that is literally so hot it makes it difficult to even breath .
and as a result , a state now ravaged by fire , with now tragically confirmed 14 deaths , and merely brave souls defending their properties .
our thoughts are with the valiant firefighters currently fighting these fires , and hope that will be dealt with as expediently as humanly possible .
indeed a very humbling experience witnessing nature at its most extreme .
adam haines , melbourne the smell of smoke is very strong , although we are lucky to not be directly affected .
my brother in yarra glen spent the day mopping burning embers as they landed from a fire several kilometres away .
local news agencies are reporting more than 5000 hectares -lrb- 12,500 acres -rrb- are burnt , many houses .
our thermometer read 47.8 degrees c at 4pm .
the blast of hot wind that hit when we went outside was like that felt when you open an oven door and the grass crunched underfoot like breakfast cereal .
thank goodness for the cfa -lrb- country fire authority -rrb- - thousands of those brave volunteers headed out into the heat to fight fires today , and many will be working on through the night .
tomorrow should be cooler - let 's also hope for some much needed rain .
linda , kyabram , victoria , australia i live in the city of melbourne and the heat today has been unbearable .
the sky has been very cloudy and smoky all day giving an eerie orange glow .
the winds have been extremely high and i ca n't imagine how terrifying it must be for the volunteer firefighters standing face to face with these 10 metre flames .
footage of the flames moving up hills at what looks like 100 kilometres an hour is just frightening .
my thoughts are with those who have lost their homes , loved ones , and those still fighting to save their homes .
sarah putnam , melbourne , australia it has been a scary day and the fires continue to rage well into the night .
just because we live in a big city does not protect us from the elements .
australia is a tough country to live in .
we have had no rain for 8 weeks and that is why so much is burning .
our garden is burnt brown by the sun .
leaves are just frying in the heat .
this though is nothing when you see the extent of the fires .
we all feel for those directly affected by the fire storm .
we hear that you have cold weather .
please send some .
alison blakeley , melbourne australia we 've had over 46 c here today , so it 's been stifling all day .
compounding this has been the storm-force winds that were blowing all day .
we had a cool change blow in this afternoon -lrb- from 46 c down to 33 c in 15 minutes -rrb- but the strong winds expected with it have not eventuated yet , which i believe has worked with the fire 20 kms to the north of us , to burn it back into itself .
unfortunately , with any winds that do come , it means that the fires will start to move and be a danger to communities again .
now , we 're just sitting and waiting for the strong sw winds to come through and blow the heat away .
liz aitken , kyneton , victoria , australia you can not imagine the conditions today - over 46 c and winds around 60 km / h .
we live in the north east of melbourne about 40 km from the deadly fires in kinglake .
the sky was red and dark all day from a mix of the red dust which came with the hot winds from the hot centre of australia and the smoke from the fires .
the areas that are burning are some of the most beautiful areas of victoria .
the areas are very hilly and towns like kinglake -lrb- which has been wiped out -rrb- are only reachable via winding smaller roads up the hills which are being cut off by the fires and therefore very difficult to reach .
seeing some of the pics on local tv , the conditions are very much like the firestorms in the bombed cities in europe during ww2 .
it is all very sad .
the weather change has arrived and the temperature fallen below 30c but with the wind change it wont help much - we need rain .
everything is so dry and many areas have no water to fight the blazes .
i expect more fatalities .
