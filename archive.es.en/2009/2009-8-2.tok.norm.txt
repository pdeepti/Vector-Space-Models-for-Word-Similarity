for a small fee they can get off the beaten path by stepping onto a bus that stops at contemporary art sites . for five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- , contemporary art aficionados can bypass the stress of driving in a foreign city and be chauffeured on the " art bus " to some of paris ' more hidden or hard-to-get-to contemporary art spaces and centers . " the idea is to show them places where maybe they wouldn ’ t go by themselves , " said selma toprak of the paris contemporary art network , the non-profit organization which operates the tour . " it helps visitors to find contemporary art that exists beyond the walls of well-known art galleries , museums and art spaces listed in most paris city guide books . " the tours also allow people to meet and speak with the directors of galleries or artists themselves . each month the bus visits different art locations , such as an open house of the national fine arts school to see works by recent graduates or the domaine de chamarande , a contemporary art museum in a 17th-century chateau an hour south of the city . the artistic director of the center , judith quentel , takes tour groups through the chateau grounds , explaining the history of the site , and conducting private tours of the permanent exhibitions . the current exhibit is called " au pied de la lettre , " a french idiomatic expression that means taking words at face value .
all of the works in the exhibition have something to do with the written word . personal service it is the personal service and detailed explanations that attract art lovers to the service .
nicole baatz said it 's particularly valuable that those on the tour get to meet the artists in person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour stops at exhibitions and galleries off the main tourist route " that ’ s very interesting because normally , you don ’ t get to see the artists , " said nicole baatz .
" and you learn so much more than if you visited the place on your own . " the domaine de chamarande is located more than 40 kilometers outside of paris and it is often hard for them to lure people from the city .
artistic director judith quentel thinks the art bus solves that problem for them . the taxi-tram " allows cultural sites located on the periphery of the capital , which are of equal artistic quality , to exist , " said quentel .
" it also brings visitors here for the first time who may then come again . " the monthly taxi-tram visits are becoming so popular that there are never vacant seats .
starting next year , the tours will take place every weekend . author : genevieve oger -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 02.08.2009 mixed progress report for un 's ban ki-moon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon has to focus more on results , say experts with ban ki-moon having reached the halfway mark of his first term as un secretary-general , experts point to some successes , but also argue that there is a lot of room for improvement . when ban ki-moon took over the position of what has been called the world 's top diplomat in january 2007 , he had large shoes to fill .
his predecessor kofi annan - while not being very popular with the bush administration - was generally highly regarded around the world during his tenure .
in fact , his international popularity was enhanced due to his frequent public disagreements with washington . all that changed when former south korean diplomat ban began his five-year term at the united nations .
not only did ban enjoy the full support of the united states - still the un 's most important stakeholder - but the tone and style of the rhetoric coming out of un headquarters in new york also changed . from the start of his tenure much has been written about ban 's style of speaking and his public perception - a lot of it negative .
ban himself has never claimed to be a great orator but maintains that substance trumps perception . so now that he has passed the half-way mark of his first term as un secretary-general , how has ban and the united nations been faring with an approach that differs markedly from that of his predecessor ? while some critics have condemned ban as a total failure and ridiculed him as the invisible man , the experts deutsche welle talked to have a more nuanced take on the un chief . " those who call him an abject failure are certainly wrong , because they misread the challenges he was up to .
but those who simply defend him , and say that he has done a good job and no improvement is necessary are also wrong " , says thorsten benner , a un expert and associate director of berlin 's global public policy institute .
" i think his record so far is mixed . " tough job that applies to all roles ban has to play as secretary-general , namely being the world 's top diplomat , the ceo of the world 's most troubled bureaucracy and the world 's conscience , adds benner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban wants to reform the un 's bureaucracy kara mcdonald , former director for un affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush and now international affairs fellow in residence at the council on foreign relations , agrees . " i would certainly not call him an abject failure .
i think a lot of those analyses do n't take into account the realism of the job and what he is facing .
the post is one of the toughest jobs in the world .
it 's one that you would n't wish upon your worst enemy , " she says . as for ban 's biggest achievements so far , both experts say that the secretary-general has tried to push climate change to the forefront of the global agenda , also with specific countries , such as the united states and china , which have been reluctant until recently to take action on the issue . another area where ban tried to make his mark early on has been reforms to the un 's notorious bureaucracy . losing steam benner and mcdonald praise him for raising the issue , but both point out that the initiative quickly lost steam . " he has been pushing for this , but his leadership style has n't been conducive at all to get others to follow him " , says benner .
" he has given the impression that he surrounds himself with a coterie of korean advisers on the 38th floor -lrb- of the un building in new york -rrb- , and by and large the staff of the un secretariat have been unwilling to follow him . " ban 's advocacy on climate change has been hampered by similar setbacks , says benner . " due to his very toned-down style and his not very forceful rhetoric not many have noticed his activism on that front , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban during his disappointing trip to burma while benner said ban must rethink his style but not necessarily the messages themselves , mcdonald does n't see the secretary-general 's public rhetoric and profile as the main problem . " i personally am less concerned about profile than i am about results and occupation with legacy and re-election over the day-to-day operation of the united nations , " she said . " i think on the latter score , ban has delegated a substantial amount of authority to his inner circle and to ambassador kim , who is his deputy chief-of-staff , in particular , and there has been some criticism of that delegation line and of his inner circle . " results matter on a very practical level , ban needs to re-evaluate his agenda and priorities , argued mcdonald , citing his most recent trip to burma from where he returned largely empty-handed . " the broader issue of engaging and travelling to countries without a sense of clear results beforehand has harmed the secretary-general , " she said . what 's more , added mcdonald , any secretary-general must be ready to break some china . " it 's simply not possible to keep everyone happy in the un system , " she said . author : michael knigge editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fire fighters and the military are trying to bring the flames under control . the fires raged for the second day on sunday , devastating thousands of hectares of pine forest on the popular holiday island of la palma .
around 4,000 residents and tourists had to flee their homes and were moved into a temporary shelter .
around 30 homes and several wineries have been burned down .
some 500 firefighters , forest rangers and military personnel , including from neighboring islands , were called in to deal with the fires .
spanish air force planes and helicopters are also involved in efforts to bring the blaze under control .
the flames were fanned by strong winds and were spreading on several fronts while a fresh outbreak was detected on the smaller island of la gomera .
spain has seen temperatures soar to well over 30 degrees celsius .
the fire has struck at the height of the holiday season – the archipelago off the atlantic coast of northern africa entirely depends on tourism .
local authorities said they hoped to bring the blaze under control on sunday .

for a small fee they can get off the beaten path by stepping onto a bus that stops at contemporary art sites . for five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- , contemporary art aficionados can bypass the stress of driving in a foreign city and be chauffeured on the " art bus " to some of paris ' more hidden or hard-to-get-to contemporary art spaces and centers . " the idea is to show them places where maybe they wouldn ’ t go by themselves , " said selma toprak of the paris contemporary art network , the non-profit organization which operates the tour . " it helps visitors to find contemporary art that exists beyond the walls of well-known art galleries , museums and art spaces listed in most paris city guide books . " the tours also allow people to meet and speak with the directors of galleries or artists themselves . each month the bus visits different art locations , such as an open house of the national fine arts school to see works by recent graduates or the domaine de chamarande , a contemporary art museum in a 17th-century chateau an hour south of the city . the artistic director of the center , judith quentel , takes tour groups through the chateau grounds , explaining the history of the site , and conducting private tours of the permanent exhibitions . the current exhibit is called " au pied de la lettre , " a french idiomatic expression that means taking words at face value .
all of the works in the exhibition have something to do with the written word . personal service it is the personal service and detailed explanations that attract art lovers to the service .
nicole baatz said it 's particularly valuable that those on the tour get to meet the artists in person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour stops at exhibitions and galleries off the main tourist route " that ’ s very interesting because normally , you don ’ t get to see the artists , " said nicole baatz .
" and you learn so much more than if you visited the place on your own . " the domaine de chamarande is located more than 40 kilometers outside of paris and it is often hard for them to lure people from the city .
artistic director judith quentel thinks the art bus solves that problem for them . the taxi-tram " allows cultural sites located on the periphery of the capital , which are of equal artistic quality , to exist , " said quentel .
" it also brings visitors here for the first time who may then come again . " the monthly taxi-tram visits are becoming so popular that there are never vacant seats .
starting next year , the tours will take place every weekend . author : genevieve oger -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his predecessor kofi annan - while not being very popular with the bush administration - was generally highly regarded around the world during his tenure .
in fact , his international popularity was enhanced due to his frequent public disagreements with washington . all that changed when former south korean diplomat ban began his five-year term at the united nations .
not only did ban enjoy the full support of the united states - still the un 's most important stakeholder - but the tone and style of the rhetoric coming out of un headquarters in new york also changed . from the start of his tenure much has been written about ban 's style of speaking and his public perception - a lot of it negative .
ban himself has never claimed to be a great orator but maintains that substance trumps perception . so now that he has passed the half-way mark of his first term as un secretary-general , how has ban and the united nations been faring with an approach that differs markedly from that of his predecessor ? while some critics have condemned ban as a total failure and ridiculed him as the invisible man , the experts deutsche welle talked to have a more nuanced take on the un chief . " those who call him an abject failure are certainly wrong , because they misread the challenges he was up to .
but those who simply defend him , and say that he has done a good job and no improvement is necessary are also wrong " , says thorsten benner , a un expert and associate director of berlin 's global public policy institute .
" i think his record so far is mixed . " tough job that applies to all roles ban has to play as secretary-general , namely being the world 's top diplomat , the ceo of the world 's most troubled bureaucracy and the world 's conscience , adds benner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban wants to reform the un 's bureaucracy kara mcdonald , former director for un affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush and now international affairs fellow in residence at the council on foreign relations , agrees . " i would certainly not call him an abject failure .
i think a lot of those analyses do n't take into account the realism of the job and what he is facing .
the post is one of the toughest jobs in the world .
it 's one that you would n't wish upon your worst enemy , " she says . as for ban 's biggest achievements so far , both experts say that the secretary-general has tried to push climate change to the forefront of the global agenda , also with specific countries , such as the united states and china , which have been reluctant until recently to take action on the issue . another area where ban tried to make his mark early on has been reforms to the un 's notorious bureaucracy . losing steam benner and mcdonald praise him for raising the issue , but both point out that the initiative quickly lost steam . " he has been pushing for this , but his leadership style has n't been conducive at all to get others to follow him " , says benner .
" he has given the impression that he surrounds himself with a coterie of korean advisers on the 38th floor -lrb- of the un building in new york -rrb- , and by and large the staff of the un secretariat have been unwilling to follow him . " ban 's advocacy on climate change has been hampered by similar setbacks , says benner . " due to his very toned-down style and his not very forceful rhetoric not many have noticed his activism on that front , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban during his disappointing trip to burma while benner said ban must rethink his style but not necessarily the messages themselves , mcdonald does n't see the secretary-general 's public rhetoric and profile as the main problem . " i personally am less concerned about profile than i am about results and occupation with legacy and re-election over the day-to-day operation of the united nations , " she said . " i think on the latter score , ban has delegated a substantial amount of authority to his inner circle and to ambassador kim , who is his deputy chief-of-staff , in particular , and there has been some criticism of that delegation line and of his inner circle . " results matter on a very practical level , ban needs to re-evaluate his agenda and priorities , argued mcdonald , citing his most recent trip to burma from where he returned largely empty-handed . " the broader issue of engaging and travelling to countries without a sense of clear results beforehand has harmed the secretary-general , " she said . what 's more , added mcdonald , any secretary-general must be ready to break some china . " it 's simply not possible to keep everyone happy in the un system , " she said . author : michael knigge editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

" in a statement on sunday , steinmeier expressed concerns about the trial of more than 100 people accused of violence during mass demonstrations following disputed elections in june .
" the reports about the beginning of the trial of members of the opposition in iran deeply concern us , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is deeply concerned by the trial " the iranian government is called on to release the political prisoners and respect international standards for the protection of civil and political rights of its citizens to which it has agreed . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday in iran , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy against the government .
berlin is " deeply concerned " steinmeier said the government in berlin had reason to believe the people brought before a revolutionary court in tehran would not have a " transparent or fair trial . "
leading moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of the current president .
the authorities deny the charge accusing the west of instigating the protests .
at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
" the exact number of political prisoners in prison who were arrested after the disputed presidential election on june 12 is unknown but their number is estimated at several hundred , " steinmeier said .

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 02.08.2009 mixed progress report for un 's ban ki-moon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon has to focus more on results , say experts with ban ki-moon having reached the halfway mark of his first term as un secretary-general , experts point to some successes , but also argue that there is a lot of room for improvement . when ban ki-moon took over the position of what has been called the world 's top diplomat in january 2007 , he had large shoes to fill .
his predecessor kofi annan - while not being very popular with the bush administration - was generally highly regarded around the world during his tenure .
in fact , his international popularity was enhanced due to his frequent public disagreements with washington . all that changed when former south korean diplomat ban began his five-year term at the united nations .
not only did ban enjoy the full support of the united states - still the un 's most important stakeholder - but the tone and style of the rhetoric coming out of un headquarters in new york also changed . from the start of his tenure much has been written about ban 's style of speaking and his public perception - a lot of it negative .
ban himself has never claimed to be a great orator but maintains that substance trumps perception . so now that he has passed the half-way mark of his first term as un secretary-general , how has ban and the united nations been faring with an approach that differs markedly from that of his predecessor ? while some critics have condemned ban as a total failure and ridiculed him as the invisible man , the experts deutsche welle talked to have a more nuanced take on the un chief . " those who call him an abject failure are certainly wrong , because they misread the challenges he was up to .
but those who simply defend him , and say that he has done a good job and no improvement is necessary are also wrong " , says thorsten benner , a un expert and associate director of berlin 's global public policy institute .
" i think his record so far is mixed . " tough job that applies to all roles ban has to play as secretary-general , namely being the world 's top diplomat , the ceo of the world 's most troubled bureaucracy and the world 's conscience , adds benner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban wants to reform the un 's bureaucracy kara mcdonald , former director for un affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush and now international affairs fellow in residence at the council on foreign relations , agrees . " i would certainly not call him an abject failure .
i think a lot of those analyses do n't take into account the realism of the job and what he is facing .
the post is one of the toughest jobs in the world .
it 's one that you would n't wish upon your worst enemy , " she says . as for ban 's biggest achievements so far , both experts say that the secretary-general has tried to push climate change to the forefront of the global agenda , also with specific countries , such as the united states and china , which have been reluctant until recently to take action on the issue . another area where ban tried to make his mark early on has been reforms to the un 's notorious bureaucracy . losing steam benner and mcdonald praise him for raising the issue , but both point out that the initiative quickly lost steam . " he has been pushing for this , but his leadership style has n't been conducive at all to get others to follow him " , says benner .
" he has given the impression that he surrounds himself with a coterie of korean advisers on the 38th floor -lrb- of the un building in new york -rrb- , and by and large the staff of the un secretariat have been unwilling to follow him . " ban 's advocacy on climate change has been hampered by similar setbacks , says benner . " due to his very toned-down style and his not very forceful rhetoric not many have noticed his activism on that front , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban during his disappointing trip to burma while benner said ban must rethink his style but not necessarily the messages themselves , mcdonald does n't see the secretary-general 's public rhetoric and profile as the main problem . " i personally am less concerned about profile than i am about results and occupation with legacy and re-election over the day-to-day operation of the united nations , " she said . " i think on the latter score , ban has delegated a substantial amount of authority to his inner circle and to ambassador kim , who is his deputy chief-of-staff , in particular , and there has been some criticism of that delegation line and of his inner circle . " results matter on a very practical level , ban needs to re-evaluate his agenda and priorities , argued mcdonald , citing his most recent trip to burma from where he returned largely empty-handed . " the broader issue of engaging and travelling to countries without a sense of clear results beforehand has harmed the secretary-general , " she said . what 's more , added mcdonald , any secretary-general must be ready to break some china . " it 's simply not possible to keep everyone happy in the un system , " she said . author : michael knigge editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for a small fee they can get off the beaten path by stepping onto a bus that stops at contemporary art sites . for five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- , contemporary art aficionados can bypass the stress of driving in a foreign city and be chauffeured on the " art bus " to some of paris ' more hidden or hard-to-get-to contemporary art spaces and centers . " the idea is to show them places where maybe they wouldn ’ t go by themselves , " said selma toprak of the paris contemporary art network , the non-profit organization which operates the tour . " it helps visitors to find contemporary art that exists beyond the walls of well-known art galleries , museums and art spaces listed in most paris city guide books . " the tours also allow people to meet and speak with the directors of galleries or artists themselves . each month the bus visits different art locations , such as an open house of the national fine arts school to see works by recent graduates or the domaine de chamarande , a contemporary art museum in a 17th-century chateau an hour south of the city . the artistic director of the center , judith quentel , takes tour groups through the chateau grounds , explaining the history of the site , and conducting private tours of the permanent exhibitions . the current exhibit is called " au pied de la lettre , " a french idiomatic expression that means taking words at face value .
all of the works in the exhibition have something to do with the written word . personal service it is the personal service and detailed explanations that attract art lovers to the service .
nicole baatz said it 's particularly valuable that those on the tour get to meet the artists in person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour stops at exhibitions and galleries off the main tourist route " that ’ s very interesting because normally , you don ’ t get to see the artists , " said nicole baatz .
" and you learn so much more than if you visited the place on your own . " the domaine de chamarande is located more than 40 kilometers outside of paris and it is often hard for them to lure people from the city .
artistic director judith quentel thinks the art bus solves that problem for them . the taxi-tram " allows cultural sites located on the periphery of the capital , which are of equal artistic quality , to exist , " said quentel .
" it also brings visitors here for the first time who may then come again . " the monthly taxi-tram visits are becoming so popular that there are never vacant seats .
starting next year , the tours will take place every weekend . author : genevieve oger -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with german newspaper neuen osnabruecker zeitung , leinen said the bloc was no longer ruling out a sharp hike in the number of swine flu deaths .
the virus has so far killed a total of around 40 people in eu nations belgium , britain , france , hungary and spain .
brussels is trying to harmonize efforts , to better respond to the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus which first surfaced in mexico and has killed more than 800 people around the globe .
germany and italy plan to vaccinate roughly a third of their populations while greece became the first european country to announce it was planning to immunize its entire population of 11 million .
official slams slow vaccine production but on saturday , leinen , a member of the german social democratic party , criticized the slow pace of vaccine production in europe .
he said around 150 million europeans needed to be vaccinated against the virus .
leinen pointed out that only a few pharmaceutical companies in germany , france and britain could produce the vaccines .
at the same time , poorer eu countries hard hit by the global recession can not afford to pay for sufficient doses , he said .
" the swine flu virus is going to test solidarity among eu members .
we need to show it , " leinen said , adding : " we really need a vaccine as soon as possible . "
on friday , eu health officials said they were working on drawing up a common strategy to confront swine flu before children return to school in september , increasing the risk the illness will spread. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 02.08.2009 mixed progress report for un 's ban ki-moon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban ki-moon has to focus more on results , say experts with ban ki-moon having reached the halfway mark of his first term as un secretary-general , experts point to some successes , but also argue that there is a lot of room for improvement . when ban ki-moon took over the position of what has been called the world 's top diplomat in january 2007 , he had large shoes to fill .
his predecessor kofi annan - while not being very popular with the bush administration - was generally highly regarded around the world during his tenure .
in fact , his international popularity was enhanced due to his frequent public disagreements with washington . all that changed when former south korean diplomat ban began his five-year term at the united nations .
not only did ban enjoy the full support of the united states - still the un 's most important stakeholder - but the tone and style of the rhetoric coming out of un headquarters in new york also changed . from the start of his tenure much has been written about ban 's style of speaking and his public perception - a lot of it negative .
ban himself has never claimed to be a great orator but maintains that substance trumps perception . so now that he has passed the half-way mark of his first term as un secretary-general , how has ban and the united nations been faring with an approach that differs markedly from that of his predecessor ? while some critics have condemned ban as a total failure and ridiculed him as the invisible man , the experts deutsche welle talked to have a more nuanced take on the un chief . " those who call him an abject failure are certainly wrong , because they misread the challenges he was up to .
but those who simply defend him , and say that he has done a good job and no improvement is necessary are also wrong " , says thorsten benner , a un expert and associate director of berlin 's global public policy institute .
" i think his record so far is mixed . " tough job that applies to all roles ban has to play as secretary-general , namely being the world 's top diplomat , the ceo of the world 's most troubled bureaucracy and the world 's conscience , adds benner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban wants to reform the un 's bureaucracy kara mcdonald , former director for un affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush and now international affairs fellow in residence at the council on foreign relations , agrees . " i would certainly not call him an abject failure .
i think a lot of those analyses do n't take into account the realism of the job and what he is facing .
the post is one of the toughest jobs in the world .
it 's one that you would n't wish upon your worst enemy , " she says . as for ban 's biggest achievements so far , both experts say that the secretary-general has tried to push climate change to the forefront of the global agenda , also with specific countries , such as the united states and china , which have been reluctant until recently to take action on the issue . another area where ban tried to make his mark early on has been reforms to the un 's notorious bureaucracy . losing steam benner and mcdonald praise him for raising the issue , but both point out that the initiative quickly lost steam . " he has been pushing for this , but his leadership style has n't been conducive at all to get others to follow him " , says benner .
" he has given the impression that he surrounds himself with a coterie of korean advisers on the 38th floor -lrb- of the un building in new york -rrb- , and by and large the staff of the un secretariat have been unwilling to follow him . " ban 's advocacy on climate change has been hampered by similar setbacks , says benner . " due to his very toned-down style and his not very forceful rhetoric not many have noticed his activism on that front , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban during his disappointing trip to burma while benner said ban must rethink his style but not necessarily the messages themselves , mcdonald does n't see the secretary-general 's public rhetoric and profile as the main problem . " i personally am less concerned about profile than i am about results and occupation with legacy and re-election over the day-to-day operation of the united nations , " she said . " i think on the latter score , ban has delegated a substantial amount of authority to his inner circle and to ambassador kim , who is his deputy chief-of-staff , in particular , and there has been some criticism of that delegation line and of his inner circle . " results matter on a very practical level , ban needs to re-evaluate his agenda and priorities , argued mcdonald , citing his most recent trip to burma from where he returned largely empty-handed . " the broader issue of engaging and travelling to countries without a sense of clear results beforehand has harmed the secretary-general , " she said . what 's more , added mcdonald , any secretary-general must be ready to break some china . " it 's simply not possible to keep everyone happy in the un system , " she said . author : michael knigge editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fire fighters and the military are trying to bring the flames under control . the fires raged for the second day on sunday , devastating thousands of hectares of pine forest on the popular holiday island of la palma .
around 4,000 residents and tourists had to flee their homes and were moved into a temporary shelter .
around 30 homes and several wineries have been burned down .
some 500 firefighters , forest rangers and military personnel , including from neighboring islands , were called in to deal with the fires .
spanish air force planes and helicopters are also involved in efforts to bring the blaze under control .
the flames were fanned by strong winds and were spreading on several fronts while a fresh outbreak was detected on the smaller island of la gomera .
spain has seen temperatures soar to well over 30 degrees celsius .
the fire has struck at the height of the holiday season – the archipelago off the atlantic coast of northern africa entirely depends on tourism .
local authorities said they hoped to bring the blaze under control on sunday .
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is expected to fly to la palma later in the day to oversee efforts to tackle the fire .
since the the start of this year , at least eight people have been killed by fires in mainland spain .
fires have ravaged some 75,000 hectares of land , almost double the number as for the whole of 2008. ai / afp / ap / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for a small fee they can get off the beaten path by stepping onto a bus that stops at contemporary art sites . for five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- , contemporary art aficionados can bypass the stress of driving in a foreign city and be chauffeured on the " art bus " to some of paris ' more hidden or hard-to-get-to contemporary art spaces and centers . " the idea is to show them places where maybe they wouldn ’ t go by themselves , " said selma toprak of the paris contemporary art network , the non-profit organization which operates the tour . " it helps visitors to find contemporary art that exists beyond the walls of well-known art galleries , museums and art spaces listed in most paris city guide books . " the tours also allow people to meet and speak with the directors of galleries or artists themselves . each month the bus visits different art locations , such as an open house of the national fine arts school to see works by recent graduates or the domaine de chamarande , a contemporary art museum in a 17th-century chateau an hour south of the city . the artistic director of the center , judith quentel , takes tour groups through the chateau grounds , explaining the history of the site , and conducting private tours of the permanent exhibitions . the current exhibit is called " au pied de la lettre , " a french idiomatic expression that means taking words at face value .
all of the works in the exhibition have something to do with the written word . personal service it is the personal service and detailed explanations that attract art lovers to the service .
nicole baatz said it 's particularly valuable that those on the tour get to meet the artists in person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour stops at exhibitions and galleries off the main tourist route " that ’ s very interesting because normally , you don ’ t get to see the artists , " said nicole baatz .
" and you learn so much more than if you visited the place on your own . " the domaine de chamarande is located more than 40 kilometers outside of paris and it is often hard for them to lure people from the city .
artistic director judith quentel thinks the art bus solves that problem for them . the taxi-tram " allows cultural sites located on the periphery of the capital , which are of equal artistic quality , to exist , " said quentel .
" it also brings visitors here for the first time who may then come again . " the monthly taxi-tram visits are becoming so popular that there are never vacant seats .
starting next year , the tours will take place every weekend . author : genevieve oger -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

" in a statement on sunday , steinmeier expressed concerns about the trial of more than 100 people accused of violence during mass demonstrations following disputed elections in june .
" the reports about the beginning of the trial of members of the opposition in iran deeply concern us , " steinmeier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says germany is deeply concerned by the trial " the iranian government is called on to release the political prisoners and respect international standards for the protection of civil and political rights of its citizens to which it has agreed . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday in iran , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy against the government .
berlin is " deeply concerned " steinmeier said the government in berlin had reason to believe the people brought before a revolutionary court in tehran would not have a " transparent or fair trial . "
leading moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of the current president .
the authorities deny the charge accusing the west of instigating the protests .
at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

in an interview with german newspaper neuen osnabruecker zeitung , leinen said the bloc was no longer ruling out a sharp hike in the number of swine flu deaths .
the virus has so far killed a total of around 40 people in eu nations belgium , britain , france , hungary and spain .
brussels is trying to harmonize efforts , to better respond to the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus which first surfaced in mexico and has killed more than 800 people around the globe .
germany and italy plan to vaccinate roughly a third of their populations while greece became the first european country to announce it was planning to immunize its entire population of 11 million .
official slams slow vaccine production but on saturday , leinen , a member of the german social democratic party , criticized the slow pace of vaccine production in europe .
he said around 150 million europeans needed to be vaccinated against the virus .
leinen pointed out that only a few pharmaceutical companies in germany , france and britain could produce the vaccines .
at the same time , poorer eu countries hard hit by the global recession can not afford to pay for sufficient doses , he said .
" the swine flu virus is going to test solidarity among eu members .
we need to show it , " leinen said , adding : " we really need a vaccine as soon as possible . "
on friday , eu health officials said they were working on drawing up a common strategy to confront swine flu before children return to school in september , increasing the risk the illness will spread. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .

in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .

in an interview with german newspaper neuen osnabruecker zeitung , leinen said the bloc was no longer ruling out a sharp hike in the number of swine flu deaths .
the virus has so far killed a total of around 40 people in eu nations belgium , britain , france , hungary and spain .
brussels is trying to harmonize efforts , to better respond to the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus which first surfaced in mexico and has killed more than 800 people around the globe .
germany and italy plan to vaccinate roughly a third of their populations while greece became the first european country to announce it was planning to immunize its entire population of 11 million .
official slams slow vaccine production but on saturday , leinen , a member of the german social democratic party , criticized the slow pace of vaccine production in europe .
he said around 150 million europeans needed to be vaccinated against the virus .
leinen pointed out that only a few pharmaceutical companies in germany , france and britain could produce the vaccines .
at the same time , poorer eu countries hard hit by the global recession can not afford to pay for sufficient doses , he said .
" the swine flu virus is going to test solidarity among eu members .
we need to show it , " leinen said , adding : " we really need a vaccine as soon as possible . "
on friday , eu health officials said they were working on drawing up a common strategy to confront swine flu before children return to school in september , increasing the risk the illness will spread. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with german newspaper neuen osnabruecker zeitung , leinen said the bloc was no longer ruling out a sharp hike in the number of swine flu deaths .
the virus has so far killed a total of around 40 people in eu nations belgium , britain , france , hungary and spain .
brussels is trying to harmonize efforts , to better respond to the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus which first surfaced in mexico and has killed more than 800 people around the globe .
germany and italy plan to vaccinate roughly a third of their populations while greece became the first european country to announce it was planning to immunize its entire population of 11 million .
official slams slow vaccine production but on saturday , leinen , a member of the german social democratic party , criticized the slow pace of vaccine production in europe .
he said around 150 million europeans needed to be vaccinated against the virus .
leinen pointed out that only a few pharmaceutical companies in germany , france and britain could produce the vaccines .
at the same time , poorer eu countries hard hit by the global recession can not afford to pay for sufficient doses , he said .
" the swine flu virus is going to test solidarity among eu members .
we need to show it , " leinen said , adding : " we really need a vaccine as soon as possible . "
on friday , eu health officials said they were working on drawing up a common strategy to confront swine flu before children return to school in september , increasing the risk the illness will spread. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with german newspaper neuen osnabruecker zeitung , leinen said the bloc was no longer ruling out a sharp hike in the number of swine flu deaths .
the virus has so far killed a total of around 40 people in eu nations belgium , britain , france , hungary and spain .
brussels is trying to harmonize efforts , to better respond to the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus which first surfaced in mexico and has killed more than 800 people around the globe .
germany and italy plan to vaccinate roughly a third of their populations while greece became the first european country to announce it was planning to immunize its entire population of 11 million .
official slams slow vaccine production but on saturday , leinen , a member of the german social democratic party , criticized the slow pace of vaccine production in europe .
he said around 150 million europeans needed to be vaccinated against the virus .
leinen pointed out that only a few pharmaceutical companies in germany , france and britain could produce the vaccines .
at the same time , poorer eu countries hard hit by the global recession can not afford to pay for sufficient doses , he said .
" the swine flu virus is going to test solidarity among eu members .
we need to show it , " leinen said , adding : " we really need a vaccine as soon as possible . "
on friday , eu health officials said they were working on drawing up a common strategy to confront swine flu before children return to school in september , increasing the risk the illness will spread. sp / dpa / ap / afp editor : andy valvur send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

fire fighters and the military are trying to bring the flames under control . the fires raged for the second day on sunday , devastating thousands of hectares of pine forest on the popular holiday island of la palma .
around 4,000 residents and tourists had to flee their homes and were moved into a temporary shelter .
around 30 homes and several wineries have been burned down .
some 500 firefighters , forest rangers and military personnel , including from neighboring islands , were called in to deal with the fires .
spanish air force planes and helicopters are also involved in efforts to bring the blaze under control .
the flames were fanned by strong winds and were spreading on several fronts while a fresh outbreak was detected on the smaller island of la gomera .
spain has seen temperatures soar to well over 30 degrees celsius .
the fire has struck at the height of the holiday season – the archipelago off the atlantic coast of northern africa entirely depends on tourism .
local authorities said they hoped to bring the blaze under control on sunday .
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is expected to fly to la palma later in the day to oversee efforts to tackle the fire .
since the the start of this year , at least eight people have been killed by fires in mainland spain .

for a small fee they can get off the beaten path by stepping onto a bus that stops at contemporary art sites . for five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- , contemporary art aficionados can bypass the stress of driving in a foreign city and be chauffeured on the " art bus " to some of paris ' more hidden or hard-to-get-to contemporary art spaces and centers . " the idea is to show them places where maybe they wouldn ’ t go by themselves , " said selma toprak of the paris contemporary art network , the non-profit organization which operates the tour . " it helps visitors to find contemporary art that exists beyond the walls of well-known art galleries , museums and art spaces listed in most paris city guide books . " the tours also allow people to meet and speak with the directors of galleries or artists themselves . each month the bus visits different art locations , such as an open house of the national fine arts school to see works by recent graduates or the domaine de chamarande , a contemporary art museum in a 17th-century chateau an hour south of the city . the artistic director of the center , judith quentel , takes tour groups through the chateau grounds , explaining the history of the site , and conducting private tours of the permanent exhibitions . the current exhibit is called " au pied de la lettre , " a french idiomatic expression that means taking words at face value .
all of the works in the exhibition have something to do with the written word . personal service it is the personal service and detailed explanations that attract art lovers to the service .
nicole baatz said it 's particularly valuable that those on the tour get to meet the artists in person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour stops at exhibitions and galleries off the main tourist route " that ’ s very interesting because normally , you don ’ t get to see the artists , " said nicole baatz .
" and you learn so much more than if you visited the place on your own . " the domaine de chamarande is located more than 40 kilometers outside of paris and it is often hard for them to lure people from the city .
artistic director judith quentel thinks the art bus solves that problem for them . the taxi-tram " allows cultural sites located on the periphery of the capital , which are of equal artistic quality , to exist , " said quentel .
" it also brings visitors here for the first time who may then come again . " the monthly taxi-tram visits are becoming so popular that there are never vacant seats .
starting next year , the tours will take place every weekend . author : genevieve oger -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

for a small fee they can get off the beaten path by stepping onto a bus that stops at contemporary art sites . for five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- , contemporary art aficionados can bypass the stress of driving in a foreign city and be chauffeured on the " art bus " to some of paris ' more hidden or hard-to-get-to contemporary art spaces and centers . " the idea is to show them places where maybe they wouldn ’ t go by themselves , " said selma toprak of the paris contemporary art network , the non-profit organization which operates the tour . " it helps visitors to find contemporary art that exists beyond the walls of well-known art galleries , museums and art spaces listed in most paris city guide books . " the tours also allow people to meet and speak with the directors of galleries or artists themselves . each month the bus visits different art locations , such as an open house of the national fine arts school to see works by recent graduates or the domaine de chamarande , a contemporary art museum in a 17th-century chateau an hour south of the city . the artistic director of the center , judith quentel , takes tour groups through the chateau grounds , explaining the history of the site , and conducting private tours of the permanent exhibitions . the current exhibit is called " au pied de la lettre , " a french idiomatic expression that means taking words at face value .
all of the works in the exhibition have something to do with the written word . personal service it is the personal service and detailed explanations that attract art lovers to the service .
nicole baatz said it 's particularly valuable that those on the tour get to meet the artists in person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour stops at exhibitions and galleries off the main tourist route " that ’ s very interesting because normally , you don ’ t get to see the artists , " said nicole baatz .
" and you learn so much more than if you visited the place on your own . " the domaine de chamarande is located more than 40 kilometers outside of paris and it is often hard for them to lure people from the city .
artistic director judith quentel thinks the art bus solves that problem for them . the taxi-tram " allows cultural sites located on the periphery of the capital , which are of equal artistic quality , to exist , " said quentel .
" it also brings visitors here for the first time who may then come again . " the monthly taxi-tram visits are becoming so popular that there are never vacant seats .
starting next year , the tours will take place every weekend . author : genevieve oger -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his predecessor kofi annan - while not being very popular with the bush administration - was generally highly regarded around the world during his tenure .
in fact , his international popularity was enhanced due to his frequent public disagreements with washington . all that changed when former south korean diplomat ban began his five-year term at the united nations .
not only did ban enjoy the full support of the united states - still the un 's most important stakeholder - but the tone and style of the rhetoric coming out of un headquarters in new york also changed . from the start of his tenure much has been written about ban 's style of speaking and his public perception - a lot of it negative .
ban himself has never claimed to be a great orator but maintains that substance trumps perception . so now that he has passed the half-way mark of his first term as un secretary-general , how has ban and the united nations been faring with an approach that differs markedly from that of his predecessor ? while some critics have condemned ban as a total failure and ridiculed him as the invisible man , the experts deutsche welle talked to have a more nuanced take on the un chief . " those who call him an abject failure are certainly wrong , because they misread the challenges he was up to .
but those who simply defend him , and say that he has done a good job and no improvement is necessary are also wrong " , says thorsten benner , a un expert and associate director of berlin 's global public policy institute .
" i think his record so far is mixed . " tough job that applies to all roles ban has to play as secretary-general , namely being the world 's top diplomat , the ceo of the world 's most troubled bureaucracy and the world 's conscience , adds benner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban wants to reform the un 's bureaucracy kara mcdonald , former director for un affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush and now international affairs fellow in residence at the council on foreign relations , agrees . " i would certainly not call him an abject failure .
i think a lot of those analyses do n't take into account the realism of the job and what he is facing .
the post is one of the toughest jobs in the world .
it 's one that you would n't wish upon your worst enemy , " she says . as for ban 's biggest achievements so far , both experts say that the secretary-general has tried to push climate change to the forefront of the global agenda , also with specific countries , such as the united states and china , which have been reluctant until recently to take action on the issue . another area where ban tried to make his mark early on has been reforms to the un 's notorious bureaucracy . losing steam benner and mcdonald praise him for raising the issue , but both point out that the initiative quickly lost steam . " he has been pushing for this , but his leadership style has n't been conducive at all to get others to follow him " , says benner .
" he has given the impression that he surrounds himself with a coterie of korean advisers on the 38th floor -lrb- of the un building in new york -rrb- , and by and large the staff of the un secretariat have been unwilling to follow him . " ban 's advocacy on climate change has been hampered by similar setbacks , says benner . " due to his very toned-down style and his not very forceful rhetoric not many have noticed his activism on that front , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general ban during his disappointing trip to burma while benner said ban must rethink his style but not necessarily the messages themselves , mcdonald does n't see the secretary-general 's public rhetoric and profile as the main problem . " i personally am less concerned about profile than i am about results and occupation with legacy and re-election over the day-to-day operation of the united nations , " she said . " i think on the latter score , ban has delegated a substantial amount of authority to his inner circle and to ambassador kim , who is his deputy chief-of-staff , in particular , and there has been some criticism of that delegation line and of his inner circle . " results matter on a very practical level , ban needs to re-evaluate his agenda and priorities , argued mcdonald , citing his most recent trip to burma from where he returned largely empty-handed . " the broader issue of engaging and travelling to countries without a sense of clear results beforehand has harmed the secretary-general , " she said . what 's more , added mcdonald , any secretary-general must be ready to break some china .

" the tours also allow people to meet and speak with the directors of galleries or artists themselves . each month the bus visits different art locations , such as an open house of the national fine arts school to see works by recent graduates or the domaine de chamarande , a contemporary art museum in a 17th-century chateau an hour south of the city . the artistic director of the center , judith quentel , takes tour groups through the chateau grounds , explaining the history of the site , and conducting private tours of the permanent exhibitions . the current exhibit is called " au pied de la lettre , " a french idiomatic expression that means taking words at face value .
all of the works in the exhibition have something to do with the written word . personal service it is the personal service and detailed explanations that attract art lovers to the service .
nicole baatz said it 's particularly valuable that those on the tour get to meet the artists in person . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tour stops at exhibitions and galleries off the main tourist route " that ’ s very interesting because normally , you don ’ t get to see the artists , " said nicole baatz .
" and you learn so much more than if you visited the place on your own . " the domaine de chamarande is located more than 40 kilometers outside of paris and it is often hard for them to lure people from the city .
artistic director judith quentel thinks the art bus solves that problem for them . the taxi-tram " allows cultural sites located on the periphery of the capital , which are of equal artistic quality , to exist , " said quentel .
" it also brings visitors here for the first time who may then come again . " the monthly taxi-tram visits are becoming so popular that there are never vacant seats .
starting next year , the tours will take place every weekend . author : genevieve oger -lrb- cn -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

olivier de schutter , the un 's point man on the issue , tells dw what to do about it . olivier de schutter has been the un special rapporteur on the right to food since may 2008 .
he is a law professor at the catholic university of louvain and at the college of europe in natolin and holds degrees from harvard university , the international institute of human rights in strasbourg and the catholic university of louvain .
many international institutions such as the food and agriculture organisation have issued reports recently detailing the problems of the practice of so called " land grabbing , " i.e. international investors buying or leasing farmland mainly in africa .
is this really a new issue and is the attention it has gotten justified ?
the issue is not entirely new .
there have been in the past investors present in developing countries for the purposes of producing , for example , cotton , coffee , or other commodities for exports .
but the scale at which this is now happening is very impressive .
we already have information about deals representing some 30 million hectares , which is more than the total farmland of a country such as france .
this is can be explained by the fact that since the global food crisis of 2007 and 2008 countries and investors have understood that agriculture is going to be a very important sector in the future and that farmland which can be cultivated will become a scarce resource .
could you give a concrete example that highlights why land grabbing is a critical topic for the international community ?
the countries targeted by these deals , particularly in sub-saharan africa where labor is relatively cheap and where land is considered plentiful , will be potentially increasingly dependent on international markets to achieve food security .
so they will produce more food , but this food will be exported . this is one of the things we saw during the global food crisis of 2007/2008 .
countries that are the least self-sufficient and most dependent on international markets have been most severely affected by increasingly volatile prices .
supporters of land grabbing say it is an important factor in modernizing africa 's unproductive agricultural sector , that it helps establish international food security and can provide jobs for domestic workers .
are they right or is land grabbing bad per se ?
no .
it 's absolutely important to recognize that for many years we have invested far too little in agriculture .
the decline has been very significant since the 1980 's .
both in official development aid and in government budgets too little attention has been paid to agriculture .
so it is good news that money is now coming into the sector and that private and public investors are investing more in food production .
the problem is how is this managed , how are the resources going to be shared between the governments and the local population concerned and how can the local population benefit from this investment .
and at the moment the process is not transparent , the guarantees are insufficient that the arrival of investors will not worsen rather than improve the situation of the local population .
the gulf countries , but also south korea , india and china are considered to be most active in pursuing agricultural plots in africa .
which of them is the biggest investor and do some countries behave more sensibly than others ?
this is very difficult to answer , because it is extremely difficult to monitor the scope and scale at which these investments are developing .
in many cases countries have sovereign wealth funds which have stakes in private investment funds and are behind deals which on the surface resemble deals between a private investor and a host country .
in other cases these countries are present directly in developing countries in which they lease or buy land , but often the deals they negotiate are not public and they are not dealt with transparently , so it is very difficult to estimate the respective importance of the countries you mentioned .
but it is clear that the crucial aspect here is whether these deals will be sufficiently monitored by civil organizations , by peasants ' organizations and whether governments will act with full transparency .
the key here is good governance .
bildunterschrift : poor countries could become dependent on international markets for their food supply what must be done to enable both international investors and the local population to profit from agricultural investments by foreign countries and companies ?
there have been a few proposals concerning guidelines to be adopted at the international level .
for example the prime minister of japan , taro aso , has proposed that in the next un general assembly meeting in september he would convene a round table of interested stake holders in order to achieve agreement on these principles .
i think this is an excellent initiative which i salute .
i do think however that already now , even before adopting such a code of conduct for guidelines we have norms which investors and host states alike should comply with .
and these norms are those of international human rights instruments .
for example , investors should respect the right to self-determination of the host country , which means that the exploitation of resources should primarily benefit the local population and serve local needs before serving the interests of the foreign investor .
so i think we already have a number of principles which are implicit in human rights and which i try to make explicit by addressing a few recommendations to the international community as to how these deals could be better managed in the future .

a century later , the non-leaguers celebrated their historic victory with a rematch against a juventus side in turin ... but only after a long trek , just like their footballing forefathers .
pre-season friendlies rarely get players buzzing with excitement .
but the noise and banter and sense of occasion on board the west auckland team bus soon told you this was not a typical friendly .
the part-timers were retracing a journey first taken 100 years ago when the club was selected to represent england in italy in one of the earliest international football contests .
it was an unlikely choice , because the team were not well-known and it is still not clear exactly why they were picked .
one theory is that the organiser sir thomas lipton - the man behind lipton 's teas - had contacts in the northern league .
and yet , against all the odds , the pitmen beat the professionals and lifted the trophy .
and , just to prove it was no fluke , they repeated the feat two years later , thumping the mighty juventus 6-1 in the final .
inspiration and expectation the mines may have gone , but west auckland remain a proud amateur outfit , made up these days of college students , gas fitters , electricians and plumbers .
for them , the journey across the continent had barely changed either .
just like the original team , the lads of 2009 were forced to make the 800-mile trip by land and sea after the air fare proved too expensive .
there 's not many people at our level get the opportunity to go to italy and play against a top team like juventus leigh grant west auckland centre-half it meant a marathon 24-hour coach ride through the night , giving the players time to reflect on their illustrious predecessors - young men with bristling moustaches and long baggy shorts whose black-and-white images are a source of inspiration as well as expectation .
" it 's a lot to live up to , but it makes you feel if they managed it 100 years ago then we can give it our best as well and see what happens , " said striker chris musgrave , a student at durham university .
" there 's not many people at our level get the opportunity to go to italy and play against a top team like juventus , " added centre-back and accountant leigh grant .
" so it 's important we hold our own and do n't let ourselves down . "
' proper trophy ' when the coach pulled up at juventus ' training ground , where the match was to take place in the foothills of the italian alps , club officials were keen to show off their most valuable cargo - the world cup itself .
sadly , it is a replica .
the real thing was stolen from the clubhouse back in 1994 and , despite a police investigation and a big money reward , it was never found .
but the battered wooden box is original .

the new season starts next saturday with a slightly less glamorous fixture against west allotment celtic , but these players will always share special memories of their trip to renew acquaintances with their old rivals juventus .
history may have left the two teams worlds apart , but the world cup still goes home with west auckland .
