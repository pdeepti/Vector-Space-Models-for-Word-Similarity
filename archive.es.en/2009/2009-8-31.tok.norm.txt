they plan to try to get the rest of the eu on board before september 's g-20 meeting . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed to take a common approach regarding bankers ' bonus payments , following a meeting in berlin on monday . unbridled risk-taking by some bankers has often been cited as one of the main factors that led to the global financial crisis , and the incentive of lucrative bonus payments has often been blamed for stoking bankers ' willingness to take chances . " the international community needs to understand that the excesses of speculation and financial -lrb- institutions -rrb- which led to the crisis can not resume as though nothing had happened , " sarkozy said in berlin . merkel reiterated demands for international regulations that would keep the size of global banks in check . " no bank can be allowed to become so big that it is in a position to blackmail governments , " she said . merkel and sarkozy have also called on the european union to adopt a common stance before the two-day g-20 meeting , which is to be held in the us city of pittsburgh beginning on september 24 . global regulations a tough sell despite berlin and paris both coming out in clear support of international bank regulations as a way of preventing any future global financial crisis from happening , getting the rest of the g-20 nations to accept these terms is another story .

" they feel that their financial centers would suffer if there is too much regulation .
and therefore they are for continuing the system they had for many years . " he noted that in the absence of international standards countries that do have tough bonus regulations would be at a disadvantage compared to countries with looser regulations . " -lsb- german investment bankers -rsb- would tell the government : if they are too strict , they will quit the country and go to other places , like london , " gerke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 summit is scheduled for september 24-25 in pittsburgh .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 31.08.2009 merkel remains optimistic about party 's chances despite heavy losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel put a brave face on her party 's heavy losses the german chancellor remains optimistic that her cdu will be able to form a coalition with its preferred partner after next month 's federal election despite setbacks for her party in two out of three state polls . speaking to reporters in berlin , chancellor angela merkel rejected calls from some quarters in her party to change course after her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took heavy hits in the states of saarland and thuringia . merkel said her party still had " every possibility of winning the federal election " and forming the next government in a coalition with the business-friendly liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university , said .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " alliance with the left not easy for spd but the spd still faces a tough task of turning around its dismal ratings .
merkel 's party still leads by a large margin in opinion polls . the left party , descendants of the former ruling party of communist east germany , and the fdp , were sunday 's biggest winners . but any state cooperation between the spd , the green party and the left party - descendants of the ruling party of former communist east germany - could be targeted by the conservatives to warn of a " red wave . " given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party in western germany so far .
the social democrats have however repeatedly ruled out any federal coalition with the left party . outcome wide open but on monday , many german newspapers warned against reading too much into sunday 's election results . " interpreting this setback -lsb- for merkel -rsb- as a clear signal of a turnaround in the battle for berlin in four weeks is wide of the mark , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
business daily handelsblatt noted that " trying to predict the outcome of the federal election from sunday 's results is about as reliable as reading tea leaves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 31.08.2009 merkel remains optimistic about party 's chances despite heavy losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel put a brave face on her party 's heavy losses the german chancellor remains optimistic that her cdu will be able to form a coalition with its preferred partner after next month 's federal election despite setbacks for her party in two out of three state polls . speaking to reporters in berlin , chancellor angela merkel rejected calls from some quarters in her party to change course after her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took heavy hits in the states of saarland and thuringia . merkel said her party still had " every possibility of winning the federal election " and forming the next government in a coalition with the business-friendly liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university , said .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " alliance with the left not easy for spd but the spd still faces a tough task of turning around its dismal ratings .
merkel 's party still leads by a large margin in opinion polls . the left party , descendants of the former ruling party of communist east germany , and the fdp , were sunday 's biggest winners . but any state cooperation between the spd , the green party and the left party - descendants of the ruling party of former communist east germany - could be targeted by the conservatives to warn of a " red wave . " given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party in western germany so far .
the social democrats have however repeatedly ruled out any federal coalition with the left party . outcome wide open but on monday , many german newspapers warned against reading too much into sunday 's election results . " interpreting this setback -lsb- for merkel -rsb- as a clear signal of a turnaround in the battle for berlin in four weeks is wide of the mark , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
business daily handelsblatt noted that " trying to predict the outcome of the federal election from sunday 's results is about as reliable as reading tea leaves .

but the cdu still remains the largest party in both states .
" the vote losses in thuringia and saarland are painful , " cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said sunday after the polls closed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland premier peter mueller will likely lose his job after his cdu party lost heavily the losses at the state level could be a blow for chancellor angela merkel , who 's campaigning for a second term in federal elections to be held september 27 .
merkel 's party looks likely to only hold onto the former east german state of saxony , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich . " the saxons have voted wisely , " tillich said sunday evening .
" i accept this responsibility with gratitude but also with respect for the will of the voters . " red-red-green coalitions possible next door in thuringia , incumbent cdu premier dieter althaus could lose office after his party drew only about 31 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent five years ago . althaus saw his popularity dip after he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for crashing into and killing a 41-year-old woman on a ski slope in austria on new year 's day . he could form a coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , mirroring the current national government .
alternatively , a coalition between the spd , the far-left left party and the environmentalist green party is also possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher compared to the last election in thuringia and the saarland in the western german state of saarland , the cdu had ruled alone after pulling in 47.5 percent of the vote in 2004 .
projections from sunday 's election say the party will receive just 35 percent of the vote , which could lead to an spd , left party , green coalition as in thuringia . if the left party enters a coalition in the saarland , it would be the first time the party , which is composed of former east german communists and disaffected former sdp members , joins a government in western germany . given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party .
in order to reassure potential voters ahead of next month 's national election , spd head franz muenterfering ruled out sunday night an alliance between the two parties on the national level . social democrats breathe a small sigh of relief sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the spd , which has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the saxon government , the party seems likely to gain power in saarland and thuringia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's steinmeier spoke of a " good election sunday " " i have heard many time in the last few weeks that the federal election is over .
this evening shows that that was wrong , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , said . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " said karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " merkel 's preferred coalition partner , the pro-market free democratic party also made gains sunday .
saxon premier tillich is likely to form a coalition with the free democrats after projections showed the party pulling in over 10 percent of the vote .
but a cdu-fdp coalition was blocked in the other two states holding polls sunday . " we 're the winners of this evening , " fdp chief guido westerwelle said on sunday evening .
he said the results , which may lead to left-leaning coalitions in thuringia and the saarland , should be considered " a warning shot for the entire republic . " the far-right extremist npd party failed to gain seats in the thuringia parliament .
the npd , which is under surveillance for its anti-immigrant message , managed to hold onto its seats in the saxon parliament , though its share fell to about 5 percent , down from over 9 percent five years ago . author : bn / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 31.08.2009 sarkozy to launch global challenge to bank bonus culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy wants the banking sector to clean up its act french president nicolas sarkozy 's visit to berlin aims to find common ground between germany and france ahead of the g-20 summit in pittsburgh , where paris will push for global rules limiting rewards for traders . nicolas sarkozy intends to lobby other world leaders in a bid to rein in large bonus payments in the banking world .
french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .
for president sarkozy , only too aware of public opinion , the bonus issue provides another chance to take a lead on the world stage .
one prominent economist believes the pittsburgh summit will be the last window of opportunity for reform .
" next year we could expect a mild rebound in the economy , " said christian de boissieu of the sorbonne university .
" i think the appetite for global reform is going to diminish .
pittsburgh is perhaps the last chance to draw together the main implications of this crisis . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 31.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's chances are still good , despite lost ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state ballots in saarland , saxony and thuringia show the christian democrats losing ground , the spd still weak and smaller parties gaining votes .
dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .
unfortunately , it was the first time the neo-nazi party was able to re-enter the state parliament , signalling that the danger of having a disastrous " brown " faction in germany 's parliament is not out of the question .

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 31.08.2009 in turnaround , muslim author to receive german culture prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some took offense at author kermani 's look at the cross an ongoing controversy over a german culture prize has been resolved .
an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .
unfortunately , it was the first time the neo-nazi party was able to re-enter the state parliament , signalling that the danger of having a disastrous " brown " faction in germany 's parliament is not out of the question .

french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .
for president sarkozy , only too aware of public opinion , the bonus issue provides another chance to take a lead on the world stage .
one prominent economist believes the pittsburgh summit will be the last window of opportunity for reform .
" next year we could expect a mild rebound in the economy , " said christian de boissieu of the sorbonne university .
" i think the appetite for global reform is going to diminish .
pittsburgh is perhaps the last chance to draw together the main implications of this crisis . "
the last g-20 summit in london in april set out broad principles for world banks .

french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .

the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .
for president sarkozy , only too aware of public opinion , the bonus issue provides another chance to take a lead on the world stage .
one prominent economist believes the pittsburgh summit will be the last window of opportunity for reform .
" next year we could expect a mild rebound in the economy , " said christian de boissieu of the sorbonne university .

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 31.08.2009 merkel remains optimistic about party 's chances despite heavy losses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel put a brave face on her party 's heavy losses the german chancellor remains optimistic that her cdu will be able to form a coalition with its preferred partner after next month 's federal election despite setbacks for her party in two out of three state polls . speaking to reporters in berlin , chancellor angela merkel rejected calls from some quarters in her party to change course after her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- took heavy hits in the states of saarland and thuringia . merkel said her party still had " every possibility of winning the federal election " and forming the next government in a coalition with the business-friendly liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university , said .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " alliance with the left not easy for spd but the spd still faces a tough task of turning around its dismal ratings .
merkel 's party still leads by a large margin in opinion polls . the left party , descendants of the former ruling party of communist east germany , and the fdp , were sunday 's biggest winners . but any state cooperation between the spd , the green party and the left party - descendants of the ruling party of former communist east germany - could be targeted by the conservatives to warn of a " red wave . " given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party in western germany so far .
the social democrats have however repeatedly ruled out any federal coalition with the left party . outcome wide open but on monday , many german newspapers warned against reading too much into sunday 's election results . " interpreting this setback -lsb- for merkel -rsb- as a clear signal of a turnaround in the battle for berlin in four weeks is wide of the mark , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
business daily handelsblatt noted that " trying to predict the outcome of the federal election from sunday 's results is about as reliable as reading tea leaves .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .
germany has just over 4,200 bundeswehr troops in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

but the cdu still remains the largest party in both states .
" the vote losses in thuringia and saarland are painful , " cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said sunday after the polls closed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland premier peter mueller will likely lose his job after his cdu party lost heavily the losses at the state level could be a blow for chancellor angela merkel , who 's campaigning for a second term in federal elections to be held september 27 .
merkel 's party looks likely to only hold onto the former east german state of saxony , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich . " the saxons have voted wisely , " tillich said sunday evening .
" i accept this responsibility with gratitude but also with respect for the will of the voters . " red-red-green coalitions possible next door in thuringia , incumbent cdu premier dieter althaus could lose office after his party drew only about 31 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent five years ago . althaus saw his popularity dip after he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for crashing into and killing a 41-year-old woman on a ski slope in austria on new year 's day . he could form a coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , mirroring the current national government .
alternatively , a coalition between the spd , the far-left left party and the environmentalist green party is also possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher compared to the last election in thuringia and the saarland in the western german state of saarland , the cdu had ruled alone after pulling in 47.5 percent of the vote in 2004 .
projections from sunday 's election say the party will receive just 35 percent of the vote , which could lead to an spd , left party , green coalition as in thuringia . if the left party enters a coalition in the saarland , it would be the first time the party , which is composed of former east german communists and disaffected former sdp members , joins a government in western germany . given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party .
in order to reassure potential voters ahead of next month 's national election , spd head franz muenterfering ruled out sunday night an alliance between the two parties on the national level . social democrats breathe a small sigh of relief sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the spd , which has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the saxon government , the party seems likely to gain power in saarland and thuringia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's steinmeier spoke of a " good election sunday " " i have heard many time in the last few weeks that the federal election is over .
this evening shows that that was wrong , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , said . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " said karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " merkel 's preferred coalition partner , the pro-market free democratic party also made gains sunday .
saxon premier tillich is likely to form a coalition with the free democrats after projections showed the party pulling in over 10 percent of the vote .
but a cdu-fdp coalition was blocked in the other two states holding polls sunday . " we 're the winners of this evening , " fdp chief guido westerwelle said on sunday evening .
he said the results , which may lead to left-leaning coalitions in thuringia and the saarland , should be considered " a warning shot for the entire republic . " the far-right extremist npd party failed to gain seats in the thuringia parliament .
the npd , which is under surveillance for its anti-immigrant message , managed to hold onto its seats in the saxon parliament , though its share fell to about 5 percent , down from over 9 percent five years ago . author : bn / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br .

they plan to try to get the rest of the eu on board before september 's g-20 meeting . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed to take a common approach regarding bankers ' bonus payments , following a meeting in berlin on monday . unbridled risk-taking by some bankers has often been cited as one of the main factors that led to the global financial crisis , and the incentive of lucrative bonus payments has often been blamed for stoking bankers ' willingness to take chances . " the international community needs to understand that the excesses of speculation and financial -lrb- institutions -rrb- which led to the crisis can not resume as though nothing had happened , " sarkozy said in berlin . merkel reiterated demands for international regulations that would keep the size of global banks in check . " no bank can be allowed to become so big that it is in a position to blackmail governments , " she said . merkel and sarkozy have also called on the european union to adopt a common stance before the two-day g-20 meeting , which is to be held in the us city of pittsburgh beginning on september 24 . global regulations a tough sell despite berlin and paris both coming out in clear support of international bank regulations as a way of preventing any future global financial crisis from happening , getting the rest of the g-20 nations to accept these terms is another story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance expert wolfgang gerke says it is critical for banking regulations to be applied worldwide " you need the acceptance of all of the g-20 countries , especially the united states and great britain , " wolfgang gerke , president of the bavarian center of finance , told deutsche welle .
" they feel that their financial centers would suffer if there is too much regulation .
and therefore they are for continuing the system they had for many years . " he noted that in the absence of international standards countries that do have tough bonus regulations would be at a disadvantage compared to countries with looser regulations .

" even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , the climate will continue to change , " gro harlem brundtland , the united nations secretary-general 's special envoy on climate change , said on monday .
" all countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate . " but the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms , rising sea levels , droughts , and famine , but how the information is used , according to wmo secretary-general michel jarraud . " the problem is that much information on the climate is not used properly , " jarraud told reporters .
" it 's time to link technology and science with decision makers . " climate justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan said rich countries should make the biggest emissions cuts the conference comes before world leaders and delegates are set to meet in copenhagen in december in an effort to agree on a binding deal that would curb global warming before the kyoto protocol , the current compromise on reducing greenhouse gases , runs out in 2012 . former un secretary-general kofi annan told delegates in geneva that climate agreements had to be " radical , universal and binding " and have " climate justice at its heart . " annan said the people most affected by climate change were the poorest and least developed nations that contributed the least to pollution . " the most advanced economies must take the lead by taking the most drastic -lrb- emissions -rrb- cuts , " the former un head said , while urging countries to share weather information and cooperate on climate issues . better data for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians need good data as the basis of their decisions , jarraud said climate change is already underway and will continue regardless of any compromises made at major climate negotiations , jarraud added . " even if copenhagen is successful on greenhouse gases , a certain warming -lrb- of the planet -rrb- will occur , " he said , adding that improved knowledge of the climate could help manage water and food needs , in addition to preserving the environment . jarraud gave the examples of malaria and cholera , two potentially fatal diseases that spread in certain climate conditions .
better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur . " we need to anticipate change , we can no longer base ourselves on the past to take decisions for the future , " he told journalists . the information can also help reduce costs and benefit sectors of the economy , such as tourism . " climate change is here now and countries need tools to adapt to the changing climate , " the wmo wrote in its invitation to the world climate conference . the meeting of representatives from some 80 nations is the third world climate conference .
the first took place in 1979 and the second in 1990 .
those meetings are credited with leading to the creation of the intergovernmental panel on climate change , which won the 2007 nobel peace prize . sms / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.08.2009 merkel 's cdu party experiences setback in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of merkel 's cdu party are disappointed with the results in saarland and thuringia just a month before national elections , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats suffered losses in two out of three state elections , while the left-wing left party and the liberal free democrats gained ground . the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- seems likely to lose control of governments in saarland and thuringia after state elections sunday , according to projections from the ard and zdf public television networks .
but the cdu still remains the largest party in both states .
" the vote losses in thuringia and saarland are painful , " cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said sunday after the polls closed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland premier peter mueller will likely lose his job after his cdu party lost heavily the losses at the state level could be a blow for chancellor angela merkel , who 's campaigning for a second term in federal elections to be held september 27 .
merkel 's party looks likely to only hold onto the former east german state of saxony , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich . " the saxons have voted wisely , " tillich said sunday evening .
" i accept this responsibility with gratitude but also with respect for the will of the voters . " red-red-green coalitions possible next door in thuringia , incumbent cdu premier dieter althaus could lose office after his party drew only about 31 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent five years ago . althaus saw his popularity dip after he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for crashing into and killing a 41-year-old woman on a ski slope in austria on new year 's day . he could form a coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , mirroring the current national government .
alternatively , a coalition between the spd , the far-left left party and the environmentalist green party is also possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher compared to the last election in thuringia and the saarland in the western german state of saarland , the cdu had ruled alone after pulling in 47.5 percent of the vote in 2004 .
projections from sunday 's election say the party will receive just 35 percent of the vote , which could lead to an spd , left party , green coalition as in thuringia . if the left party enters a coalition in the saarland , it would be the first time the party , which is composed of former east german communists and disaffected former sdp members , joins a government in western germany . given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party .
in order to reassure potential voters ahead of next month 's national election , spd head franz muenterfering ruled out sunday night an alliance between the two parties on the national level . social democrats breathe a small sigh of relief sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the spd , which has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the saxon government , the party seems likely to gain power in saarland and thuringia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's steinmeier spoke of a " good election sunday " " i have heard many time in the last few weeks that the federal election is over .
this evening shows that that was wrong , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , said . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " said karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " merkel 's preferred coalition partner , the pro-market free democratic party also made gains sunday .
saxon premier tillich is likely to form a coalition with the free democrats after projections showed the party pulling in over 10 percent of the vote .
but a cdu-fdp coalition was blocked in the other two states holding polls sunday . " we 're the winners of this evening , " fdp chief guido westerwelle said on sunday evening .
he said the results , which may lead to left-leaning coalitions in thuringia and the saarland , should be considered " a warning shot for the entire republic . " the far-right extremist npd party failed to gain seats in the thuringia parliament .
the npd , which is under surveillance for its anti-immigrant message , managed to hold onto its seats in the saxon parliament , though its share fell to about 5 percent , down from over 9 percent five years ago . author : bn / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , the climate will continue to change , " gro harlem brundtland , the united nations secretary-general 's special envoy on climate change , said on monday .
" all countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate . " but the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms , rising sea levels , droughts , and famine , but how the information is used , according to wmo secretary-general michel jarraud .

better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur .

" both sides will make their best efforts for the timely progression of the ratification in line with their constitutional and legal procedures . "
decades-long hostility in april of this year , armenia and turkey said they had agreed on a roadmap to normalize bilateral ties after decades of tense relations .

but the cdu still remains the largest party in both states .
" the vote losses in thuringia and saarland are painful , " cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said sunday after the polls closed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland premier peter mueller will likely lose his job after his cdu party lost heavily the losses at the state level could be a blow for chancellor angela merkel , who 's campaigning for a second term in federal elections to be held september 27 .
merkel 's party looks likely to only hold onto the former east german state of saxony , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich . " the saxons have voted wisely , " tillich said sunday evening .
" i accept this responsibility with gratitude but also with respect for the will of the voters . " red-red-green coalitions possible next door in thuringia , incumbent cdu premier dieter althaus could lose office after his party drew only about 31 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent five years ago . althaus saw his popularity dip after he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for crashing into and killing a 41-year-old woman on a ski slope in austria on new year 's day . he could form a coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , mirroring the current national government .
alternatively , a coalition between the spd , the far-left left party and the environmentalist green party is also possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher compared to the last election in thuringia and the saarland in the western german state of saarland , the cdu had ruled alone after pulling in 47.5 percent of the vote in 2004 .
projections from sunday 's election say the party will receive just 35 percent of the vote , which could lead to an spd , left party , green coalition as in thuringia . if the left party enters a coalition in the saarland , it would be the first time the party , which is composed of former east german communists and disaffected former sdp members , joins a government in western germany . given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party .
in order to reassure potential voters ahead of next month 's national election , spd head franz muenterfering ruled out sunday night an alliance between the two parties on the national level . social democrats breathe a small sigh of relief sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the spd , which has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the saxon government , the party seems likely to gain power in saarland and thuringia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's steinmeier spoke of a " good election sunday " " i have heard many time in the last few weeks that the federal election is over .
this evening shows that that was wrong , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , said . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " said karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " merkel 's preferred coalition partner , the pro-market free democratic party also made gains sunday .
saxon premier tillich is likely to form a coalition with the free democrats after projections showed the party pulling in over 10 percent of the vote .
but a cdu-fdp coalition was blocked in the other two states holding polls sunday . " we 're the winners of this evening , " fdp chief guido westerwelle said on sunday evening .
he said the results , which may lead to left-leaning coalitions in thuringia and the saarland , should be considered " a warning shot for the entire republic . " the far-right extremist npd party failed to gain seats in the thuringia parliament .
the npd , which is under surveillance for its anti-immigrant message , managed to hold onto its seats in the saxon parliament , though its share fell to about 5 percent , down from over 9 percent five years ago . author : bn / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily .

merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university , said .

these planned power outages due to a lack in capacity affect the whole country and are called " load shedding " .
industries have stopped working due to electricity shortages , leading to a loss in the production .
this again means that people are thrown out of jobs .
saheed farhaz , the owner of nafisa textiles in lahore says , " i am facing 5 to 8 hours of load shedding a day now .
i have to pay the labour charges and other input costs , so definitely the result will be a huge loss .
so power is a big issue here . "
not only for the industrial sector , also for common men and women .
without air condition or fans , the heat becomes unbearable .
a karachi resident complains , " as a common pakistani , i am suffering a lot because of this power shortage .
unfortunately , i am unable to go on with my daily routine and can not even reach office on time due to the long power breaks at night . "
capacity shortages pakistan failed to implement long-needed power projects during the economic boom between 2002 and 2007 .
although the government has now approved the 4,500 megawatt diamer-bhasa dam project and other hydropower projects to overcome the energy crisis , experts think a short term plan is in need .
professor abid a. burki from the lahore university of management sciences says : " for example we have sugar mills and other manufacturing units who have surplus electricity and you need to devise a mechanism how that electricity can be brought into the main system .
secondly , pakistan possesses the third largest coal reserves in the world and it is about time that the policy makers seriously consider the potential to generate electricity through coal .
and finally , the policy makers in pakistan must start popularising energy use efficiency simply by raising awareness . "
outsourcing power generation while the government has taken up a temporary plan of outsourcing power generation to private so-called rental power plants , burki thinks this solution is too expensive , as they tend to charge more for the electricity .
" this is a double edged sword " , says burki .
" because letting a shortfall in electricity persist would contribute to a slowdown in the growth rate of pakistan 's economy ; on the other hand , achieving self-sufficiency by involving these rental power plants might again lead to a slowdown in the growth rate because the cost of electricity would shoot up . "
experts believe it is high time that a stable policy is implemented to solve the problem .
otherwise , the widespread agitations and protests against the power crisis all over pakistan will destabilize the country further and hamper its focus on fighting militancy and terrorism .

these planned power outages due to a lack in capacity affect the whole country and are called " load shedding " .
industries have stopped working due to electricity shortages , leading to a loss in the production .
this again means that people are thrown out of jobs .
saheed farhaz , the owner of nafisa textiles in lahore says , " i am facing 5 to 8 hours of load shedding a day now .
i have to pay the labour charges and other input costs , so definitely the result will be a huge loss .
so power is a big issue here . "
not only for the industrial sector , also for common men and women .
without air condition or fans , the heat becomes unbearable .
a karachi resident complains , " as a common pakistani , i am suffering a lot because of this power shortage .
unfortunately , i am unable to go on with my daily routine and can not even reach office on time due to the long power breaks at night . "
capacity shortages pakistan failed to implement long-needed power projects during the economic boom between 2002 and 2007 .
although the government has now approved the 4,500 megawatt diamer-bhasa dam project and other hydropower projects to overcome the energy crisis , experts think a short term plan is in need .
professor abid a. burki from the lahore university of management sciences says : " for example we have sugar mills and other manufacturing units who have surplus electricity and you need to devise a mechanism how that electricity can be brought into the main system .
secondly , pakistan possesses the third largest coal reserves in the world and it is about time that the policy makers seriously consider the potential to generate electricity through coal .
and finally , the policy makers in pakistan must start popularising energy use efficiency simply by raising awareness . "
outsourcing power generation while the government has taken up a temporary plan of outsourcing power generation to private so-called rental power plants , burki thinks this solution is too expensive , as they tend to charge more for the electricity .
" this is a double edged sword " , says burki .
" because letting a shortfall in electricity persist would contribute to a slowdown in the growth rate of pakistan 's economy ; on the other hand , achieving self-sufficiency by involving these rental power plants might again lead to a slowdown in the growth rate because the cost of electricity would shoot up .

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university , said .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " alliance with the left not easy for spd but the spd still faces a tough task of turning around its dismal ratings .
merkel 's party still leads by a large margin in opinion polls . the left party , descendants of the former ruling party of communist east germany , and the fdp , were sunday 's biggest winners . but any state cooperation between the spd , the green party and the left party - descendants of the ruling party of former communist east germany - could be targeted by the conservatives to warn of a " red wave . " given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party in western germany so far .
the social democrats have however repeatedly ruled out any federal coalition with the left party . outcome wide open but on monday , many german newspapers warned against reading too much into sunday 's election results . " interpreting this setback -lsb- for merkel -rsb- as a clear signal of a turnaround in the battle for berlin in four weeks is wide of the mark , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
business daily handelsblatt noted that " trying to predict the outcome of the federal election from sunday 's results is about as reliable as reading tea leaves .

merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 31.08.2009 in turnaround , muslim author to receive german culture prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some took offense at author kermani 's look at the cross an ongoing controversy over a german culture prize has been resolved .
an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but offenders will be given a one-off chance to come clean with the taxman . french budget minister eric woerth revealed in a weekend interview that paris had obtained the names of 3,000 french taxpayers holding assets worth about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in three swiss banks . woerth told the journal du dimanche newspaper that at least some of names listed " very probably " belonged to tax evaders .
he said they would be given until dec .
31 to pay any overdue taxes or would face a full tax audit . " we are not bluffing .
we have a list of 3,000 names , " woerth told france 's radio classique on monday , although he said the government would not publicly name the banks nor the individuals concerned . left-wing opposition leaders in france have accused president nicolas sarkozy 's right-wing government of planning a mass amnesty for tax evaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader martine aubry says the tax evaders should be prosecuted immediately " the government says , ' we have names ' well , those people should be chased down , taxed , made to pay a penalty and taken to court , " socialist leader martine aubry told france info radio . " why give them until the end of the year to quietly settle up ? " she asked .
" when ordinary french people fail to pay their gas bill , they face a penalty .
the rules should apply to all . " but woerth denied that offenders would be let off the hook . " of course there is no amnesty , " he said .
" when i call on people to square their situation with the authorities , that means they will pay tax .
an amnesty is to pay no taxes , or very low taxes , which is not the case .

they plan to try to get the rest of the eu on board before september 's g-20 meeting . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed to take a common approach regarding bankers ' bonus payments , following a meeting in berlin on monday . unbridled risk-taking by some bankers has often been cited as one of the main factors that led to the global financial crisis , and the incentive of lucrative bonus payments has often been blamed for stoking bankers ' willingness to take chances . " the international community needs to understand that the excesses of speculation and financial -lrb- institutions -rrb- which led to the crisis can not resume as though nothing had happened , " sarkozy said in berlin . merkel reiterated demands for international regulations that would keep the size of global banks in check . " no bank can be allowed to become so big that it is in a position to blackmail governments , " she said . merkel and sarkozy have also called on the european union to adopt a common stance before the two-day g-20 meeting , which is to be held in the us city of pittsburgh beginning on september 24 . global regulations a tough sell despite berlin and paris both coming out in clear support of international bank regulations as a way of preventing any future global financial crisis from happening , getting the rest of the g-20 nations to accept these terms is another story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance expert wolfgang gerke says it is critical for banking regulations to be applied worldwide " you need the acceptance of all of the g-20 countries , especially the united states and great britain , " wolfgang gerke , president of the bavarian center of finance , told deutsche welle .

and therefore they are for continuing the system they had for many years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 31.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's chances are still good , despite lost ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state ballots in saarland , saxony and thuringia show the christian democrats losing ground , the spd still weak and smaller parties gaining votes .
dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .
unfortunately , it was the first time the neo-nazi party was able to re-enter the state parliament , signalling that the danger of having a disastrous " brown " faction in germany 's parliament is not out of the question .

it was reportedly similar to the official exit poll results broadcast on public broadcasters ard and zdf at 6 pm german time .
“ this is damaging democracy , ” wolfgang bosbach , of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the cologne daily koelner stadt-anzeiger .
“ there is the danger that election results could be falsified .
therefore , these exit polls must be strictly monitored . ”
joerg van essen of the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- described the tweets as " unacceptable . "
a criminal offense joerg schoenenborn , editor-in-chief for public broadcaster wdr , the station responsible for providing election results to other public broadcasters , insisted that the station did not leak the numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are up in arms over the exit poll tweets “ the claim that the data from our election researchers was posted to the web first is wrong , ” he said .
“ i looked into the numbers and found no similarities with our internal data , which we had in the afternoon . ”
releasing election results before polling stations close is a criminal offense in germany , punishable by fines of up to 50,000 euros .
officials may reportedly move to ban exit polls in order to keep election results out of the social media .
the results could face a legal challenge and be declared null and void , according to ralf burmester , a media lawyer based in hamburg .
" whether it 's a pamphlet , twitter , or on the radio , it is forbidden to publish results before polls close because there is always the danger of voter manipulation , " burmester told news agency dpa .
officials worried about leaks in federal polls with the federal elections coming up on september 27 , authorities worry that leaks on social networking sites like twitter and facebook could influence poll results .
germany 's federal election commissioner , roderich egeler warned of a similar breach of the law during the general election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egeler wants to avoid a repitition of the incident during federal elections " i urge all election research institutes who conduct exit polls to be extremely restrictive in how they handle the results , " egeler said in a statement in wiesbaden .
it 's not the first time in germany that election results have broken first on twitter .

french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .
for president sarkozy , only too aware of public opinion , the bonus issue provides another chance to take a lead on the world stage .
one prominent economist believes the pittsburgh summit will be the last window of opportunity for reform .
" next year we could expect a mild rebound in the economy , " said christian de boissieu of the sorbonne university .
" i think the appetite for global reform is going to diminish .
pittsburgh is perhaps the last chance to draw together the main implications of this crisis . "
the last g-20 summit in london in april set out broad principles for world banks .
pittsburgh will now see a french-led drive to enforce tougher restrictions .
in the words of one french banker , they have been set the speed limits - now come the radar traps . report : alasdair sandford , paris editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , the climate will continue to change , " gro harlem brundtland , the united nations secretary-general 's special envoy on climate change , said on monday .
" all countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate . " but the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms , rising sea levels , droughts , and famine , but how the information is used , according to wmo secretary-general michel jarraud . " the problem is that much information on the climate is not used properly , " jarraud told reporters .
" it 's time to link technology and science with decision makers . " climate justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan said rich countries should make the biggest emissions cuts the conference comes before world leaders and delegates are set to meet in copenhagen in december in an effort to agree on a binding deal that would curb global warming before the kyoto protocol , the current compromise on reducing greenhouse gases , runs out in 2012 . former un secretary-general kofi annan told delegates in geneva that climate agreements had to be " radical , universal and binding " and have " climate justice at its heart . " annan said the people most affected by climate change were the poorest and least developed nations that contributed the least to pollution . " the most advanced economies must take the lead by taking the most drastic -lrb- emissions -rrb- cuts , " the former un head said , while urging countries to share weather information and cooperate on climate issues . better data for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians need good data as the basis of their decisions , jarraud said climate change is already underway and will continue regardless of any compromises made at major climate negotiations , jarraud added . " even if copenhagen is successful on greenhouse gases , a certain warming -lrb- of the planet -rrb- will occur , " he said , adding that improved knowledge of the climate could help manage water and food needs , in addition to preserving the environment . jarraud gave the examples of malaria and cholera , two potentially fatal diseases that spread in certain climate conditions .
better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur . " we need to anticipate change , we can no longer base ourselves on the past to take decisions for the future , " he told journalists . the information can also help reduce costs and benefit sectors of the economy , such as tourism . " climate change is here now and countries need tools to adapt to the changing climate , " the wmo wrote in its invitation to the world climate conference . the meeting of representatives from some 80 nations is the third world climate conference .
the first took place in 1979 and the second in 1990 .

" the international community needs to understand that the excesses of speculation and financial -lrb- institutions -rrb- which led to the crisis can not resume as though nothing had happened , " sarkozy said in berlin . merkel reiterated demands for international regulations that would keep the size of global banks in check . " no bank can be allowed to become so big that it is in a position to blackmail governments , " she said . merkel and sarkozy have also called on the european union to adopt a common stance before the two-day g-20 meeting , which is to be held in the us city of pittsburgh beginning on september 24 . global regulations a tough sell despite berlin and paris both coming out in clear support of international bank regulations as a way of preventing any future global financial crisis from happening , getting the rest of the g-20 nations to accept these terms is another story .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 31.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's chances are still good , despite lost ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state ballots in saarland , saxony and thuringia show the christian democrats losing ground , the spd still weak and smaller parties gaining votes .
dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .
unfortunately , it was the first time the neo-nazi party was able to re-enter the state parliament , signalling that the danger of having a disastrous " brown " faction in germany 's parliament is not out of the question .

dw-world.de merkel remains optimistic about party 's chances despite heavy losses just four weeks before the german general election , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats suffered substantial losses in two out of three state ballots on sunday .

dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 31.08.2009 in turnaround , muslim author to receive german culture prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some took offense at author kermani 's look at the cross an ongoing controversy over a german culture prize has been resolved .
an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

the move comes after almost a century of hostility between the neighboring countries . a spokesman for the turkish foreign ministry , burak ozugerin , told news agency ap that the talks leading to agreements for setting up and developing relations between the two countries should last up to six weeks .
in a joint statement , the foreign ministries of turkey , armenia and switzerland confirmed the six-week timeframe .

" both sides will make their best efforts for the timely progression of the ratification in line with their constitutional and legal procedures . "
decades-long hostility in april of this year , armenia and turkey said they had agreed on a roadmap to normalize bilateral ties after decades of tense relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 31.08.2009 sarkozy to launch global challenge to bank bonus culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy wants the banking sector to clean up its act french president nicolas sarkozy 's visit to berlin aims to find common ground between germany and france ahead of the g-20 summit in pittsburgh , where paris will push for global rules limiting rewards for traders . nicolas sarkozy intends to lobby other world leaders in a bid to rein in large bonus payments in the banking world .
french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .
for president sarkozy , only too aware of public opinion , the bonus issue provides another chance to take a lead on the world stage .
one prominent economist believes the pittsburgh summit will be the last window of opportunity for reform .
" next year we could expect a mild rebound in the economy , " said christian de boissieu of the sorbonne university .
" i think the appetite for global reform is going to diminish .
pittsburgh is perhaps the last chance to draw together the main implications of this crisis . "
the last g-20 summit in london in april set out broad principles for world banks .
pittsburgh will now see a french-led drive to enforce tougher restrictions .
in the words of one french banker , they have been set the speed limits - now come the radar traps . report : alasdair sandford , paris editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have been locked in a bitter dispute over the mass killings of hundreds of thousands of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenians have campaigned for the killings to be recognized internationally as genocide - and some countries have done so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 31.08.2009 sarkozy to launch global challenge to bank bonus culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy wants the banking sector to clean up its act french president nicolas sarkozy 's visit to berlin aims to find common ground between germany and france ahead of the g-20 summit in pittsburgh , where paris will push for global rules limiting rewards for traders . nicolas sarkozy intends to lobby other world leaders in a bid to rein in large bonus payments in the banking world .
french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .
for president sarkozy , only too aware of public opinion , the bonus issue provides another chance to take a lead on the world stage .
one prominent economist believes the pittsburgh summit will be the last window of opportunity for reform .
" next year we could expect a mild rebound in the economy , " said christian de boissieu of the sorbonne university .
" i think the appetite for global reform is going to diminish .
pittsburgh is perhaps the last chance to draw together the main implications of this crisis . "
the last g-20 summit in london in april set out broad principles for world banks .
pittsburgh will now see a french-led drive to enforce tougher restrictions .
in the words of one french banker , they have been set the speed limits - now come the radar traps . report : alasdair sandford , paris editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .

his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 31.08.2009 sarkozy to launch global challenge to bank bonus culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy wants the banking sector to clean up its act french president nicolas sarkozy 's visit to berlin aims to find common ground between germany and france ahead of the g-20 summit in pittsburgh , where paris will push for global rules limiting rewards for traders . nicolas sarkozy intends to lobby other world leaders in a bid to rein in large bonus payments in the banking world .
french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 31.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's chances are still good , despite lost ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state ballots in saarland , saxony and thuringia show the christian democrats losing ground , the spd still weak and smaller parties gaining votes .
dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .
unfortunately , it was the first time the neo-nazi party was able to re-enter the state parliament , signalling that the danger of having a disastrous " brown " faction in germany 's parliament is not out of the question .

dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .
unfortunately , it was the first time the neo-nazi party was able to re-enter the state parliament , signalling that the danger of having a disastrous " brown " faction in germany 's parliament is not out of the question .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university , said .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " alliance with the left not easy for spd but the spd still faces a tough task of turning around its dismal ratings .
merkel 's party still leads by a large margin in opinion polls . the left party , descendants of the former ruling party of communist east germany , and the fdp , were sunday 's biggest winners . but any state cooperation between the spd , the green party and the left party - descendants of the ruling party of former communist east germany - could be targeted by the conservatives to warn of a " red wave . " given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party in western germany so far .
the social democrats have however repeatedly ruled out any federal coalition with the left party . outcome wide open but on monday , many german newspapers warned against reading too much into sunday 's election results .

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

but offenders will be given a one-off chance to come clean with the taxman . french budget minister eric woerth revealed in a weekend interview that paris had obtained the names of 3,000 french taxpayers holding assets worth about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in three swiss banks . woerth told the journal du dimanche newspaper that at least some of names listed " very probably " belonged to tax evaders .
he said they would be given until dec .
31 to pay any overdue taxes or would face a full tax audit . " we are not bluffing .
we have a list of 3,000 names , " woerth told france 's radio classique on monday , although he said the government would not publicly name the banks nor the individuals concerned . left-wing opposition leaders in france have accused president nicolas sarkozy 's right-wing government of planning a mass amnesty for tax evaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader martine aubry says the tax evaders should be prosecuted immediately " the government says , ' we have names ' well , those people should be chased down , taxed , made to pay a penalty and taken to court , " socialist leader martine aubry told france info radio . " why give them until the end of the year to quietly settle up ? " she asked .
" when ordinary french people fail to pay their gas bill , they face a penalty .
the rules should apply to all . " but woerth denied that offenders would be let off the hook . " of course there is no amnesty , " he said .
" when i call on people to square their situation with the authorities , that means they will pay tax .
an amnesty is to pay no taxes , or very low taxes , which is not the case . " swiss silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some swiss officials said they did n't know about tax data sent the to the french woerth said most of the names on the list were obtained from the swiss tax authorities , while others were sourced directly from the banking establishments concerned . swiss authorities , however , said they were unaware of any bank data being transferred to france . swiss president hans-rudolf merz declined to answer reporters ' questions when exiting a climate change conference in geneva .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 31.08.2009 in turnaround , muslim author to receive german culture prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some took offense at author kermani 's look at the cross an ongoing controversy over a german culture prize has been resolved .
an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after almost a century of hostility between the neighboring countries . a spokesman for the turkish foreign ministry , burak ozugerin , told news agency ap that the talks leading to agreements for setting up and developing relations between the two countries should last up to six weeks .
in a joint statement , the foreign ministries of turkey , armenia and switzerland confirmed the six-week timeframe .
" the political consultations will be completed within six weeks , following which the two protocols will be signed and submitted to the respective parliaments for the ratification on each side , " it said .
" both sides will make their best efforts for the timely progression of the ratification in line with their constitutional and legal procedures . "
decades-long hostility in april of this year , armenia and turkey said they had agreed on a roadmap to normalize bilateral ties after decades of tense relations .
at the time the two countries announced in a joint statement that they had agreed to " develop good neighborly relations in mutual respect and progress peace , security and stability in the entire region . "
turkey and armenia have had no diplomatic ties since armenia became independent from the soviet union in 1991 .
the two neighbors have a history of mutual distrust .
they have been locked in a bitter dispute over the mass killings of hundreds of thousands of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenians have campaigned for the killings to be recognized internationally as genocide - and some countries have done so .
but turkey has condemned widespread efforts to have them defined as genocide. sp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the cdu still remains the largest party in both states .
" the vote losses in thuringia and saarland are painful , " cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said sunday after the polls closed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland premier peter mueller will likely lose his job after his cdu party lost heavily the losses at the state level could be a blow for chancellor angela merkel , who 's campaigning for a second term in federal elections to be held september 27 .
merkel 's party looks likely to only hold onto the former east german state of saxony , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich . " the saxons have voted wisely , " tillich said sunday evening .
" i accept this responsibility with gratitude but also with respect for the will of the voters . " red-red-green coalitions possible next door in thuringia , incumbent cdu premier dieter althaus could lose office after his party drew only about 31 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent five years ago . althaus saw his popularity dip after he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for crashing into and killing a 41-year-old woman on a ski slope in austria on new year 's day . he could form a coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , mirroring the current national government .
alternatively , a coalition between the spd , the far-left left party and the environmentalist green party is also possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher compared to the last election in thuringia and the saarland in the western german state of saarland , the cdu had ruled alone after pulling in 47.5 percent of the vote in 2004 .
projections from sunday 's election say the party will receive just 35 percent of the vote , which could lead to an spd , left party , green coalition as in thuringia . if the left party enters a coalition in the saarland , it would be the first time the party , which is composed of former east german communists and disaffected former sdp members , joins a government in western germany . given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party .

the move comes after almost a century of hostility between the neighboring countries . a spokesman for the turkish foreign ministry , burak ozugerin , told news agency ap that the talks leading to agreements for setting up and developing relations between the two countries should last up to six weeks .
in a joint statement , the foreign ministries of turkey , armenia and switzerland confirmed the six-week timeframe .
" the political consultations will be completed within six weeks , following which the two protocols will be signed and submitted to the respective parliaments for the ratification on each side , " it said .
" both sides will make their best efforts for the timely progression of the ratification in line with their constitutional and legal procedures . "
decades-long hostility in april of this year , armenia and turkey said they had agreed on a roadmap to normalize bilateral ties after decades of tense relations .
at the time the two countries announced in a joint statement that they had agreed to " develop good neighborly relations in mutual respect and progress peace , security and stability in the entire region . "
turkey and armenia have had no diplomatic ties since armenia became independent from the soviet union in 1991 .
the two neighbors have a history of mutual distrust .
they have been locked in a bitter dispute over the mass killings of hundreds of thousands of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenians have campaigned for the killings to be recognized internationally as genocide - and some countries have done so .
but turkey has condemned widespread efforts to have them defined as genocide. sp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these planned power outages due to a lack in capacity affect the whole country and are called " load shedding " .
industries have stopped working due to electricity shortages , leading to a loss in the production .
this again means that people are thrown out of jobs .
saheed farhaz , the owner of nafisa textiles in lahore says , " i am facing 5 to 8 hours of load shedding a day now .
i have to pay the labour charges and other input costs , so definitely the result will be a huge loss .
so power is a big issue here . "
not only for the industrial sector , also for common men and women .
without air condition or fans , the heat becomes unbearable .
a karachi resident complains , " as a common pakistani , i am suffering a lot because of this power shortage .
unfortunately , i am unable to go on with my daily routine and can not even reach office on time due to the long power breaks at night . "
capacity shortages pakistan failed to implement long-needed power projects during the economic boom between 2002 and 2007 .
although the government has now approved the 4,500 megawatt diamer-bhasa dam project and other hydropower projects to overcome the energy crisis , experts think a short term plan is in need .
professor abid a. burki from the lahore university of management sciences says : " for example we have sugar mills and other manufacturing units who have surplus electricity and you need to devise a mechanism how that electricity can be brought into the main system .
secondly , pakistan possesses the third largest coal reserves in the world and it is about time that the policy makers seriously consider the potential to generate electricity through coal .
and finally , the policy makers in pakistan must start popularising energy use efficiency simply by raising awareness . "
outsourcing power generation while the government has taken up a temporary plan of outsourcing power generation to private so-called rental power plants , burki thinks this solution is too expensive , as they tend to charge more for the electricity .
" this is a double edged sword " , says burki .
" because letting a shortfall in electricity persist would contribute to a slowdown in the growth rate of pakistan 's economy ; on the other hand , achieving self-sufficiency by involving these rental power plants might again lead to a slowdown in the growth rate because the cost of electricity would shoot up . "
experts believe it is high time that a stable policy is implemented to solve the problem .
otherwise , the widespread agitations and protests against the power crisis all over pakistan will destabilize the country further and hamper its focus on fighting militancy and terrorism .

these planned power outages due to a lack in capacity affect the whole country and are called " load shedding " .
industries have stopped working due to electricity shortages , leading to a loss in the production .
this again means that people are thrown out of jobs .
saheed farhaz , the owner of nafisa textiles in lahore says , " i am facing 5 to 8 hours of load shedding a day now .
i have to pay the labour charges and other input costs , so definitely the result will be a huge loss .
so power is a big issue here . "
not only for the industrial sector , also for common men and women .
without air condition or fans , the heat becomes unbearable .
a karachi resident complains , " as a common pakistani , i am suffering a lot because of this power shortage .
unfortunately , i am unable to go on with my daily routine and can not even reach office on time due to the long power breaks at night . "
capacity shortages pakistan failed to implement long-needed power projects during the economic boom between 2002 and 2007 .
although the government has now approved the 4,500 megawatt diamer-bhasa dam project and other hydropower projects to overcome the energy crisis , experts think a short term plan is in need .
professor abid a. burki from the lahore university of management sciences says : " for example we have sugar mills and other manufacturing units who have surplus electricity and you need to devise a mechanism how that electricity can be brought into the main system .
secondly , pakistan possesses the third largest coal reserves in the world and it is about time that the policy makers seriously consider the potential to generate electricity through coal .
and finally , the policy makers in pakistan must start popularising energy use efficiency simply by raising awareness . "
outsourcing power generation while the government has taken up a temporary plan of outsourcing power generation to private so-called rental power plants , burki thinks this solution is too expensive , as they tend to charge more for the electricity .
" this is a double edged sword " , says burki .
" because letting a shortfall in electricity persist would contribute to a slowdown in the growth rate of pakistan 's economy ; on the other hand , achieving self-sufficiency by involving these rental power plants might again lead to a slowdown in the growth rate because the cost of electricity would shoot up . "
experts believe it is high time that a stable policy is implemented to solve the problem .
otherwise , the widespread agitations and protests against the power crisis all over pakistan will destabilize the country further and hamper its focus on fighting militancy and terrorism .

these planned power outages due to a lack in capacity affect the whole country and are called " load shedding " .
industries have stopped working due to electricity shortages , leading to a loss in the production .
this again means that people are thrown out of jobs .
saheed farhaz , the owner of nafisa textiles in lahore says , " i am facing 5 to 8 hours of load shedding a day now .
i have to pay the labour charges and other input costs , so definitely the result will be a huge loss .
so power is a big issue here . "
not only for the industrial sector , also for common men and women .
without air condition or fans , the heat becomes unbearable .
a karachi resident complains , " as a common pakistani , i am suffering a lot because of this power shortage .
unfortunately , i am unable to go on with my daily routine and can not even reach office on time due to the long power breaks at night . "
capacity shortages pakistan failed to implement long-needed power projects during the economic boom between 2002 and 2007 .
although the government has now approved the 4,500 megawatt diamer-bhasa dam project and other hydropower projects to overcome the energy crisis , experts think a short term plan is in need .
professor abid a. burki from the lahore university of management sciences says : " for example we have sugar mills and other manufacturing units who have surplus electricity and you need to devise a mechanism how that electricity can be brought into the main system .
secondly , pakistan possesses the third largest coal reserves in the world and it is about time that the policy makers seriously consider the potential to generate electricity through coal .
and finally , the policy makers in pakistan must start popularising energy use efficiency simply by raising awareness . "
outsourcing power generation while the government has taken up a temporary plan of outsourcing power generation to private so-called rental power plants , burki thinks this solution is too expensive , as they tend to charge more for the electricity .
" this is a double edged sword " , says burki .
" because letting a shortfall in electricity persist would contribute to a slowdown in the growth rate of pakistan 's economy ; on the other hand , achieving self-sufficiency by involving these rental power plants might again lead to a slowdown in the growth rate because the cost of electricity would shoot up . "
experts believe it is high time that a stable policy is implemented to solve the problem .
otherwise , the widespread agitations and protests against the power crisis all over pakistan will destabilize the country further and hamper its focus on fighting militancy and terrorism .

a karachi resident complains , " as a common pakistani , i am suffering a lot because of this power shortage .
unfortunately , i am unable to go on with my daily routine and can not even reach office on time due to the long power breaks at night . "
capacity shortages pakistan failed to implement long-needed power projects during the economic boom between 2002 and 2007 .
although the government has now approved the 4,500 megawatt diamer-bhasa dam project and other hydropower projects to overcome the energy crisis , experts think a short term plan is in need .
professor abid a. burki from the lahore university of management sciences says : " for example we have sugar mills and other manufacturing units who have surplus electricity and you need to devise a mechanism how that electricity can be brought into the main system .
secondly , pakistan possesses the third largest coal reserves in the world and it is about time that the policy makers seriously consider the potential to generate electricity through coal .
and finally , the policy makers in pakistan must start popularising energy use efficiency simply by raising awareness . "
outsourcing power generation while the government has taken up a temporary plan of outsourcing power generation to private so-called rental power plants , burki thinks this solution is too expensive , as they tend to charge more for the electricity .
" this is a double edged sword " , says burki .
" because letting a shortfall in electricity persist would contribute to a slowdown in the growth rate of pakistan 's economy ; on the other hand , achieving self-sufficiency by involving these rental power plants might again lead to a slowdown in the growth rate because the cost of electricity would shoot up . "
experts believe it is high time that a stable policy is implemented to solve the problem .
otherwise , the widespread agitations and protests against the power crisis all over pakistan will destabilize the country further and hamper its focus on fighting militancy and terrorism .

the move comes after almost a century of hostility between the neighboring countries . a spokesman for the turkish foreign ministry , burak ozugerin , told news agency ap that the talks leading to agreements for setting up and developing relations between the two countries should last up to six weeks .
in a joint statement , the foreign ministries of turkey , armenia and switzerland confirmed the six-week timeframe .
" the political consultations will be completed within six weeks , following which the two protocols will be signed and submitted to the respective parliaments for the ratification on each side , " it said .
" both sides will make their best efforts for the timely progression of the ratification in line with their constitutional and legal procedures . "
decades-long hostility in april of this year , armenia and turkey said they had agreed on a roadmap to normalize bilateral ties after decades of tense relations .
at the time the two countries announced in a joint statement that they had agreed to " develop good neighborly relations in mutual respect and progress peace , security and stability in the entire region . "
turkey and armenia have had no diplomatic ties since armenia became independent from the soviet union in 1991 .
the two neighbors have a history of mutual distrust .
they have been locked in a bitter dispute over the mass killings of hundreds of thousands of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenians have campaigned for the killings to be recognized internationally as genocide - and some countries have done so .
but turkey has condemned widespread efforts to have them defined as genocide. sp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .

dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .
unfortunately , it was the first time the neo-nazi party was able to re-enter the state parliament , signalling that the danger of having a disastrous " brown " faction in germany 's parliament is not out of the question .

french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "

some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .

france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .

french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .
for president sarkozy , only too aware of public opinion , the bonus issue provides another chance to take a lead on the world stage .
one prominent economist believes the pittsburgh summit will be the last window of opportunity for reform .
" next year we could expect a mild rebound in the economy , " said christian de boissieu of the sorbonne university .
" i think the appetite for global reform is going to diminish .
pittsburgh is perhaps the last chance to draw together the main implications of this crisis . "
the last g-20 summit in london in april set out broad principles for world banks .

" even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , the climate will continue to change , " gro harlem brundtland , the united nations secretary-general 's special envoy on climate change , said on monday .
" all countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate . " but the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms , rising sea levels , droughts , and famine , but how the information is used , according to wmo secretary-general michel jarraud . " the problem is that much information on the climate is not used properly , " jarraud told reporters .
" it 's time to link technology and science with decision makers . " climate justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan said rich countries should make the biggest emissions cuts the conference comes before world leaders and delegates are set to meet in copenhagen in december in an effort to agree on a binding deal that would curb global warming before the kyoto protocol , the current compromise on reducing greenhouse gases , runs out in 2012 . former un secretary-general kofi annan told delegates in geneva that climate agreements had to be " radical , universal and binding " and have " climate justice at its heart . " annan said the people most affected by climate change were the poorest and least developed nations that contributed the least to pollution . " the most advanced economies must take the lead by taking the most drastic -lrb- emissions -rrb- cuts , " the former un head said , while urging countries to share weather information and cooperate on climate issues . better data for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians need good data as the basis of their decisions , jarraud said climate change is already underway and will continue regardless of any compromises made at major climate negotiations , jarraud added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 31.08.2009 in turnaround , muslim author to receive german culture prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some took offense at author kermani 's look at the cross an ongoing controversy over a german culture prize has been resolved .
an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "

kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes after almost a century of hostility between the neighboring countries . a spokesman for the turkish foreign ministry , burak ozugerin , told news agency ap that the talks leading to agreements for setting up and developing relations between the two countries should last up to six weeks .
in a joint statement , the foreign ministries of turkey , armenia and switzerland confirmed the six-week timeframe .
" the political consultations will be completed within six weeks , following which the two protocols will be signed and submitted to the respective parliaments for the ratification on each side , " it said .
" both sides will make their best efforts for the timely progression of the ratification in line with their constitutional and legal procedures . "
decades-long hostility in april of this year , armenia and turkey said they had agreed on a roadmap to normalize bilateral ties after decades of tense relations .
at the time the two countries announced in a joint statement that they had agreed to " develop good neighborly relations in mutual respect and progress peace , security and stability in the entire region . "
turkey and armenia have had no diplomatic ties since armenia became independent from the soviet union in 1991 .
the two neighbors have a history of mutual distrust .
they have been locked in a bitter dispute over the mass killings of hundreds of thousands of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .
armenians have campaigned for the killings to be recognized internationally as genocide - and some countries have done so .
but turkey has condemned widespread efforts to have them defined as genocide. sp / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.08.2009 merkel 's cdu party experiences setback in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of merkel 's cdu party are disappointed with the results in saarland and thuringia just a month before national elections , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats suffered losses in two out of three state elections , while the left-wing left party and the liberal free democrats gained ground . the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- seems likely to lose control of governments in saarland and thuringia after state elections sunday , according to projections from the ard and zdf public television networks .
but the cdu still remains the largest party in both states .
" the vote losses in thuringia and saarland are painful , " cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said sunday after the polls closed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland premier peter mueller will likely lose his job after his cdu party lost heavily the losses at the state level could be a blow for chancellor angela merkel , who 's campaigning for a second term in federal elections to be held september 27 .
merkel 's party looks likely to only hold onto the former east german state of saxony , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich . " the saxons have voted wisely , " tillich said sunday evening .
" i accept this responsibility with gratitude but also with respect for the will of the voters . " red-red-green coalitions possible next door in thuringia , incumbent cdu premier dieter althaus could lose office after his party drew only about 31 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent five years ago . althaus saw his popularity dip after he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for crashing into and killing a 41-year-old woman on a ski slope in austria on new year 's day . he could form a coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , mirroring the current national government .
alternatively , a coalition between the spd , the far-left left party and the environmentalist green party is also possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher compared to the last election in thuringia and the saarland in the western german state of saarland , the cdu had ruled alone after pulling in 47.5 percent of the vote in 2004 .
projections from sunday 's election say the party will receive just 35 percent of the vote , which could lead to an spd , left party , green coalition as in thuringia . if the left party enters a coalition in the saarland , it would be the first time the party , which is composed of former east german communists and disaffected former sdp members , joins a government in western germany . given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party .
in order to reassure potential voters ahead of next month 's national election , spd head franz muenterfering ruled out sunday night an alliance between the two parties on the national level . social democrats breathe a small sigh of relief sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the spd , which has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the saxon government , the party seems likely to gain power in saarland and thuringia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's steinmeier spoke of a " good election sunday " " i have heard many time in the last few weeks that the federal election is over .
this evening shows that that was wrong , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , said . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " said karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " merkel 's preferred coalition partner , the pro-market free democratic party also made gains sunday .
saxon premier tillich is likely to form a coalition with the free democrats after projections showed the party pulling in over 10 percent of the vote .
but a cdu-fdp coalition was blocked in the other two states holding polls sunday . " we 're the winners of this evening , " fdp chief guido westerwelle said on sunday evening .
he said the results , which may lead to left-leaning coalitions in thuringia and the saarland , should be considered " a warning shot for the entire republic . " the far-right extremist npd party failed to gain seats in the thuringia parliament .
the npd , which is under surveillance for its anti-immigrant message , managed to hold onto its seats in the saxon parliament , though its share fell to about 5 percent , down from over 9 percent five years ago . author : bn / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de left party makes big inroads in state elections nearly 20 years after the fall of berlin wall , the former ruling party of east germany made big gains in sunday 's regional elections and is poised to enter governments in both halves of the country .

but the cdu still remains the largest party in both states .
" the vote losses in thuringia and saarland are painful , " cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said sunday after the polls closed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland premier peter mueller will likely lose his job after his cdu party lost heavily the losses at the state level could be a blow for chancellor angela merkel , who 's campaigning for a second term in federal elections to be held september 27 .
merkel 's party looks likely to only hold onto the former east german state of saxony , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich . " the saxons have voted wisely , " tillich said sunday evening .
" i accept this responsibility with gratitude but also with respect for the will of the voters . " red-red-green coalitions possible next door in thuringia , incumbent cdu premier dieter althaus could lose office after his party drew only about 31 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent five years ago . althaus saw his popularity dip after he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for crashing into and killing a 41-year-old woman on a ski slope in austria on new year 's day . he could form a coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , mirroring the current national government .
alternatively , a coalition between the spd , the far-left left party and the environmentalist green party is also possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher compared to the last election in thuringia and the saarland in the western german state of saarland , the cdu had ruled alone after pulling in 47.5 percent of the vote in 2004 .
projections from sunday 's election say the party will receive just 35 percent of the vote , which could lead to an spd , left party , green coalition as in thuringia . if the left party enters a coalition in the saarland , it would be the first time the party , which is composed of former east german communists and disaffected former sdp members , joins a government in western germany . given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party .
in order to reassure potential voters ahead of next month 's national election , spd head franz muenterfering ruled out sunday night an alliance between the two parties on the national level . social democrats breathe a small sigh of relief sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the spd , which has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the saxon government , the party seems likely to gain power in saarland and thuringia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's steinmeier spoke of a " good election sunday " " i have heard many time in the last few weeks that the federal election is over .
this evening shows that that was wrong , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , said . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " said karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " merkel 's preferred coalition partner , the pro-market free democratic party also made gains sunday .
saxon premier tillich is likely to form a coalition with the free democrats after projections showed the party pulling in over 10 percent of the vote .
but a cdu-fdp coalition was blocked in the other two states holding polls sunday . " we 're the winners of this evening , " fdp chief guido westerwelle said on sunday evening .
he said the results , which may lead to left-leaning coalitions in thuringia and the saarland , should be considered " a warning shot for the entire republic . " the far-right extremist npd party failed to gain seats in the thuringia parliament .
the npd , which is under surveillance for its anti-immigrant message , managed to hold onto its seats in the saxon parliament , though its share fell to about 5 percent , down from over 9 percent five years ago . author : bn / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.08.2009 merkel 's cdu party experiences setback in state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of merkel 's cdu party are disappointed with the results in saarland and thuringia just a month before national elections , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats suffered losses in two out of three state elections , while the left-wing left party and the liberal free democrats gained ground . the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- seems likely to lose control of governments in saarland and thuringia after state elections sunday , according to projections from the ard and zdf public television networks .
but the cdu still remains the largest party in both states .
" the vote losses in thuringia and saarland are painful , " cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said sunday after the polls closed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland premier peter mueller will likely lose his job after his cdu party lost heavily the losses at the state level could be a blow for chancellor angela merkel , who 's campaigning for a second term in federal elections to be held september 27 .
merkel 's party looks likely to only hold onto the former east german state of saxony , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich . " the saxons have voted wisely , " tillich said sunday evening .
" i accept this responsibility with gratitude but also with respect for the will of the voters . " red-red-green coalitions possible next door in thuringia , incumbent cdu premier dieter althaus could lose office after his party drew only about 31 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent five years ago . althaus saw his popularity dip after he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for crashing into and killing a 41-year-old woman on a ski slope in austria on new year 's day . he could form a coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , mirroring the current national government .
alternatively , a coalition between the spd , the far-left left party and the environmentalist green party is also possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher compared to the last election in thuringia and the saarland in the western german state of saarland , the cdu had ruled alone after pulling in 47.5 percent of the vote in 2004 .
projections from sunday 's election say the party will receive just 35 percent of the vote , which could lead to an spd , left party , green coalition as in thuringia . if the left party enters a coalition in the saarland , it would be the first time the party , which is composed of former east german communists and disaffected former sdp members , joins a government in western germany . given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party .
in order to reassure potential voters ahead of next month 's national election , spd head franz muenterfering ruled out sunday night an alliance between the two parties on the national level . social democrats breathe a small sigh of relief sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the spd , which has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the saxon government , the party seems likely to gain power in saarland and thuringia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's steinmeier spoke of a " good election sunday " " i have heard many time in the last few weeks that the federal election is over .
this evening shows that that was wrong , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , said . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " said karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " merkel 's preferred coalition partner , the pro-market free democratic party also made gains sunday .
saxon premier tillich is likely to form a coalition with the free democrats after projections showed the party pulling in over 10 percent of the vote .
but a cdu-fdp coalition was blocked in the other two states holding polls sunday . " we 're the winners of this evening , " fdp chief guido westerwelle said on sunday evening .

but the cdu still remains the largest party in both states .
" the vote losses in thuringia and saarland are painful , " cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said sunday after the polls closed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland premier peter mueller will likely lose his job after his cdu party lost heavily the losses at the state level could be a blow for chancellor angela merkel , who 's campaigning for a second term in federal elections to be held september 27 .
merkel 's party looks likely to only hold onto the former east german state of saxony , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich . " the saxons have voted wisely , " tillich said sunday evening .
" i accept this responsibility with gratitude but also with respect for the will of the voters . " red-red-green coalitions possible next door in thuringia , incumbent cdu premier dieter althaus could lose office after his party drew only about 31 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent five years ago . althaus saw his popularity dip after he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for crashing into and killing a 41-year-old woman on a ski slope in austria on new year 's day . he could form a coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , mirroring the current national government .
alternatively , a coalition between the spd , the far-left left party and the environmentalist green party is also possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher compared to the last election in thuringia and the saarland in the western german state of saarland , the cdu had ruled alone after pulling in 47.5 percent of the vote in 2004 .
projections from sunday 's election say the party will receive just 35 percent of the vote , which could lead to an spd , left party , green coalition as in thuringia . if the left party enters a coalition in the saarland , it would be the first time the party , which is composed of former east german communists and disaffected former sdp members , joins a government in western germany . given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party .
in order to reassure potential voters ahead of next month 's national election , spd head franz muenterfering ruled out sunday night an alliance between the two parties on the national level . social democrats breathe a small sigh of relief sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the spd , which has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the saxon government , the party seems likely to gain power in saarland and thuringia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's steinmeier spoke of a " good election sunday " " i have heard many time in the last few weeks that the federal election is over .
this evening shows that that was wrong , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , said . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " said karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " merkel 's preferred coalition partner , the pro-market free democratic party also made gains sunday .
saxon premier tillich is likely to form a coalition with the free democrats after projections showed the party pulling in over 10 percent of the vote .

merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .

angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .

dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .
unfortunately , it was the first time the neo-nazi party was able to re-enter the state parliament , signalling that the danger of having a disastrous " brown " faction in germany 's parliament is not out of the question .

french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .
for president sarkozy , only too aware of public opinion , the bonus issue provides another chance to take a lead on the world stage .
one prominent economist believes the pittsburgh summit will be the last window of opportunity for reform .
" next year we could expect a mild rebound in the economy , " said christian de boissieu of the sorbonne university .
" i think the appetite for global reform is going to diminish .
pittsburgh is perhaps the last chance to draw together the main implications of this crisis . "
the last g-20 summit in london in april set out broad principles for world banks .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are up in arms over the exit poll tweets “ the claim that the data from our election researchers was posted to the web first is wrong , ” he said .
“ i looked into the numbers and found no similarities with our internal data , which we had in the afternoon . ”
releasing election results before polling stations close is a criminal offense in germany , punishable by fines of up to 50,000 euros .
officials may reportedly move to ban exit polls in order to keep election results out of the social media .
the results could face a legal challenge and be declared null and void , according to ralf burmester , a media lawyer based in hamburg .
" whether it 's a pamphlet , twitter , or on the radio , it is forbidden to publish results before polls close because there is always the danger of voter manipulation , " burmester told news agency dpa .
officials worried about leaks in federal polls with the federal elections coming up on september 27 , authorities worry that leaks on social networking sites like twitter and facebook could influence poll results .
germany 's federal election commissioner , roderich egeler warned of a similar breach of the law during the general election .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egeler wants to avoid a repitition of the incident during federal elections " i urge all election research institutes who conduct exit polls to be extremely restrictive in how they handle the results , " egeler said in a statement in wiesbaden .
it 's not the first time in germany that election results have broken first on twitter .
on may 23 this year , the outcome of the vote for president , which horst koehler won , were up on twitter before the speaker of parliament , norbert lammert , made the results public. sp / gb / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur .

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .

controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 31.08.2009 sarkozy to launch global challenge to bank bonus culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy wants the banking sector to clean up its act french president nicolas sarkozy 's visit to berlin aims to find common ground between germany and france ahead of the g-20 summit in pittsburgh , where paris will push for global rules limiting rewards for traders . nicolas sarkozy intends to lobby other world leaders in a bid to rein in large bonus payments in the banking world .
french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .
for president sarkozy , only too aware of public opinion , the bonus issue provides another chance to take a lead on the world stage .
one prominent economist believes the pittsburgh summit will be the last window of opportunity for reform .
" next year we could expect a mild rebound in the economy , " said christian de boissieu of the sorbonne university .
" i think the appetite for global reform is going to diminish .
pittsburgh is perhaps the last chance to draw together the main implications of this crisis . "
the last g-20 summit in london in april set out broad principles for world banks .
pittsburgh will now see a french-led drive to enforce tougher restrictions .
in the words of one french banker , they have been set the speed limits - now come the radar traps . report : alasdair sandford , paris editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , the climate will continue to change , " gro harlem brundtland , the united nations secretary-general 's special envoy on climate change , said on monday .
" all countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate . " but the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms , rising sea levels , droughts , and famine , but how the information is used , according to wmo secretary-general michel jarraud . " the problem is that much information on the climate is not used properly , " jarraud told reporters .
" it 's time to link technology and science with decision makers . " climate justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan said rich countries should make the biggest emissions cuts the conference comes before world leaders and delegates are set to meet in copenhagen in december in an effort to agree on a binding deal that would curb global warming before the kyoto protocol , the current compromise on reducing greenhouse gases , runs out in 2012 . former un secretary-general kofi annan told delegates in geneva that climate agreements had to be " radical , universal and binding " and have " climate justice at its heart . " annan said the people most affected by climate change were the poorest and least developed nations that contributed the least to pollution . " the most advanced economies must take the lead by taking the most drastic -lrb- emissions -rrb- cuts , " the former un head said , while urging countries to share weather information and cooperate on climate issues . better data for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians need good data as the basis of their decisions , jarraud said climate change is already underway and will continue regardless of any compromises made at major climate negotiations , jarraud added . " even if copenhagen is successful on greenhouse gases , a certain warming -lrb- of the planet -rrb- will occur , " he said , adding that improved knowledge of the climate could help manage water and food needs , in addition to preserving the environment . jarraud gave the examples of malaria and cholera , two potentially fatal diseases that spread in certain climate conditions .
better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur . " we need to anticipate change , we can no longer base ourselves on the past to take decisions for the future , " he told journalists . the information can also help reduce costs and benefit sectors of the economy , such as tourism .

merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university , said .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " alliance with the left not easy for spd but the spd still faces a tough task of turning around its dismal ratings .
merkel 's party still leads by a large margin in opinion polls . the left party , descendants of the former ruling party of communist east germany , and the fdp , were sunday 's biggest winners . but any state cooperation between the spd , the green party and the left party - descendants of the ruling party of former communist east germany - could be targeted by the conservatives to warn of a " red wave . " given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party in western germany so far .
the social democrats have however repeatedly ruled out any federal coalition with the left party . outcome wide open but on monday , many german newspapers warned against reading too much into sunday 's election results . " interpreting this setback -lsb- for merkel -rsb- as a clear signal of a turnaround in the battle for berlin in four weeks is wide of the mark , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
business daily handelsblatt noted that " trying to predict the outcome of the federal election from sunday 's results is about as reliable as reading tea leaves .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

they plan to try to get the rest of the eu on board before september 's g-20 meeting . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed to take a common approach regarding bankers ' bonus payments , following a meeting in berlin on monday . unbridled risk-taking by some bankers has often been cited as one of the main factors that led to the global financial crisis , and the incentive of lucrative bonus payments has often been blamed for stoking bankers ' willingness to take chances . " the international community needs to understand that the excesses of speculation and financial -lrb- institutions -rrb- which led to the crisis can not resume as though nothing had happened , " sarkozy said in berlin . merkel reiterated demands for international regulations that would keep the size of global banks in check . " no bank can be allowed to become so big that it is in a position to blackmail governments , " she said . merkel and sarkozy have also called on the european union to adopt a common stance before the two-day g-20 meeting , which is to be held in the us city of pittsburgh beginning on september 24 . global regulations a tough sell despite berlin and paris both coming out in clear support of international bank regulations as a way of preventing any future global financial crisis from happening , getting the rest of the g-20 nations to accept these terms is another story .

" they feel that their financial centers would suffer if there is too much regulation .
and therefore they are for continuing the system they had for many years . " he noted that in the absence of international standards countries that do have tough bonus regulations would be at a disadvantage compared to countries with looser regulations .

we have a list of 3,000 names , " woerth told france 's radio classique on monday , although he said the government would not publicly name the banks nor the individuals concerned . left-wing opposition leaders in france have accused president nicolas sarkozy 's right-wing government of planning a mass amnesty for tax evaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader martine aubry says the tax evaders should be prosecuted immediately " the government says , ' we have names ' well , those people should be chased down , taxed , made to pay a penalty and taken to court , " socialist leader martine aubry told france info radio . " why give them until the end of the year to quietly settle up ? " she asked .
" when ordinary french people fail to pay their gas bill , they face a penalty .
the rules should apply to all . " but woerth denied that offenders would be let off the hook . " of course there is no amnesty , " he said .
" when i call on people to square their situation with the authorities , that means they will pay tax .
an amnesty is to pay no taxes , or very low taxes , which is not the case . " swiss silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some swiss officials said they did n't know about tax data sent the to the french woerth said most of the names on the list were obtained from the swiss tax authorities , while others were sourced directly from the banking establishments concerned . swiss authorities , however , said they were unaware of any bank data being transferred to france . swiss president hans-rudolf merz declined to answer reporters ' questions when exiting a climate change conference in geneva .
a spokesman for the finance ministry in bern was unavailable for comment . " we did not have any request from france about this matter , " an official at the swiss federal department of finance told german news agency dpa . new deals banking secrecy laws traditionally prohibit swiss banks from revealing information about their clients , except as part of a criminal investigation with the approval of authorities . while tax fraud is regarded as a crime in switzerland , tax evasion is generally treated only as a minor offence . but under a deal signed last week , switzerland agreed to offer france assistance on all tax offenses , in line with rules laid down by the organization for economic cooperation and development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president hans-rudolf merz says bern is not in the business of protecting criminals bern has negotiated similar agreements with a dozen nations , including japan , britain and the united states , in an effort to have itself removed from an oecd " grey list " of so-called tax havens .
while treaties with france , denmark and luxembourg have been finalized , most of the others are still awaiting ratification . switzerland 's largest bank , ubs has already handed over 250 names to us authorities and recently agreed to transfer data on at least 4,500 more accounts within a year as part of an out-of-court settlement .

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .

" even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , the climate will continue to change , " gro harlem brundtland , the united nations secretary-general 's special envoy on climate change , said on monday .
" all countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate . " but the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms , rising sea levels , droughts , and famine , but how the information is used , according to wmo secretary-general michel jarraud . " the problem is that much information on the climate is not used properly , " jarraud told reporters .
" it 's time to link technology and science with decision makers . " climate justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan said rich countries should make the biggest emissions cuts the conference comes before world leaders and delegates are set to meet in copenhagen in december in an effort to agree on a binding deal that would curb global warming before the kyoto protocol , the current compromise on reducing greenhouse gases , runs out in 2012 . former un secretary-general kofi annan told delegates in geneva that climate agreements had to be " radical , universal and binding " and have " climate justice at its heart . " annan said the people most affected by climate change were the poorest and least developed nations that contributed the least to pollution . " the most advanced economies must take the lead by taking the most drastic -lrb- emissions -rrb- cuts , " the former un head said , while urging countries to share weather information and cooperate on climate issues . better data for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians need good data as the basis of their decisions , jarraud said climate change is already underway and will continue regardless of any compromises made at major climate negotiations , jarraud added . " even if copenhagen is successful on greenhouse gases , a certain warming -lrb- of the planet -rrb- will occur , " he said , adding that improved knowledge of the climate could help manage water and food needs , in addition to preserving the environment . jarraud gave the examples of malaria and cholera , two potentially fatal diseases that spread in certain climate conditions .
better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur . " we need to anticipate change , we can no longer base ourselves on the past to take decisions for the future , " he told journalists . the information can also help reduce costs and benefit sectors of the economy , such as tourism . " climate change is here now and countries need tools to adapt to the changing climate , " the wmo wrote in its invitation to the world climate conference . the meeting of representatives from some 80 nations is the third world climate conference .
the first took place in 1979 and the second in 1990 .
those meetings are credited with leading to the creation of the intergovernmental panel on climate change , which won the 2007 nobel peace prize . sms / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .

the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .

on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .

" even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , the climate will continue to change , " gro harlem brundtland , the united nations secretary-general 's special envoy on climate change , said on monday .
" all countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate . " but the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms , rising sea levels , droughts , and famine , but how the information is used , according to wmo secretary-general michel jarraud . " the problem is that much information on the climate is not used properly , " jarraud told reporters .
" it 's time to link technology and science with decision makers . " climate justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan said rich countries should make the biggest emissions cuts the conference comes before world leaders and delegates are set to meet in copenhagen in december in an effort to agree on a binding deal that would curb global warming before the kyoto protocol , the current compromise on reducing greenhouse gases , runs out in 2012 . former un secretary-general kofi annan told delegates in geneva that climate agreements had to be " radical , universal and binding " and have " climate justice at its heart . " annan said the people most affected by climate change were the poorest and least developed nations that contributed the least to pollution . " the most advanced economies must take the lead by taking the most drastic -lrb- emissions -rrb- cuts , " the former un head said , while urging countries to share weather information and cooperate on climate issues . better data for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians need good data as the basis of their decisions , jarraud said climate change is already underway and will continue regardless of any compromises made at major climate negotiations , jarraud added . " even if copenhagen is successful on greenhouse gases , a certain warming -lrb- of the planet -rrb- will occur , " he said , adding that improved knowledge of the climate could help manage water and food needs , in addition to preserving the environment . jarraud gave the examples of malaria and cholera , two potentially fatal diseases that spread in certain climate conditions .
better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur . " we need to anticipate change , we can no longer base ourselves on the past to take decisions for the future , " he told journalists . the information can also help reduce costs and benefit sectors of the economy , such as tourism . " climate change is here now and countries need tools to adapt to the changing climate , " the wmo wrote in its invitation to the world climate conference . the meeting of representatives from some 80 nations is the third world climate conference .
the first took place in 1979 and the second in 1990 .
those meetings are credited with leading to the creation of the intergovernmental panel on climate change , which won the 2007 nobel peace prize . sms / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 31.08.2009 in turnaround , muslim author to receive german culture prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some took offense at author kermani 's look at the cross an ongoing controversy over a german culture prize has been resolved .
an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .
" muslims need to learn to be more relaxed and generous about these things too , " he added. jen / dpa / kna / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an islamic writer is set to get his part of an important award for intercultural understanding , despite initial opposition . a two-hour talk between all parties involved has led to a turning point in the decision over who will be awarded an important german culture prize .
the dispute over the 45,000-euro -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- hesse culture prize first broke out in may .
initially , the award was slated to go to four men from four different world religions - a catholic , a lutheran , a muslim and a jew - in honor of the value of religious dialogue .
controversial article but muslim author navid kermani was dropped from the quartet after he wrote an article that was critical of christian imagery of the crucifixion .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau , objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani had penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
kermani 's piece begins as an analysis of the painting , leading him into a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann was among those who were offended " i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry , " ' he writes .
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection . "
ongoing debate in response , lehmann and steinacker formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse , which had planned to award the prize on july 5 .
giving in to the pressure , the committee responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the issue did not die there , but continued to be debated in the media and among the general public .
the prize committee pushed back the awards ceremony to the autumn , hoping to give the four participants -lrb- the fourth being the head of the central council of jews in germany , salomon korn -rrb- time for a healing dialogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salomon korn had rejected an earlier muslim candidate indeed , the issue seems to have been resolved by a private talk , which took place last friday in mainz .
lehmann , steinacker and korn left the meeting saying kermani " should also get the prize , " according to a statement issued by the diocese of mainz released on friday evening .
the talk took place " without anyone else present , and covered all aspects of the controversy , " according to the statement .
the participants said that the atmosphere of the talks was respectful , open and objective .
muslims welcome ' late victory ' " this is exactly the development we were hoping for , " said dirk metz , a spokesman for the state of hesse .
the chairman of the central council of muslims in germany , axel ayyub koehler , welcomed the decision , telling the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that it was a " late victory for reason . "
however , he said , it would have been better " if the representatives of the church had had a less emotional response from the beginning . "
the conflict unleashed " a lot of hurt " in the muslim community , koehler said .

french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .

the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .

" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .

" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .

france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .
" i 've got copies of letters that are astounding .
relations between bankers and business leaders are no longer close . "
last year the banks agreed to try to increase loans by 3 percent .
but that was before the recession took hold .
they argue that if targets have not been met it is due to a reduction in demand .
" our loans to these companies have risen by 3.8 percent , that 's three times higher than the average , " argues georges pauget , chief executive of credit agricole .
" french banks are playing the game .
there may be occasional problems - but to say that french banks are n't committed is wrong . "
ready for the pittsburgh showdown in france , the gap between ordinary people and the banking world appears to be growing rather than diminishing .
for president sarkozy , only too aware of public opinion , the bonus issue provides another chance to take a lead on the world stage .
one prominent economist believes the pittsburgh summit will be the last window of opportunity for reform .
" next year we could expect a mild rebound in the economy , " said christian de boissieu of the sorbonne university .
" i think the appetite for global reform is going to diminish .
pittsburgh is perhaps the last chance to draw together the main implications of this crisis . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 31.08.2009 sarkozy to launch global challenge to bank bonus culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy wants the banking sector to clean up its act french president nicolas sarkozy 's visit to berlin aims to find common ground between germany and france ahead of the g-20 summit in pittsburgh , where paris will push for global rules limiting rewards for traders . nicolas sarkozy intends to lobby other world leaders in a bid to rein in large bonus payments in the banking world .
french banks have said they will put their own houses in order , following a meeting with the president last week .
it was the seventh time in a year that banking executives had been summoned to the elysee .
they listened as mr sarkozy targeted his anger at huge bonuses still being paid to traders .
he said he was outraged that the lessons of the crisis had not been learned .
penalties as well as bonuses paris has to be above reproach , the president said as he announced new control measures for french banks that went further than expected .
in future bonus payments will be partly delayed to take account of long-term performance .
payments will be closely monitored and enforced , and traders who lose money will be made to pay penalties .
france would not do business with banks that did not comply .
the president wants the issue to figure high on the agenda at pittsburgh in september .
" i want the g-20 to examine several proposals , " he said .
" a limit on total bonus payments to a proportion of revenues devoted to investment - that 's the first .
the second proposal is a cap on the largest bonuses .
and the third is to create in all financial centers , a tax on bonus payments that would fund deposit guarantees . "
french banks had already agreed to tougher regulation than elsewhere .
a new code of conduct drawn up earlier this year limits guaranteed bonuses and aims to discourage short term risk taking .
humble pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnp paribas ceo , baudoin prot , has promised to cut back bonus payments for traders the catalyst for the elysee meeting and still tougher rules was the revelation that bnp paribas , france 's largest bank , had set aside a billion euros for staff bonus payments .
the news was like a red rag to a bull for the french president .
outside the elysee , the head of bnp paribas , baudouin prot , was forced to eat humble pie .
he promised that his bank 's bonus pot would be cut by half this year .
and he vowed that french banks generally would accept the new rules and set an ethical example from now on .
but there is some concern that the measures will not work unless they are applied worldwide .
the head of another french high street bank has highlighted the problem of guaranteed bonuses .
" there are certain foreign banks , especially in london , that do n't operate in the same way , " said georges pauget of credit agricole .
" that bothers us .
if that handicap is removed in pittsburgh , i think we will be able to function unharmed in the new system .
if it is not removed , we 'll have to see what else comes out . "
traders go where the money takes them there have been warnings that if france alone applies tighter rules , traders will simply go elsewhere .
some have even evoked a doomsday scenario that paris might become a financial desert . " it is extremely difficult to regulate variable payments , without being prepared to take the very real risk of relocation to london , " said marc lamy , a former banker turned financial headhunter with boyden france .
" we can however seek to introduce more rationality and transparency in the processes by which payments are calculated and awarded . "
are the banks doing their job ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mezziouane says small businesses need more support from the nation 's banks arguably more important to the economy than the issue of bonuses is the need for banks to keep lending to businesses and households .
france has channelled billions of euros of state aid to banks to ensure they continue doing so .
yet recently there have been accusations that promises have not been respected .
" we 've noticed a grave problem of communication and relations between banks and businesses , " said abdellah mezziouane of the cgpme , the confederation of small and medium sized businesses in paris .
" the banks are n't transparent over how they make decisions on lending " .
part of his job is to harangue banks into funding enterprises he says deserve and need credit .
the cgpme claims that two-thirds of businesses need funding - and 78 percent are finding loans harder , not easier , to come by .
" entrepreneurs receive standard letters saying that credit they 've been getting for years is suddenly being stopped , " added mr mezziouane .

dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .
unfortunately , it was the first time the neo-nazi party was able to re-enter the state parliament , signalling that the danger of having a disastrous " brown " faction in germany 's parliament is not out of the question .

but offenders will be given a one-off chance to come clean with the taxman . french budget minister eric woerth revealed in a weekend interview that paris had obtained the names of 3,000 french taxpayers holding assets worth about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in three swiss banks . woerth told the journal du dimanche newspaper that at least some of names listed " very probably " belonged to tax evaders .
he said they would be given until dec .
31 to pay any overdue taxes or would face a full tax audit . " we are not bluffing .
we have a list of 3,000 names , " woerth told france 's radio classique on monday , although he said the government would not publicly name the banks nor the individuals concerned . left-wing opposition leaders in france have accused president nicolas sarkozy 's right-wing government of planning a mass amnesty for tax evaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader martine aubry says the tax evaders should be prosecuted immediately " the government says , ' we have names ' well , those people should be chased down , taxed , made to pay a penalty and taken to court , " socialist leader martine aubry told france info radio . " why give them until the end of the year to quietly settle up ? " she asked .
" when ordinary french people fail to pay their gas bill , they face a penalty .
the rules should apply to all . " but woerth denied that offenders would be let off the hook . " of course there is no amnesty , " he said .
" when i call on people to square their situation with the authorities , that means they will pay tax .
an amnesty is to pay no taxes , or very low taxes , which is not the case . " swiss silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some swiss officials said they did n't know about tax data sent the to the french woerth said most of the names on the list were obtained from the swiss tax authorities , while others were sourced directly from the banking establishments concerned . swiss authorities , however , said they were unaware of any bank data being transferred to france . swiss president hans-rudolf merz declined to answer reporters ' questions when exiting a climate change conference in geneva .
a spokesman for the finance ministry in bern was unavailable for comment . " we did not have any request from france about this matter , " an official at the swiss federal department of finance told german news agency dpa . new deals banking secrecy laws traditionally prohibit swiss banks from revealing information about their clients , except as part of a criminal investigation with the approval of authorities . while tax fraud is regarded as a crime in switzerland , tax evasion is generally treated only as a minor offence . but under a deal signed last week , switzerland agreed to offer france assistance on all tax offenses , in line with rules laid down by the organization for economic cooperation and development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president hans-rudolf merz says bern is not in the business of protecting criminals bern has negotiated similar agreements with a dozen nations , including japan , britain and the united states , in an effort to have itself removed from an oecd " grey list " of so-called tax havens .
while treaties with france , denmark and luxembourg have been finalized , most of the others are still awaiting ratification . switzerland 's largest bank , ubs has already handed over 250 names to us authorities and recently agreed to transfer data on at least 4,500 more accounts within a year as part of an out-of-court settlement .

but offenders will be given a one-off chance to come clean with the taxman . french budget minister eric woerth revealed in a weekend interview that paris had obtained the names of 3,000 french taxpayers holding assets worth about 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in three swiss banks . woerth told the journal du dimanche newspaper that at least some of names listed " very probably " belonged to tax evaders .
he said they would be given until dec .
31 to pay any overdue taxes or would face a full tax audit . " we are not bluffing .
we have a list of 3,000 names , " woerth told france 's radio classique on monday , although he said the government would not publicly name the banks nor the individuals concerned . left-wing opposition leaders in france have accused president nicolas sarkozy 's right-wing government of planning a mass amnesty for tax evaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader martine aubry says the tax evaders should be prosecuted immediately " the government says , ' we have names ' well , those people should be chased down , taxed , made to pay a penalty and taken to court , " socialist leader martine aubry told france info radio . " why give them until the end of the year to quietly settle up ? " she asked .
" when ordinary french people fail to pay their gas bill , they face a penalty .
the rules should apply to all . " but woerth denied that offenders would be let off the hook . " of course there is no amnesty , " he said .
" when i call on people to square their situation with the authorities , that means they will pay tax .
an amnesty is to pay no taxes , or very low taxes , which is not the case . " swiss silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some swiss officials said they did n't know about tax data sent the to the french woerth said most of the names on the list were obtained from the swiss tax authorities , while others were sourced directly from the banking establishments concerned . swiss authorities , however , said they were unaware of any bank data being transferred to france . swiss president hans-rudolf merz declined to answer reporters ' questions when exiting a climate change conference in geneva .
a spokesman for the finance ministry in bern was unavailable for comment .

dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .
unfortunately , it was the first time the neo-nazi party was able to re-enter the state parliament , signalling that the danger of having a disastrous " brown " faction in germany 's parliament is not out of the question .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 31.08.2009 opinion : merkel 's chances are still good , despite lost ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state ballots in saarland , saxony and thuringia show the christian democrats losing ground , the spd still weak and smaller parties gaining votes .
dw 's jochen vock explains what this could mean in the general election . election nights are rarely a time when german politicians speak their minds , and sunday 's state parliamentary elections were no exception .
everyone wanted to be called a winner - especially with key national parliamentary elections just four weeks away .
one thing is clear : the christian democratic union did n't benefit from a " chancellor bonus " in the local vote .
angela merkel may well enjoy widespread popularity , but her party took quite a few dramatic losses .
merkel 's goal of creating a coalition with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- after the september 27 elections remains realistic , thanks to strong gains on the part of the fdp . she ca n't feel entirely secure , but the tune that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have been singing - that germany does n't want a cdu -fdp coalition - is still just campaign chatter .
hollow rejoicing for spd for its part , the spd 's election-night rejoicing over " good returns " remains hollow .
at best , their results show them stabilized at their lowest level .
the spd still has future prospects for entering a coalition in two additional state governments , saarland and thuringia .
but on a federal level , that would only work out if it joined a three-way coalition with the left party and the greens .
the spd would n't carry enough create a partnership only with the greens on the federal level - and they currently refuse to join a coalition with the left party in federal politics .
this leaves a de-facto possibility of cdu-fdp , or the continuation of the " grand coalition " of cdu and spd .
bildunterschrift : vock : the ' merkel bonus ' failed to materialize the national trend toward five-party parliaments has continued , making new coalition combinations possible .
this includes the much-debated coalition of spd and left party - a combination that the cdu and fdp have long warned against .
surprisingly , no single election was particularly exciting ; many germans found it all dull .
they see politicians as being too far removed from critical daily issues , putting too much energy into internecine coalition wrangling , and too little into key issues such as the effects of the economic crisis on jobs , state finances and the social system .
disaffected voters , lower turnout many people just threw up their hands and failed to show up at the voting booths .
but that does n't necessarily bode ill for the national elections .
lower turnout in state elections is commonplace , and what 's more , many voters are still undecided .
that makes it all the harder to predict the final outcome of the national election .
there is one good piece of news for democracy , however : the far-right npd saw a significant drop in votes in the state of saxony .

" " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university , said .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " alliance with the left not easy for spd but the spd still faces a tough task of turning around its dismal ratings .
merkel 's party still leads by a large margin in opinion polls . the left party , descendants of the former ruling party of communist east germany , and the fdp , were sunday 's biggest winners . but any state cooperation between the spd , the green party and the left party - descendants of the ruling party of former communist east germany - could be targeted by the conservatives to warn of a " red wave . " given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party in western germany so far .
the social democrats have however repeatedly ruled out any federal coalition with the left party . outcome wide open but on monday , many german newspapers warned against reading too much into sunday 's election results . " interpreting this setback -lsb- for merkel -rsb- as a clear signal of a turnaround in the battle for berlin in four weeks is wide of the mark , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
business daily handelsblatt noted that " trying to predict the outcome of the federal election from sunday 's results is about as reliable as reading tea leaves .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .

but the cdu still remains the largest party in both states .
" the vote losses in thuringia and saarland are painful , " cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said sunday after the polls closed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland premier peter mueller will likely lose his job after his cdu party lost heavily the losses at the state level could be a blow for chancellor angela merkel , who 's campaigning for a second term in federal elections to be held september 27 .
merkel 's party looks likely to only hold onto the former east german state of saxony , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich . " the saxons have voted wisely , " tillich said sunday evening .
" i accept this responsibility with gratitude but also with respect for the will of the voters . " red-red-green coalitions possible next door in thuringia , incumbent cdu premier dieter althaus could lose office after his party drew only about 31 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent five years ago . althaus saw his popularity dip after he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for crashing into and killing a 41-year-old woman on a ski slope in austria on new year 's day . he could form a coalition with the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , mirroring the current national government .
alternatively , a coalition between the spd , the far-left left party and the environmentalist green party is also possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voter turnout was higher compared to the last election in thuringia and the saarland in the western german state of saarland , the cdu had ruled alone after pulling in 47.5 percent of the vote in 2004 .
projections from sunday 's election say the party will receive just 35 percent of the vote , which could lead to an spd , left party , green coalition as in thuringia . if the left party enters a coalition in the saarland , it would be the first time the party , which is composed of former east german communists and disaffected former sdp members , joins a government in western germany . given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party .
in order to reassure potential voters ahead of next month 's national election , spd head franz muenterfering ruled out sunday night an alliance between the two parties on the national level . social democrats breathe a small sigh of relief sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the spd , which has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the saxon government , the party seems likely to gain power in saarland and thuringia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's steinmeier spoke of a " good election sunday " " i have heard many time in the last few weeks that the federal election is over .
this evening shows that that was wrong , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , said . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " said karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " merkel 's preferred coalition partner , the pro-market free democratic party also made gains sunday .
saxon premier tillich is likely to form a coalition with the free democrats after projections showed the party pulling in over 10 percent of the vote .
but a cdu-fdp coalition was blocked in the other two states holding polls sunday . " we 're the winners of this evening , " fdp chief guido westerwelle said on sunday evening .
he said the results , which may lead to left-leaning coalitions in thuringia and the saarland , should be considered " a warning shot for the entire republic . " the far-right extremist npd party failed to gain seats in the thuringia parliament .
the npd , which is under surveillance for its anti-immigrant message , managed to hold onto its seats in the saxon parliament , though its share fell to about 5 percent , down from over 9 percent five years ago . author : bn / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , the climate will continue to change , " gro harlem brundtland , the united nations secretary-general 's special envoy on climate change , said on monday .
" all countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate . " but the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms , rising sea levels , droughts , and famine , but how the information is used , according to wmo secretary-general michel jarraud . " the problem is that much information on the climate is not used properly , " jarraud told reporters .
" it 's time to link technology and science with decision makers . " climate justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan said rich countries should make the biggest emissions cuts the conference comes before world leaders and delegates are set to meet in copenhagen in december in an effort to agree on a binding deal that would curb global warming before the kyoto protocol , the current compromise on reducing greenhouse gases , runs out in 2012 . former un secretary-general kofi annan told delegates in geneva that climate agreements had to be " radical , universal and binding " and have " climate justice at its heart . " annan said the people most affected by climate change were the poorest and least developed nations that contributed the least to pollution . " the most advanced economies must take the lead by taking the most drastic -lrb- emissions -rrb- cuts , " the former un head said , while urging countries to share weather information and cooperate on climate issues . better data for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians need good data as the basis of their decisions , jarraud said climate change is already underway and will continue regardless of any compromises made at major climate negotiations , jarraud added . " even if copenhagen is successful on greenhouse gases , a certain warming -lrb- of the planet -rrb- will occur , " he said , adding that improved knowledge of the climate could help manage water and food needs , in addition to preserving the environment . jarraud gave the examples of malaria and cholera , two potentially fatal diseases that spread in certain climate conditions .
better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur . " we need to anticipate change , we can no longer base ourselves on the past to take decisions for the future , " he told journalists . the information can also help reduce costs and benefit sectors of the economy , such as tourism . " climate change is here now and countries need tools to adapt to the changing climate , " the wmo wrote in its invitation to the world climate conference . the meeting of representatives from some 80 nations is the third world climate conference .
the first took place in 1979 and the second in 1990 .
those meetings are credited with leading to the creation of the intergovernmental panel on climate change , which won the 2007 nobel peace prize . sms / dpa / afp editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these planned power outages due to a lack in capacity affect the whole country and are called " load shedding " .
industries have stopped working due to electricity shortages , leading to a loss in the production .
this again means that people are thrown out of jobs .
saheed farhaz , the owner of nafisa textiles in lahore says , " i am facing 5 to 8 hours of load shedding a day now .
i have to pay the labour charges and other input costs , so definitely the result will be a huge loss .
so power is a big issue here . "
not only for the industrial sector , also for common men and women .
without air condition or fans , the heat becomes unbearable .
a karachi resident complains , " as a common pakistani , i am suffering a lot because of this power shortage .
unfortunately , i am unable to go on with my daily routine and can not even reach office on time due to the long power breaks at night . "
capacity shortages pakistan failed to implement long-needed power projects during the economic boom between 2002 and 2007 .
although the government has now approved the 4,500 megawatt diamer-bhasa dam project and other hydropower projects to overcome the energy crisis , experts think a short term plan is in need .
professor abid a. burki from the lahore university of management sciences says : " for example we have sugar mills and other manufacturing units who have surplus electricity and you need to devise a mechanism how that electricity can be brought into the main system .
secondly , pakistan possesses the third largest coal reserves in the world and it is about time that the policy makers seriously consider the potential to generate electricity through coal .
and finally , the policy makers in pakistan must start popularising energy use efficiency simply by raising awareness . "
outsourcing power generation while the government has taken up a temporary plan of outsourcing power generation to private so-called rental power plants , burki thinks this solution is too expensive , as they tend to charge more for the electricity .
" this is a double edged sword " , says burki .
" because letting a shortfall in electricity persist would contribute to a slowdown in the growth rate of pakistan 's economy ; on the other hand , achieving self-sufficiency by involving these rental power plants might again lead to a slowdown in the growth rate because the cost of electricity would shoot up . "
experts believe it is high time that a stable policy is implemented to solve the problem .
otherwise , the widespread agitations and protests against the power crisis all over pakistan will destabilize the country further and hamper its focus on fighting militancy and terrorism .

these planned power outages due to a lack in capacity affect the whole country and are called " load shedding " .
industries have stopped working due to electricity shortages , leading to a loss in the production .
this again means that people are thrown out of jobs .
saheed farhaz , the owner of nafisa textiles in lahore says , " i am facing 5 to 8 hours of load shedding a day now .
i have to pay the labour charges and other input costs , so definitely the result will be a huge loss .
so power is a big issue here . "
not only for the industrial sector , also for common men and women .
without air condition or fans , the heat becomes unbearable .
a karachi resident complains , " as a common pakistani , i am suffering a lot because of this power shortage .
unfortunately , i am unable to go on with my daily routine and can not even reach office on time due to the long power breaks at night . "
capacity shortages pakistan failed to implement long-needed power projects during the economic boom between 2002 and 2007 .
although the government has now approved the 4,500 megawatt diamer-bhasa dam project and other hydropower projects to overcome the energy crisis , experts think a short term plan is in need .
professor abid a. burki from the lahore university of management sciences says : " for example we have sugar mills and other manufacturing units who have surplus electricity and you need to devise a mechanism how that electricity can be brought into the main system .
secondly , pakistan possesses the third largest coal reserves in the world and it is about time that the policy makers seriously consider the potential to generate electricity through coal .
and finally , the policy makers in pakistan must start popularising energy use efficiency simply by raising awareness . "
outsourcing power generation while the government has taken up a temporary plan of outsourcing power generation to private so-called rental power plants , burki thinks this solution is too expensive , as they tend to charge more for the electricity .
" this is a double edged sword " , says burki .
" because letting a shortfall in electricity persist would contribute to a slowdown in the growth rate of pakistan 's economy ; on the other hand , achieving self-sufficiency by involving these rental power plants might again lead to a slowdown in the growth rate because the cost of electricity would shoot up . "
experts believe it is high time that a stable policy is implemented to solve the problem .
otherwise , the widespread agitations and protests against the power crisis all over pakistan will destabilize the country further and hamper its focus on fighting militancy and terrorism .

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .

merkel insisted that voters saw her conservatives and the fdp as best-placed to lead germany out of a steep economic downturn . " we all agree that in light of the crisis , the issues are economic growth and jobs , " she said .
" yesterday made clear what germany needs : clear-cut and stable alliances , " she said . the chancellor also ruled out changing her own personal campaigning style and adopting a more forceful stance . " i wo n't think in terms of camps but rather try to win over people .
that 's why i 'm not going to become more aggressive , i 'll focus on making better arguments . " " a wake-up call for conservatives " on sunday , merkel 's conservatives suffered a double blow when support slumped by more than 10 points for the cdu in the state of saarland , on the french border , and thuringia , in the former communist east . although the cdu remains the largest party in both states , its leaders could be unseated by leftist coalitions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon premier stanislav tillich was the undisputed cdu victor of the evening in the eastern german state of saxony , however , the outcome was markedly different .
merkel 's party , led by the state 's popular cdu premier , stanislav tillich , retained power , winning handily with more than 40 percent of the vote . but the stinging defeats in saarland and thuringia have unnerved the conservatives .
senior members of merkel 's party voiced concerns about widespread fallout from the results , fearing a huge decline in support four weeks ahead of the national election . " this is a wake-up call for everyone in the conservatives who had believed that an election victory on sept .
27 was a given , " wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' parliamentary group , told public broadcaster br . " we must translate the high popularity ratings of the chancellor into votes , " christian wulff , the cdu premier of lower saxony said . social democrats take heart sunday 's results were a faint ray of hope for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , with whom merkel has shared power since 2005 .
the party has struggled to capture the imagination of voters and has reached historic lows in opinion polls .
despite losing its role in the government of saxony as the junior partner , the party could become the kingmakers in saarland and thuringia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier now has some success to build on " two things are clear : there have been dramatic losses for the conservatives and there is no desire for a conservative-fdp coalition , " frank-walter steinmeier , german foreign minister and the spd 's candidate for chancellor , told the hannoversche allgemeine daily . " the social democrats now have the aura of a winner , something they will need for the coming weeks , " karl-rudolf korte , a political scientist at duisburg-essen university , said .
" it could mean a turning point in the election campaign . " alliance with the left not easy for spd but the spd still faces a tough task of turning around its dismal ratings .
merkel 's party still leads by a large margin in opinion polls . the left party , descendants of the former ruling party of communist east germany , and the fdp , were sunday 's biggest winners . but any state cooperation between the spd , the green party and the left party - descendants of the ruling party of former communist east germany - could be targeted by the conservatives to warn of a " red wave . " given the left party 's ties to the former east german communist party , the spd has been loath to enter coalitions with the party in western germany so far .
the social democrats have however repeatedly ruled out any federal coalition with the left party . outcome wide open but on monday , many german newspapers warned against reading too much into sunday 's election results . " interpreting this setback -lsb- for merkel -rsb- as a clear signal of a turnaround in the battle for berlin in four weeks is wide of the mark , " the financial times deutschland wrote .
business daily handelsblatt noted that " trying to predict the outcome of the federal election from sunday 's results is about as reliable as reading tea leaves .

" even if we reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , the climate will continue to change , " gro harlem brundtland , the united nations secretary-general 's special envoy on climate change , said on monday .
" all countries will need to adapt to a changing and more erratic climate . " but the problem is not a lack of dire warnings about more storms , rising sea levels , droughts , and famine , but how the information is used , according to wmo secretary-general michel jarraud . " the problem is that much information on the climate is not used properly , " jarraud told reporters .
" it 's time to link technology and science with decision makers . " climate justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annan said rich countries should make the biggest emissions cuts the conference comes before world leaders and delegates are set to meet in copenhagen in december in an effort to agree on a binding deal that would curb global warming before the kyoto protocol , the current compromise on reducing greenhouse gases , runs out in 2012 . former un secretary-general kofi annan told delegates in geneva that climate agreements had to be " radical , universal and binding " and have " climate justice at its heart . " annan said the people most affected by climate change were the poorest and least developed nations that contributed the least to pollution . " the most advanced economies must take the lead by taking the most drastic -lrb- emissions -rrb- cuts , " the former un head said , while urging countries to share weather information and cooperate on climate issues . better data for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians need good data as the basis of their decisions , jarraud said climate change is already underway and will continue regardless of any compromises made at major climate negotiations , jarraud added . " even if copenhagen is successful on greenhouse gases , a certain warming -lrb- of the planet -rrb- will occur , " he said , adding that improved knowledge of the climate could help manage water and food needs , in addition to preserving the environment . jarraud gave the examples of malaria and cholera , two potentially fatal diseases that spread in certain climate conditions .
better weather data can help health authorities know when and where an outbreak might occur . " we need to anticipate change , we can no longer base ourselves on the past to take decisions for the future , " he told journalists . the information can also help reduce costs and benefit sectors of the economy , such as tourism . " climate change is here now and countries need tools to adapt to the changing climate , " the wmo wrote in its invitation to the world climate conference . the meeting of representatives from some 80 nations is the third world climate conference .
the first took place in 1979 and the second in 1990 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 31.08.2009 latest afghan vote count shows karzai still in lead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai remains on track to win the most votes abdullah has closed the game , but the incumbent remains on track to win afghan 's second direct presidential election .
but allegations of voter fraud continue to be a source of concern . current afghan president hamid karzai retained a slim lead over main opponent abdullah abdullah in election results updated on monday .
the votes from 47.8 percent of afghanistan 's polling stations have so far been counted , but there is broad concern about what seems to have been an extremely low turnout and allegations of fraud . karzai has 45.9 percent of the votes counted so far , while his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , has 33.2 percent .
the latest results narrowed the previous gap between them to 12.6 percent , from 14.8 percent .
to avoid a runoff , karzai will need to get 50 percent of the total votes counted , plus one .
most of the ballots counted so far have come from the country 's north , where abdullah is the more popular candidate .
but observers say yet-uncounted votes from provinces in the south - where karzai 's ethnic group , the pashtuns , predominate - could put him over the top .
afghanistan 's electoral complaints commission told afp that it is trying to investigate nearly 700 allegations categorized as " priority a , " meaning that they could potentially affect the final election outcome and must be investigated before officials certify the final results .
the commission has logged 2,097 complaints since election day on august 20 .
the results have also point to a turnout of just 30 to 35 percent , adding to fears about the election 's legitimacy .
abdullah has accused karzai of tampering with the election and said he would look into legal ways to counteract what he has called " state engineered fraud . "
final results probably wo n't be known before mid-september .
independent election commission spokesman noor mohammad noor said preliminary results would be released between september 3 and september 7 , with the final tally becoming available september 17 .

he is aiming for the state premiership of his native saarland in elections on aug .
30 . oskar lafontaine has often been accused of using provocation to draw attention to the left party .
in an interview with news magazine der spiegel in may he again offered social democrat leader frank-walter steinmeier an impossible coalition : " he could be chancellor tomorrow if he were to push through the minimum wage , restore the previous pension system , abolish -lsb- the unemployment benefit reforms introduced in 2005 -rsb- and pull the german military out of afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudolf scharping -lrb- left -rrb- was beaten to the spd leadership by his deputy lafontaine at the 1995 party conference .
since its inception in 2005 , lafontaine 's tactic has been to attract voters disgruntled with centrist politics with bullish sound bites like this .
his success with oppositional anti-war , anti-capitalist and occasionally anti-immigrant policies have dealt blows to the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , of which he was once chairman and chancellor candidate , by tempting away much of its traditional working class base . but his belligerence has not spared the right either .
he has openly denounced george bush and tony blair as terrorists , and in political magazine cicero he said of the christian democratic union , germany ’ s main center-right party : " they made former nazis into chancellors and presidents . " a party with attitude by driving the left party into a state of permanent opposition on a national level , he has won considerable grassroots support , creating an alliance of disenchanted spd voters in the west and former communist voters in the east .
while lafontaine 's uncompromising stance effectively precludes the left party 's assimilation in a coalition to rule germany , the party has managed to gain a foothold in regional state governments in the former east . a new opportunity for lafontaine and his party arose this year , when the christian democrats ' hold on the state premiership in lafontaine 's home state of saarland began to weaken .
lafontaine is a very popular figure in a state he led as spd premier from 1985 to 1998 , and he still identifies strongly with its majority community of working class roman catholics . in state elections held on aug .
30 , the party made dramatic gains in the western german state of saarland , where it cracked the 20 percent barrier after drawing only 2.3 percent of the vote in 2004 .
if the left party could take its first premiership in a western state , it would mark a significant success ahead of national elections on sept .
27 .
on top of this , a new " red-red " coalition with the spd in saarland would further damage steinmeier 's slim chances of becoming chancellor .
once again , lafontaine would have orchestrated a poisonous attack on his old party . spd 's hot-shot in the 1990s the 65-year-old lafontaine has been a contentious figure throughout his political career .
he gained national prominence in 1990 , when he was the spd 's chancellor candidate against helmut kohl .
despite losing this election heavily , after fatally expressing reservations about german reunification in the face of public euphoria , lafontaine made a spectacular comeback in 1995 when he became chairman of the spd by dramatically defeating the incumbent , rudolf scharping , the losing chancellor candidate of 1994 .
his emotional speech seduced a party conference audience keen to reverse falling poll ratings and long years of defeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine currently heads the left party 's leading trio , which includes lothar bisky -lrb- center -rrb- and gregor gysi -lrb- right -rrb- despite fears that he would drag the spd fatally to the left , lafontaine masterminded the party 's strategy of politically isolating kohl in the final , exhausted legislature of his marathon reign .
his reward came in 1998 , when he was appointed finance minister in gerhard schroeder 's first cabinet .
this proved to be the zenith of his career . the rebel rises his apostasy began when he resigned the ministry , along with his spd chairmanship , in march 1999 , after only 186 days in the cabinet .
in his short tenure , lafontaine had acquired the reputation of a party traditionalist , standing for the spd 's old allegiance to the working class , and blocking schroeder 's attempts at reforming germany 's tax and social security system . in the years that followed , lafontaine found himself increasingly alienated within the spd , particularly after publishing his book " das herz schlaegt links " -lrb- " the heart beats on the left " -rrb- in october 1999 .
the book criticized the lack of team spirit in schroeder 's government and lamented the broken promises of the 1998 election campaign . a new party emerges after many damaging statements that cost the spd support in its working-class base , lafontaine left the spd , after nearly 40 years membership , in may 2005 ahead of the general election .
two weeks of dramatic media speculation followed , until lafontaine emerged as the leading chancellor candidate in a new coalition of leftists that bound together the electoral alternative for labor and social justice alliance -lrb- wasg -rrb- and the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to east germany 's ruling party , the sed . his public role as a persistent irritant to the spd has won him votes , but it has also drawn criticism , marked as it is with the bitterness of personal disappointment .
the spd has never forgiven him for what is seen as his betrayal , and their rancor is only exacerbated by the satisfaction lafontaine seems to gain from their humiliation .
lafontaine is unrepentant : " unfortunately every leader of the spd has promoted war and the dismantling of the welfare state , " he told cicero . recent reports suggest that lafontaine may face a leadership contest in the left party after the election , as a growing number of party members from the former east seek to break the hold that his dominant personality has on the party .

they plan to try to get the rest of the eu on board before september 's g-20 meeting . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy agreed to take a common approach regarding bankers ' bonus payments , following a meeting in berlin on monday . unbridled risk-taking by some bankers has often been cited as one of the main factors that led to the global financial crisis , and the incentive of lucrative bonus payments has often been blamed for stoking bankers ' willingness to take chances . " the international community needs to understand that the excesses of speculation and financial -lrb- institutions -rrb- which led to the crisis can not resume as though nothing had happened , " sarkozy said in berlin . merkel reiterated demands for international regulations that would keep the size of global banks in check . " no bank can be allowed to become so big that it is in a position to blackmail governments , " she said . merkel and sarkozy have also called on the european union to adopt a common stance before the two-day g-20 meeting , which is to be held in the us city of pittsburgh beginning on september 24 . global regulations a tough sell despite berlin and paris both coming out in clear support of international bank regulations as a way of preventing any future global financial crisis from happening , getting the rest of the g-20 nations to accept these terms is another story .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance expert wolfgang gerke says it is critical for banking regulations to be applied worldwide " you need the acceptance of all of the g-20 countries , especially the united states and great britain , " wolfgang gerke , president of the bavarian center of finance , told deutsche welle .
" they feel that their financial centers would suffer if there is too much regulation .
and therefore they are for continuing the system they had for many years . " he noted that in the absence of international standards countries that do have tough bonus regulations would be at a disadvantage compared to countries with looser regulations . " -lsb- german investment bankers -rsb- would tell the government : if they are too strict , they will quit the country and go to other places , like london , " gerke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g20 summit is scheduled for september 24-25 in pittsburgh .

the minimum wage is in its tenth year for all the controversy when it was first introduced , amidst predictions that it would lead to an additional two million unemployed , it is now almost impossible to find any senior political figure who wants its repeal .
the minimum wage quickly became broadly accepted across the political spectrum in the uk , by all the mainstream parties , the unions and most business organisations .
yet it took years of campaigning before the minimum wage became law , and the initial opposition came not from the political right or from business , where you might expect , but from the left .
in the 1970s and early-1980s , most british trade unions were adamantly opposed to the concept of a minimum wage .
no consensus they feared that it would undermine the cherished principle of free collective bargaining and that it would pull down pay rates above it , reducing so-called " differentials " , the gap between the skilled and unskilled workers .
and there was self-interest at work too .
if a minimum wage protected people 's wages , then what was the incentive to join a union ?
one exception was the public services union nupe , which represented many of the lowest-paid workers .
but it took them decades of arguing and lobbying before they managed to win over the rest of the union movement , and get the policy adopted at both tuc and labour party conferences .
the initial figure , an hourly rate of £ 3.60 for adult workers , and just £ 3.00 for 18-21 year olds , was considered too low by the unions even into the 1990s , there was no consensus about the minimum wage on the left .
can you guess which current cabinet minister wrote this ?
" the allure of a minimum wage is deceptive and should be resisted ...
fostering a high wage , high skill economy is the only way to reverse britain 's relative economic decline and to generate the resources to eradicate poverty .
but the minimum wage is not the answer .
if anything the minimum wage will make it even harder to achieve these ends . "
the answer : ed balls , writing in 1991 .
nupe 's initial goal was for a set rate : a minimum wage of two thirds of average earnings .
and the union reached agreement with the then shadow chancellor john smith , in 1991 , at a meeting at magdalen college , oxford - the minimum wage would be set to 50 % of male median earnings initially , rising to two-thirds over time .
prudent approach things did n't work out like that , though .
smith died in 1994 , and his replacement , tony blair was having none of it .
the set rate went out of the window and in came a low pay commission , which would establish a rate each year after negotiation and research .
the initial figure , an hourly rate of £ 3.60 for adult workers , and just £ 3.00 for 18-21 year olds , was considered too low by the unions .
yet the level was crucial .
as george bain , the first chair of the low pay commission , said at the time any idiot can set a minimum wage .
what matters is getting the level right : high enough to protect the low-paid , not too high to damage the economy .
and initially , the commission erred on the side of prudence .
the cbi 's john cridland , another member of the commission , says that its activities were a little like the ranging shots contestants used to take in 1960s tv show the golden shot .
the first one might have been too low , and the level soon crept up faster than prices or earnings .
but the flexibility of the approach , and the initial low level , helped calm business concerns and won over the cbi and other employer organisations in a way that a fixed rate might not have done .
of course , the minimum wage is not universally accepted , especially with the uk in recession .
the conservative mp christopher chope recently introduced a private member 's bill which would have allowed people to opt out of the minimum wage .
but despite their vehement opposition before the 1997 election the conservatives accepted the minimum wage within a year of its introduction and the party leadership has made it clear that it has no plans to repeal it .
and for all union opposition initially , you now can not find a union that would repeal the minimum wage .
professor philip cowley presents the first in a three part series , where did it all go right ? , on 31 august at 2000 bst on radio 4 .

the initial figure , an hourly rate of £ 3.60 for adult workers , and just £ 3.00 for 18-21 year olds , was considered too low by the unions even into the 1990s , there was no consensus about the minimum wage on the left .

" the allure of a minimum wage is deceptive and should be resisted ...
fostering a high wage , high skill economy is the only way to reverse britain 's relative economic decline and to generate the resources to eradicate poverty .
but the minimum wage is not the answer .
if anything the minimum wage will make it even harder to achieve these ends . "
the answer : ed balls , writing in 1991 .
nupe 's initial goal was for a set rate : a minimum wage of two thirds of average earnings .
and the union reached agreement with the then shadow chancellor john smith , in 1991 , at a meeting at magdalen college , oxford - the minimum wage would be set to 50 % of male median earnings initially , rising to two-thirds over time .
prudent approach things did n't work out like that , though .
smith died in 1994 , and his replacement , tony blair was having none of it .
the set rate went out of the window and in came a low pay commission , which would establish a rate each year after negotiation and research .
the initial figure , an hourly rate of £ 3.60 for adult workers , and just £ 3.00 for 18-21 year olds , was considered too low by the unions .
yet the level was crucial .
as george bain , the first chair of the low pay commission , said at the time any idiot can set a minimum wage .
what matters is getting the level right : high enough to protect the low-paid , not too high to damage the economy .
and initially , the commission erred on the side of prudence .
the cbi 's john cridland , another member of the commission , says that its activities were a little like the ranging shots contestants used to take in 1960s tv show the golden shot .
the first one might have been too low , and the level soon crept up faster than prices or earnings .
but the flexibility of the approach , and the initial low level , helped calm business concerns and won over the cbi and other employer organisations in a way that a fixed rate might not have done .
of course , the minimum wage is not universally accepted , especially with the uk in recession .
the conservative mp christopher chope recently introduced a private member 's bill which would have allowed people to opt out of the minimum wage .
but despite their vehement opposition before the 1997 election the conservatives accepted the minimum wage within a year of its introduction and the party leadership has made it clear that it has no plans to repeal it .
and for all union opposition initially , you now can not find a union that would repeal the minimum wage .

" we do n't have contact ... and we had to terminate ... , " said the head of isro - the indian space research organisation .
the unmanned craft was launched last october in what was billed as a two-year mission of exploration .
the launch was seen as a major step for india as it seeks to keep pace with other space-faring asian nations .
despite the termination of the mission , isro chief g madhavan nair told reporters that the project was a great success and 95 % of its objectives had been completed .
" we could collect a large volume of data , including 70,000 images of the moon , " he added .
isro scientists said the agency was in talks with the us and russia to track the spacecraft , which was orbiting 200km from the surface of the moon .
following its launch from the southern state of andhra pradesh last october , it was hoped the robotic probe would orbit the moon , compile a three-dimensional atlas of the lunar surface and map the distribution of elements and minerals .
useful mission ?
last month the satellite experienced a technical problem when a sensor malfunctioned .
an isro spokesman said at the time that useful information had already been gathered from pictures beamed to earth from the probe , although the picture quality had been affected by the malfunction .
powered by a single solar panel generating about 700 watts , the isro probe carries five indian-built instruments and six constructed in other countries , including the us , britain and germany .
the mission was expected to cost 3.8bn rupees -lrb- £ 45m ; $ 78m -rrb- , considerably less than japanese and chinese probes sent to the moon last year .
but the indian government 's space efforts have not been welcomed by all .
some critics regard the space programme as a waste of resources in a country where millions still lack basic services .

" we do n't have contact ... and we had to terminate ... , " said the head of isro - the indian space research organisation .
the unmanned craft was launched last october in what was billed as a two-year mission of exploration .
the launch was seen as a major step for india as it seeks to keep pace with other space-faring asian nations .
despite the termination of the mission , isro chief g madhavan nair told reporters that the project was a great success and 95 % of its objectives had been completed .
" we could collect a large volume of data , including 70,000 images of the moon , " he added .
isro scientists said the agency was in talks with the us and russia to track the spacecraft , which was orbiting 200km from the surface of the moon .
following its launch from the southern state of andhra pradesh last october , it was hoped the robotic probe would orbit the moon , compile a three-dimensional atlas of the lunar surface and map the distribution of elements and minerals .
useful mission ?
last month the satellite experienced a technical problem when a sensor malfunctioned .
an isro spokesman said at the time that useful information had already been gathered from pictures beamed to earth from the probe , although the picture quality had been affected by the malfunction .
powered by a single solar panel generating about 700 watts , the isro probe carries five indian-built instruments and six constructed in other countries , including the us , britain and germany .
the mission was expected to cost 3.8bn rupees -lrb- £ 45m ; $ 78m -rrb- , considerably less than japanese and chinese probes sent to the moon last year .
but the indian government 's space efforts have not been welcomed by all .
some critics regard the space programme as a waste of resources in a country where millions still lack basic services .
