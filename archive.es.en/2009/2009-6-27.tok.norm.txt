the local catholic bishop of regensburg earlier accused the group of defying his authority .
father stefan frey , the head of the seminary , told 1,500 guests who had gathered for the ceremony , that they were being criticized by the german catholic church .
" we deplore the verbal bullying we have been receiving in recent days from several german bishops , " frey said .
but he conceded that the group was still operating in what he called a " grey area " under church law .
swedish , polish and swiss seminarians aged 26 to 30 were declared priests in the saturday ceremony .
the schismatic society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican says the sspx has no status in the church the society of pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- consists of catholics who do not agree with the modern developments in the church that were introduced by the second vatican council , including detente with judaism and a conversion of worship from latin to vernacular languages .
ahead of the ordination , the vatican said that the ordinations would not be permissible under church law .
frey , however , said the vatican had not demanded that the society stop administering catholic sacraments .
the pope has urged the sspx to rejoin the church , but has been assailed by other catholics for allowing the traditionalists to use old , anti-jewish prayers .
the group ordained 13 new priests in winona , minnesota last weekend .
international scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson cast doubt on the number of jews who died in the holocaust the sspx was the subject of controversy last year when one of their bishops , richard williamson , said in an interview that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles , especially after it became known that pope benedict xvi had lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other sspx bishops in an attempt to bring the sect closer to rome .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust at the time , even though critics pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter had existed for some time. av / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 27.06.2009 african elites ignore poverty exacerbating the continent 's problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeletsi mbeki , the former south african president 's brother , says africa 's elites are damaging the country in his latest book moeletsi mbeki blames african elites for not doing enough against poverty on the continent .
the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .

the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .

the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

the local catholic bishop of regensburg earlier accused the group of defying his authority .
father stefan frey , the head of the seminary , told 1,500 guests who had gathered for the ceremony , that they were being criticized by the german catholic church .
" we deplore the verbal bullying we have been receiving in recent days from several german bishops , " frey said .
but he conceded that the group was still operating in what he called a " grey area " under church law .
swedish , polish and swiss seminarians aged 26 to 30 were declared priests in the saturday ceremony .
the schismatic society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican says the sspx has no status in the church the society of pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- consists of catholics who do not agree with the modern developments in the church that were introduced by the second vatican council , including detente with judaism and a conversion of worship from latin to vernacular languages .
ahead of the ordination , the vatican said that the ordinations would not be permissible under church law .
frey , however , said the vatican had not demanded that the society stop administering catholic sacraments .
the pope has urged the sspx to rejoin the church , but has been assailed by other catholics for allowing the traditionalists to use old , anti-jewish prayers .
the group ordained 13 new priests in winona , minnesota last weekend .
international scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson cast doubt on the number of jews who died in the holocaust the sspx was the subject of controversy last year when one of their bishops , richard williamson , said in an interview that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles , especially after it became known that pope benedict xvi had lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other sspx bishops in an attempt to bring the sect closer to rome .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust at the time , even though critics pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter had existed for some time. av / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are concerned about the aftermath of the iranian presidential election , " the ministers from the world 's richest group of nations said in a statement .
" we fully respect the sovereignty of iran .
at the same time we deplore post-election violence which led to the loss of lives of iranian civilians and urge iran to respect fundamental human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in trieste layed the groundwork for the g8 summit next month the g8 statement further urged the iranian government to " guarantee that the will of the iranian people is reflected in the electoral process . "
the statement did not cast doubt on the election or call for a re-count .
tehran responded to the statement saying it was interfering and hasty .
the french foreign minister bernar kouchner admitted that the final declaration was a compromise between the more conciliatory russian position and the tougher european union stand .
" it 's obvious that we were not in agreement on the situation in iran , " kouchner said .
" we are united on the nuclear issue and that 's positive . "
the g8 ministers criticized north korea 's nuclear and missile tests and urged the reclusive nation to return to the negotiating table .
afghan elections and drug policy the ministers stressed that the presidential elections in afgahnistan scheduled for august should be fair , credible and peaceful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug eradication efforts in afghanistan have not produced results " the group emphasized the importance of credible , inclusive and secure elections that reflect the will of the afghan people , " said a statement from the group of 20 countries and organizations known as the afghanistan-pakistan international support group .
another topic of discussion at the meetings in trieste was the afghan drug eradication issue .
the us envoy to the region richard holbrooke said that the previous eradication efforts had been largely unsuccessful .
" the western policies against the opium crop , the poppy crop , have been a failure , " holbrooke told reuters .
" they did not result in any damage to the taliban , but they put farmers out of work . "
" we are not going to support crop eradication .
we 're going to phase it out , " he said adding that the emphasis from now on would be on intercepting the drugs and the chemicals needed to make them and going after drug lords .
the peace process the meetings in trieste were originally set to focus on afghanistan , pakistan and the middle east peace process , but the crisis in iran topped the agenda .
in a statement concerning the peace process , the ministers called on israel to halt building jewish settlements in palestinian territories , saying that it is one of the key elements in reviving the efforts toward peace in the area .
the talks in trieste are laying the groundwork for the g8 summit that will take place in the town of l 'aquila from july 8-10. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are concerned about the aftermath of the iranian presidential election , " the ministers from the world 's richest group of nations said in a statement .
" we fully respect the sovereignty of iran .
at the same time we deplore post-election violence which led to the loss of lives of iranian civilians and urge iran to respect fundamental human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in trieste layed the groundwork for the g8 summit next month the g8 statement further urged the iranian government to " guarantee that the will of the iranian people is reflected in the electoral process . "
the statement did not cast doubt on the election or call for a re-count .
tehran responded to the statement saying it was interfering and hasty .
the french foreign minister bernar kouchner admitted that the final declaration was a compromise between the more conciliatory russian position and the tougher european union stand .
" it 's obvious that we were not in agreement on the situation in iran , " kouchner said .
" we are united on the nuclear issue and that 's positive . "
the g8 ministers criticized north korea 's nuclear and missile tests and urged the reclusive nation to return to the negotiating table .
afghan elections and drug policy the ministers stressed that the presidential elections in afgahnistan scheduled for august should be fair , credible and peaceful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug eradication efforts in afghanistan have not produced results " the group emphasized the importance of credible , inclusive and secure elections that reflect the will of the afghan people , " said a statement from the group of 20 countries and organizations known as the afghanistan-pakistan international support group .
another topic of discussion at the meetings in trieste was the afghan drug eradication issue .
the us envoy to the region richard holbrooke said that the previous eradication efforts had been largely unsuccessful .
" the western policies against the opium crop , the poppy crop , have been a failure , " holbrooke told reuters .
" they did not result in any damage to the taliban , but they put farmers out of work . "

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .

both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .
and , when it was advertised by code in the newspaper - in the frankfurt allgemeine , i think - then the suspicion became firmer .
i found it rather disconcerting .
i do n't know the background .
here , it 's possible that the museum has been used as a means to an end . interview : sabine oelze -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : ian p. johnson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

initial concerns over foul play have been ruled out . the los angeles county coroner 's office said following an autopsy there were no signs of trauma in jackson 's death , but that additional tests will be needed to determine exactly how the singer died .
" the cause of death has been deferred , " said craig harvey of the coroner 's office .
" the medical examiner has ordered additional testing such as toxicology and other studies . "
harvey said the tests would take four to six weeks to complete .
the outpouring of grief continues following jackson 's death with hundreds of fans joining in a spontaneous moonwalk , jackson 's signature dance move , in london on friday .
the gathering , which took place outside the liverpool street entrance to the city 's subway system , was arranged using social networking sites like facebook and twitter .
performers at the glastonbury rock and pop festival in southwestern britain also lined up to include tributes to jackson in their songs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans all over the world have come together to grieve australian teenage singer gabriella cilmi , who lives in london , became the first artist to pay tribute to jackson at the annual festival when she slipped a few lines from his hit song " billie jean " into her song " sweet about me . "
meanwhile , former beatle paul mccartney led entertainers , musicians , statesmen and legions of fans around the world in paying tribute to jackson .
mccartney , who performed a duet with jackson in the 1980s , said he was " privileged to have hung out and worked with michael . "
" it 's so sad and shocking , " the ex-beatle said .
" he was a massively talented boy-man with a gentle soul .
his music will be remembered forever and my memories of our time together will be happy ones . "
fans flock to berlin wax museum in berlin , some fans headed to the madame tussauds wax museum , to see a life-size recreation of jackson .
tussauds let fans be photographed next to the figure depicting the former star in a glittering costume at the height of his fame , and provided a condolence book for visitors to sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans were ushered into madame tussauds in berlin also in the german capital , the exclusive adlon hotel , where jackson notoriously hung one of his toddlers out of an upper-floor window , said it " greatly regretted " the death of their former guest .
bee gees star robin gibb called jackson a " wonderful , sensitive human being , " but bemoaned the criticism the singer had come under later in life .
" if even a small portion of the praise that is bestowed on michael jackson now in death was given to him last year , in life , he might well still be with us , " he said .
" this tragedy should teach us a lesson to value and praise those gifts while we still have them in the world . "
a sign of jackson 's undimmed star power came from the fact that 24-hour news channels ran wall-to-wall coverage of his death , while newspapers cleared their front pages for pictures of the late star .
so great was the rush of internet searches for news on the singer , google said it initially thought it was under attack from a virus .

the injection was reportedly administered by his personal physician , who has gone missing since the singer 's death , tmz.com reported .
the website , which was the first to report jackson 's death thursday , said family members had been alarmed at his state and planned to admit him to a rehab facility for his morphine and prescription drug addictions .
the report said that in recent weeks jackson had been too lethargic to rehearse properly for his sold-out comeback shows in london in july .
the performances were an attempt by jackson to revive his career and improve his financial situation .

in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base .
the online version of german news magazine der spiegel wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . "

german chancellor angela merkel , who met with obama earlier friday at the white house , backed the house bill as " an enormous success , which i would not have thought possible a year ago . "
but the legislation has deeply divided us politicians , businesses and even climate groups .
the outcome of the house vote was uncertain to the very last minute : only eight republicans voted in favor and 43 democrats voted against the measure .
the bill now moves to the senate , which could have an even tougher time getting the measure passed .
groups on both sides have vowed to continue pushing for changes as the legislation makes its way through the us congress .
the united states , which together with china emits about half of the world 's greenhouse gases , has long faced pressure from other governments to more aggressively reduce its carbon footprint .
the mandatory emissions curbs approved friday were long resisted by former president george w. bush .
obama hopes a cap-and-trade system will cut us emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels - about 7 percent below 1990 levels - by 2020 , and nearly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
the obama administration also hopes the bill will bolster the country 's bargaining position at a critical meeting in copenhagen in december , where governments are expected to thrash out a new global treaty to combat climate change. dfm / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's now nearing 19 years , 5.8 billion miles -lrb- 9.3 billion kilometers -rrb- and still going .
sixteen months ago , the two space agencies announced that after years of over-performance ulysses was finally freezing up and would die in a matter of weeks .

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .
and , when it was advertised by code in the newspaper - in the frankfurt allgemeine , i think - then the suspicion became firmer .
i found it rather disconcerting .
i do n't know the background .
here , it 's possible that the museum has been used as a means to an end . interview : sabine oelze -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : ian p. johnson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel , who met with obama earlier friday at the white house , backed the house bill as " an enormous success , which i would not have thought possible a year ago . "
but the legislation has deeply divided us politicians , businesses and even climate groups .
the outcome of the house vote was uncertain to the very last minute : only eight republicans voted in favor and 43 democrats voted against the measure .
the bill now moves to the senate , which could have an even tougher time getting the measure passed .
groups on both sides have vowed to continue pushing for changes as the legislation makes its way through the us congress .
the united states , which together with china emits about half of the world 's greenhouse gases , has long faced pressure from other governments to more aggressively reduce its carbon footprint .
the mandatory emissions curbs approved friday were long resisted by former president george w. bush .
obama hopes a cap-and-trade system will cut us emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels - about 7 percent below 1990 levels - by 2020 , and nearly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
the obama administration also hopes the bill will bolster the country 's bargaining position at a critical meeting in copenhagen in december , where governments are expected to thrash out a new global treaty to combat climate change. dfm / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are concerned about the aftermath of the iranian presidential election , " the ministers from the world 's richest group of nations said in a statement .
" we fully respect the sovereignty of iran .
at the same time we deplore post-election violence which led to the loss of lives of iranian civilians and urge iran to respect fundamental human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in trieste layed the groundwork for the g8 summit next month the g8 statement further urged the iranian government to " guarantee that the will of the iranian people is reflected in the electoral process . "
the statement did not cast doubt on the election or call for a re-count .
tehran responded to the statement saying it was interfering and hasty .
the french foreign minister bernar kouchner admitted that the final declaration was a compromise between the more conciliatory russian position and the tougher european union stand .
" it 's obvious that we were not in agreement on the situation in iran , " kouchner said .
" we are united on the nuclear issue and that 's positive . "
the g8 ministers criticized north korea 's nuclear and missile tests and urged the reclusive nation to return to the negotiating table .
afghan elections and drug policy the ministers stressed that the presidential elections in afgahnistan scheduled for august should be fair , credible and peaceful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug eradication efforts in afghanistan have not produced results " the group emphasized the importance of credible , inclusive and secure elections that reflect the will of the afghan people , " said a statement from the group of 20 countries and organizations known as the afghanistan-pakistan international support group .
another topic of discussion at the meetings in trieste was the afghan drug eradication issue .
the us envoy to the region richard holbrooke said that the previous eradication efforts had been largely unsuccessful .
" the western policies against the opium crop , the poppy crop , have been a failure , " holbrooke told reuters .
" they did not result in any damage to the taliban , but they put farmers out of work . "
" we are not going to support crop eradication .
we 're going to phase it out , " he said adding that the emphasis from now on would be on intercepting the drugs and the chemicals needed to make them and going after drug lords .
the peace process the meetings in trieste were originally set to focus on afghanistan , pakistan and the middle east peace process , but the crisis in iran topped the agenda .
in a statement concerning the peace process , the ministers called on israel to halt building jewish settlements in palestinian territories , saying that it is one of the key elements in reviving the efforts toward peace in the area .
the talks in trieste are laying the groundwork for the g8 summit that will take place in the town of l 'aquila from july 8-10. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel , who met with obama earlier friday at the white house , backed the house bill as " an enormous success , which i would not have thought possible a year ago . "
but the legislation has deeply divided us politicians , businesses and even climate groups .
the outcome of the house vote was uncertain to the very last minute : only eight republicans voted in favor and 43 democrats voted against the measure .
the bill now moves to the senate , which could have an even tougher time getting the measure passed .
groups on both sides have vowed to continue pushing for changes as the legislation makes its way through the us congress .
the united states , which together with china emits about half of the world 's greenhouse gases , has long faced pressure from other governments to more aggressively reduce its carbon footprint .
the mandatory emissions curbs approved friday were long resisted by former president george w. bush .
obama hopes a cap-and-trade system will cut us emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels - about 7 percent below 1990 levels - by 2020 , and nearly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
the obama administration also hopes the bill will bolster the country 's bargaining position at a critical meeting in copenhagen in december , where governments are expected to thrash out a new global treaty to combat climate change. dfm / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we see it and we condemn it , " obama said . " the rights of the iranian people to assemble , to speak freely , to have their voices heard , those are universal aspirations . " he added that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's chief rival , former prime minister mir hossein mousavi , had " captured the imagination " of iranians who want to open up to the west . the us president made the comments in a joint white house appearance friday with the german chancellor after the two had held private talks . obama went on to hail the iranian people : " their bravery in the face of brutality is a testament to their enduring pursuit of justice .

" that includes working with the former cold war enemy to reduce " our joint commitment to reducing our nuclear arsenal and strengthening the global nonproliferation regime .

" " it is my hope that the united states will match that commitment today , " obama said as the us house of representatives prepared to vote later in the afternoon on a landmark climate bill . this is merkel 's first visit to the us since obama took office , but it 's the third time the two leaders have met for face-to-face talks . earlier , merkel promised the us president her support in his international endeavors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 27.06.2009 african elites ignore poverty exacerbating the continent 's problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeletsi mbeki , the former south african president 's brother , says africa 's elites are damaging the country in his latest book moeletsi mbeki blames african elites for not doing enough against poverty on the continent .
the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

german chancellor angela merkel , who met with obama earlier friday at the white house , backed the house bill as " an enormous success , which i would not have thought possible a year ago . "
but the legislation has deeply divided us politicians , businesses and even climate groups .
the outcome of the house vote was uncertain to the very last minute : only eight republicans voted in favor and 43 democrats voted against the measure .
the bill now moves to the senate , which could have an even tougher time getting the measure passed .
groups on both sides have vowed to continue pushing for changes as the legislation makes its way through the us congress .
the united states , which together with china emits about half of the world 's greenhouse gases , has long faced pressure from other governments to more aggressively reduce its carbon footprint .
the mandatory emissions curbs approved friday were long resisted by former president george w. bush .
obama hopes a cap-and-trade system will cut us emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels - about 7 percent below 1990 levels - by 2020 , and nearly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
the obama administration also hopes the bill will bolster the country 's bargaining position at a critical meeting in copenhagen in december , where governments are expected to thrash out a new global treaty to combat climate change. dfm / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german president horst koehler thanked hungarians for their solidarity with the east germans and their contributions to german unity .
" i would like to express my gratitude to the hungarian people for their bravery , attitude and support toward the east germans , " he said .

in reality , hungary had already begun to dismantle the iron curtain nearly two months earlier , on may 2 , 1989 .

those who fled found temporary refuge in hungary , poland or czechoslovakia while waiting for an opportunity to travel to west germany .

" we are concerned about the aftermath of the iranian presidential election , " the ministers from the world 's richest group of nations said in a statement .
" we fully respect the sovereignty of iran .
at the same time we deplore post-election violence which led to the loss of lives of iranian civilians and urge iran to respect fundamental human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in trieste layed the groundwork for the g8 summit next month the g8 statement further urged the iranian government to " guarantee that the will of the iranian people is reflected in the electoral process . "
the statement did not cast doubt on the election or call for a re-count .
tehran responded to the statement saying it was interfering and hasty .
the french foreign minister bernar kouchner admitted that the final declaration was a compromise between the more conciliatory russian position and the tougher european union stand .
" it 's obvious that we were not in agreement on the situation in iran , " kouchner said .
" we are united on the nuclear issue and that 's positive . "
the g8 ministers criticized north korea 's nuclear and missile tests and urged the reclusive nation to return to the negotiating table .
afghan elections and drug policy the ministers stressed that the presidential elections in afgahnistan scheduled for august should be fair , credible and peaceful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug eradication efforts in afghanistan have not produced results " the group emphasized the importance of credible , inclusive and secure elections that reflect the will of the afghan people , " said a statement from the group of 20 countries and organizations known as the afghanistan-pakistan international support group .
another topic of discussion at the meetings in trieste was the afghan drug eradication issue .
the us envoy to the region richard holbrooke said that the previous eradication efforts had been largely unsuccessful .
" the western policies against the opium crop , the poppy crop , have been a failure , " holbrooke told reuters .
" they did not result in any damage to the taliban , but they put farmers out of work . "
" we are not going to support crop eradication .
we 're going to phase it out , " he said adding that the emphasis from now on would be on intercepting the drugs and the chemicals needed to make them and going after drug lords .
the peace process the meetings in trieste were originally set to focus on afghanistan , pakistan and the middle east peace process , but the crisis in iran topped the agenda .
in a statement concerning the peace process , the ministers called on israel to halt building jewish settlements in palestinian territories , saying that it is one of the key elements in reviving the efforts toward peace in the area .
the talks in trieste are laying the groundwork for the g8 summit that will take place in the town of l 'aquila from july 8-10. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the local catholic bishop of regensburg earlier accused the group of defying his authority .
father stefan frey , the head of the seminary , told 1,500 guests who had gathered for the ceremony , that they were being criticized by the german catholic church .
" we deplore the verbal bullying we have been receiving in recent days from several german bishops , " frey said .
but he conceded that the group was still operating in what he called a " grey area " under church law .
swedish , polish and swiss seminarians aged 26 to 30 were declared priests in the saturday ceremony .
the schismatic society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican says the sspx has no status in the church the society of pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- consists of catholics who do not agree with the modern developments in the church that were introduced by the second vatican council , including detente with judaism and a conversion of worship from latin to vernacular languages .
ahead of the ordination , the vatican said that the ordinations would not be permissible under church law .
frey , however , said the vatican had not demanded that the society stop administering catholic sacraments .
the pope has urged the sspx to rejoin the church , but has been assailed by other catholics for allowing the traditionalists to use old , anti-jewish prayers .
the group ordained 13 new priests in winona , minnesota last weekend .
international scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson cast doubt on the number of jews who died in the holocaust the sspx was the subject of controversy last year when one of their bishops , richard williamson , said in an interview that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles , especially after it became known that pope benedict xvi had lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other sspx bishops in an attempt to bring the sect closer to rome .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust at the time , even though critics pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter had existed for some time. av / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .
and , when it was advertised by code in the newspaper - in the frankfurt allgemeine , i think - then the suspicion became firmer .
i found it rather disconcerting .
i do n't know the background .
here , it 's possible that the museum has been used as a means to an end . interview : sabine oelze -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : ian p. johnson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel , who met with obama earlier friday at the white house , backed the house bill as " an enormous success , which i would not have thought possible a year ago . "
but the legislation has deeply divided us politicians , businesses and even climate groups .
the outcome of the house vote was uncertain to the very last minute : only eight republicans voted in favor and 43 democrats voted against the measure .
the bill now moves to the senate , which could have an even tougher time getting the measure passed .
groups on both sides have vowed to continue pushing for changes as the legislation makes its way through the us congress .
the united states , which together with china emits about half of the world 's greenhouse gases , has long faced pressure from other governments to more aggressively reduce its carbon footprint .
the mandatory emissions curbs approved friday were long resisted by former president george w. bush .
obama hopes a cap-and-trade system will cut us emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels - about 7 percent below 1990 levels - by 2020 , and nearly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
the obama administration also hopes the bill will bolster the country 's bargaining position at a critical meeting in copenhagen in december , where governments are expected to thrash out a new global treaty to combat climate change. dfm / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .

so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .

initial concerns over foul play have been ruled out . the los angeles county coroner 's office said following an autopsy there were no signs of trauma in jackson 's death , but that additional tests will be needed to determine exactly how the singer died .
" the cause of death has been deferred , " said craig harvey of the coroner 's office .
" the medical examiner has ordered additional testing such as toxicology and other studies . "
harvey said the tests would take four to six weeks to complete .
the outpouring of grief continues following jackson 's death with hundreds of fans joining in a spontaneous moonwalk , jackson 's signature dance move , in london on friday .
the gathering , which took place outside the liverpool street entrance to the city 's subway system , was arranged using social networking sites like facebook and twitter .
performers at the glastonbury rock and pop festival in southwestern britain also lined up to include tributes to jackson in their songs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans all over the world have come together to grieve australian teenage singer gabriella cilmi , who lives in london , became the first artist to pay tribute to jackson at the annual festival when she slipped a few lines from his hit song " billie jean " into her song " sweet about me . "
meanwhile , former beatle paul mccartney led entertainers , musicians , statesmen and legions of fans around the world in paying tribute to jackson .
mccartney , who performed a duet with jackson in the 1980s , said he was " privileged to have hung out and worked with michael . "
" it 's so sad and shocking , " the ex-beatle said .
" he was a massively talented boy-man with a gentle soul .
his music will be remembered forever and my memories of our time together will be happy ones . "
fans flock to berlin wax museum in berlin , some fans headed to the madame tussauds wax museum , to see a life-size recreation of jackson .
tussauds let fans be photographed next to the figure depicting the former star in a glittering costume at the height of his fame , and provided a condolence book for visitors to sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans were ushered into madame tussauds in berlin also in the german capital , the exclusive adlon hotel , where jackson notoriously hung one of his toddlers out of an upper-floor window , said it " greatly regretted " the death of their former guest .
bee gees star robin gibb called jackson a " wonderful , sensitive human being , " but bemoaned the criticism the singer had come under later in life .
" if even a small portion of the praise that is bestowed on michael jackson now in death was given to him last year , in life , he might well still be with us , " he said .
" this tragedy should teach us a lesson to value and praise those gifts while we still have them in the world . "
a sign of jackson 's undimmed star power came from the fact that 24-hour news channels ran wall-to-wall coverage of his death , while newspapers cleared their front pages for pictures of the late star .
so great was the rush of internet searches for news on the singer , google said it initially thought it was under attack from a virus .
bildunterschrift : jackson 's career was controversial at times cause of death unclear website tmz.com , quoting family members , reported that jackson died after being given " a heavy does of morphine . "
the injection was reportedly administered by his personal physician , who has gone missing since the singer 's death , tmz.com reported .
the website , which was the first to report jackson 's death thursday , said family members had been alarmed at his state and planned to admit him to a rehab facility for his morphine and prescription drug addictions .
the report said that in recent weeks jackson had been too lethargic to rehearse properly for his sold-out comeback shows in london in july .
the performances were an attempt by jackson to revive his career and improve his financial situation .

as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time .
in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base .
the online version of german news magazine der spiegel wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . "
on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else … and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many . "
" a comeback has seldom been as necessary as it was in jackson 's case , " wrote german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
though it 's now too late for a comeback , the troubled pop icon leaves behind a generation that has at some point tried to moonwalk and a legacy of young musicians - like beyonce and timberlake - who are carrying on in his footsteps. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the western policies against the opium crop , the poppy crop , have been a failure , " holbrooke told reuters .
" they did not result in any damage to the taliban , but they put farmers out of work . "
" we are not going to support crop eradication .
we 're going to phase it out , " he said adding that the emphasis from now on would be on intercepting the drugs and the chemicals needed to make them and going after drug lords .
the peace process the meetings in trieste were originally set to focus on afghanistan , pakistan and the middle east peace process , but the crisis in iran topped the agenda .
in a statement concerning the peace process , the ministers called on israel to halt building jewish settlements in palestinian territories , saying that it is one of the key elements in reviving the efforts toward peace in the area .

another topic of discussion at the meetings in trieste was the afghan drug eradication issue .
the us envoy to the region richard holbrooke said that the previous eradication efforts had been largely unsuccessful .
" the western policies against the opium crop , the poppy crop , have been a failure , " holbrooke told reuters .
" they did not result in any damage to the taliban , but they put farmers out of work . "
" we are not going to support crop eradication .
we 're going to phase it out , " he said adding that the emphasis from now on would be on intercepting the drugs and the chemicals needed to make them and going after drug lords .
the peace process the meetings in trieste were originally set to focus on afghanistan , pakistan and the middle east peace process , but the crisis in iran topped the agenda .
in a statement concerning the peace process , the ministers called on israel to halt building jewish settlements in palestinian territories , saying that it is one of the key elements in reviving the efforts toward peace in the area .
the talks in trieste are laying the groundwork for the g8 summit that will take place in the town of l 'aquila from july 8-10. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 27.06.2009 african elites ignore poverty exacerbating the continent 's problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeletsi mbeki , the former south african president 's brother , says africa 's elites are damaging the country in his latest book moeletsi mbeki blames african elites for not doing enough against poverty on the continent .
the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

in reality , hungary had already begun to dismantle the iron curtain nearly two months earlier , on may 2 , 1989 .
still , photographs of the symbolic cutting of the wire were published around the world , inspiring some east germans to leave their country .
those who fled found temporary refuge in hungary , poland or czechoslovakia while waiting for an opportunity to travel to west germany .

the local catholic bishop of regensburg earlier accused the group of defying his authority .
father stefan frey , the head of the seminary , told 1,500 guests who had gathered for the ceremony , that they were being criticized by the german catholic church .
" we deplore the verbal bullying we have been receiving in recent days from several german bishops , " frey said .
but he conceded that the group was still operating in what he called a " grey area " under church law .
swedish , polish and swiss seminarians aged 26 to 30 were declared priests in the saturday ceremony .
the schismatic society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican says the sspx has no status in the church the society of pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- consists of catholics who do not agree with the modern developments in the church that were introduced by the second vatican council , including detente with judaism and a conversion of worship from latin to vernacular languages .
ahead of the ordination , the vatican said that the ordinations would not be permissible under church law .
frey , however , said the vatican had not demanded that the society stop administering catholic sacraments .
the pope has urged the sspx to rejoin the church , but has been assailed by other catholics for allowing the traditionalists to use old , anti-jewish prayers .
the group ordained 13 new priests in winona , minnesota last weekend .
international scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson cast doubt on the number of jews who died in the holocaust the sspx was the subject of controversy last year when one of their bishops , richard williamson , said in an interview that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles , especially after it became known that pope benedict xvi had lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other sspx bishops in an attempt to bring the sect closer to rome .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust at the time , even though critics pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter had existed for some time. av / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

initial concerns over foul play have been ruled out . the los angeles county coroner 's office said following an autopsy there were no signs of trauma in jackson 's death , but that additional tests will be needed to determine exactly how the singer died .
" the cause of death has been deferred , " said craig harvey of the coroner 's office .
" the medical examiner has ordered additional testing such as toxicology and other studies . "
harvey said the tests would take four to six weeks to complete .
the outpouring of grief continues following jackson 's death with hundreds of fans joining in a spontaneous moonwalk , jackson 's signature dance move , in london on friday .
the gathering , which took place outside the liverpool street entrance to the city 's subway system , was arranged using social networking sites like facebook and twitter .
performers at the glastonbury rock and pop festival in southwestern britain also lined up to include tributes to jackson in their songs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans all over the world have come together to grieve australian teenage singer gabriella cilmi , who lives in london , became the first artist to pay tribute to jackson at the annual festival when she slipped a few lines from his hit song " billie jean " into her song " sweet about me . "
meanwhile , former beatle paul mccartney led entertainers , musicians , statesmen and legions of fans around the world in paying tribute to jackson .
mccartney , who performed a duet with jackson in the 1980s , said he was " privileged to have hung out and worked with michael . "
" it 's so sad and shocking , " the ex-beatle said .
" he was a massively talented boy-man with a gentle soul .

but it 's now nearing 19 years , 5.8 billion miles -lrb- 9.3 billion kilometers -rrb- and still going .
sixteen months ago , the two space agencies announced that after years of over-performance ulysses was finally freezing up and would die in a matter of weeks .

german chancellor angela merkel , who met with obama earlier friday at the white house , backed the house bill as " an enormous success , which i would not have thought possible a year ago . "
but the legislation has deeply divided us politicians , businesses and even climate groups .
the outcome of the house vote was uncertain to the very last minute : only eight republicans voted in favor and 43 democrats voted against the measure .
the bill now moves to the senate , which could have an even tougher time getting the measure passed .
groups on both sides have vowed to continue pushing for changes as the legislation makes its way through the us congress .
the united states , which together with china emits about half of the world 's greenhouse gases , has long faced pressure from other governments to more aggressively reduce its carbon footprint .
the mandatory emissions curbs approved friday were long resisted by former president george w. bush .
obama hopes a cap-and-trade system will cut us emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels - about 7 percent below 1990 levels - by 2020 , and nearly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
the obama administration also hopes the bill will bolster the country 's bargaining position at a critical meeting in copenhagen in december , where governments are expected to thrash out a new global treaty to combat climate change. dfm / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

initial concerns over foul play have been ruled out . the los angeles county coroner 's office said following an autopsy there were no signs of trauma in jackson 's death , but that additional tests will be needed to determine exactly how the singer died .
" the cause of death has been deferred , " said craig harvey of the coroner 's office .
" the medical examiner has ordered additional testing such as toxicology and other studies . "
harvey said the tests would take four to six weeks to complete .
the outpouring of grief continues following jackson 's death with hundreds of fans joining in a spontaneous moonwalk , jackson 's signature dance move , in london on friday .
the gathering , which took place outside the liverpool street entrance to the city 's subway system , was arranged using social networking sites like facebook and twitter .
performers at the glastonbury rock and pop festival in southwestern britain also lined up to include tributes to jackson in their songs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans all over the world have come together to grieve australian teenage singer gabriella cilmi , who lives in london , became the first artist to pay tribute to jackson at the annual festival when she slipped a few lines from his hit song " billie jean " into her song " sweet about me . "
meanwhile , former beatle paul mccartney led entertainers , musicians , statesmen and legions of fans around the world in paying tribute to jackson .
mccartney , who performed a duet with jackson in the 1980s , said he was " privileged to have hung out and worked with michael . "
" it 's so sad and shocking , " the ex-beatle said .
" he was a massively talented boy-man with a gentle soul .
his music will be remembered forever and my memories of our time together will be happy ones . "
fans flock to berlin wax museum in berlin , some fans headed to the madame tussauds wax museum , to see a life-size recreation of jackson .
tussauds let fans be photographed next to the figure depicting the former star in a glittering costume at the height of his fame , and provided a condolence book for visitors to sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans were ushered into madame tussauds in berlin also in the german capital , the exclusive adlon hotel , where jackson notoriously hung one of his toddlers out of an upper-floor window , said it " greatly regretted " the death of their former guest .
bee gees star robin gibb called jackson a " wonderful , sensitive human being , " but bemoaned the criticism the singer had come under later in life .
" if even a small portion of the praise that is bestowed on michael jackson now in death was given to him last year , in life , he might well still be with us , " he said .
" this tragedy should teach us a lesson to value and praise those gifts while we still have them in the world . "
a sign of jackson 's undimmed star power came from the fact that 24-hour news channels ran wall-to-wall coverage of his death , while newspapers cleared their front pages for pictures of the late star .
so great was the rush of internet searches for news on the singer , google said it initially thought it was under attack from a virus .
bildunterschrift : jackson 's career was controversial at times cause of death unclear website tmz.com , quoting family members , reported that jackson died after being given " a heavy does of morphine . "
the injection was reportedly administered by his personal physician , who has gone missing since the singer 's death , tmz.com reported .
the website , which was the first to report jackson 's death thursday , said family members had been alarmed at his state and planned to admit him to a rehab facility for his morphine and prescription drug addictions .
the report said that in recent weeks jackson had been too lethargic to rehearse properly for his sold-out comeback shows in london in july .
the performances were an attempt by jackson to revive his career and improve his financial situation .

as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time .
in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base .
the online version of german news magazine der spiegel wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . "
on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else … and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many . "
" a comeback has seldom been as necessary as it was in jackson 's case , " wrote german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
though it 's now too late for a comeback , the troubled pop icon leaves behind a generation that has at some point tried to moonwalk and a legacy of young musicians - like beyonce and timberlake - who are carrying on in his footsteps. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bee gees star robin gibb called jackson a " wonderful , sensitive human being , " but bemoaned the criticism the singer had come under later in life .
" if even a small portion of the praise that is bestowed on michael jackson now in death was given to him last year , in life , he might well still be with us , " he said .
" this tragedy should teach us a lesson to value and praise those gifts while we still have them in the world . "
a sign of jackson 's undimmed star power came from the fact that 24-hour news channels ran wall-to-wall coverage of his death , while newspapers cleared their front pages for pictures of the late star .
so great was the rush of internet searches for news on the singer , google said it initially thought it was under attack from a virus .
bildunterschrift : jackson 's career was controversial at times cause of death unclear website tmz.com , quoting family members , reported that jackson died after being given " a heavy does of morphine . "
the injection was reportedly administered by his personal physician , who has gone missing since the singer 's death , tmz.com reported .
the website , which was the first to report jackson 's death thursday , said family members had been alarmed at his state and planned to admit him to a rehab facility for his morphine and prescription drug addictions .
the report said that in recent weeks jackson had been too lethargic to rehearse properly for his sold-out comeback shows in london in july .
the performances were an attempt by jackson to revive his career and improve his financial situation .

as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time .
in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base .
the online version of german news magazine der spiegel wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . "
on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else … and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many . "
" a comeback has seldom been as necessary as it was in jackson 's case , " wrote german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
though it 's now too late for a comeback , the troubled pop icon leaves behind a generation that has at some point tried to moonwalk and a legacy of young musicians - like beyonce and timberlake - who are carrying on in his footsteps. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we wo n't let ourselves be blackmailed , " said porsche chairman wolfgang porsche in a statement on saturday , june 27 .
" these are not the manners that encourage a spirit of togetherness . "
according to industry sources quoted in the german magazine der spiegel , volkswagen and the german state of lower saxony , which also owns a portion of volkswagen , have given porsche two days to accept the proposal for cross-ownership that would eventually lead to a merger or face bankruptcy .
" ultimatums never achieve anything , " porsche said , calling on " the initiators " to " calm down and pursue their proposals in closed-door talks , not via headlines . "
failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche , right , and vw 's ferdinand piech play high-stakes poker porsche is in a financial bind because it tried to engineer a takeover of volkswagen in 2008 but failed as the global economic downturn worsened .
it currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen yet it does not have management control .
volkswagen , the larger of the two , has proposed to take over 49.9 percent of porsche 's factories and brand for 3 to 4 billion euros , with the rest of the shares staying in porsche 's hands .
if porsche rejects the offer , it will probably see vw demand reimbursement of a 700-million euro loan it provided porsche in march .
porsche - currently carrying a heavy burden of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in debt - prefers a rescue option from the qatari investment authority -lrb- qia -rrb- in exchange for a minority stake in the sports car maker .
the gulf state , however , could either help porsche to win 75-per-cent control - something that would infuriate the vw workforce - or buy expensive vw stock options and leave porsche largely powerless . no help from the government lower saxony , which owns one fifth of volkswagen , said it would welcome qatar as a direct shareholder in vw rather than as a part-owner of porsche 's 51-percent stake in vw . porsche had earlier this year asked the german government for a credit of 1.75 billion euros but was turned down . the sports car maker is owned jointly by the porsche and piech families .
with ferdinand piech also being head of the supervisory board of volkswagen , the ongoing corporate struggle is also a family drama . porsche is wholly owned by the descendants of founder ferdinand porsche , and while shares are traded on the stock exchange , their owners have no voting rights . a previous attempt to open the company up to middle eastern investors failed .
in 1983 , piech 's brother ernst sold his share to kuwait , but the family immediately objected and bought the stake back , a porsche spokesman said . av / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 27.06.2009 african elites ignore poverty exacerbating the continent 's problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeletsi mbeki , the former south african president 's brother , says africa 's elites are damaging the country in his latest book moeletsi mbeki blames african elites for not doing enough against poverty on the continent .
the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

the local catholic bishop of regensburg earlier accused the group of defying his authority .
father stefan frey , the head of the seminary , told 1,500 guests who had gathered for the ceremony , that they were being criticized by the german catholic church .
" we deplore the verbal bullying we have been receiving in recent days from several german bishops , " frey said .
but he conceded that the group was still operating in what he called a " grey area " under church law .
swedish , polish and swiss seminarians aged 26 to 30 were declared priests in the saturday ceremony .
the schismatic society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican says the sspx has no status in the church the society of pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- consists of catholics who do not agree with the modern developments in the church that were introduced by the second vatican council , including detente with judaism and a conversion of worship from latin to vernacular languages .
ahead of the ordination , the vatican said that the ordinations would not be permissible under church law .
frey , however , said the vatican had not demanded that the society stop administering catholic sacraments .
the pope has urged the sspx to rejoin the church , but has been assailed by other catholics for allowing the traditionalists to use old , anti-jewish prayers .
the group ordained 13 new priests in winona , minnesota last weekend .
international scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson cast doubt on the number of jews who died in the holocaust the sspx was the subject of controversy last year when one of their bishops , richard williamson , said in an interview that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles , especially after it became known that pope benedict xvi had lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other sspx bishops in an attempt to bring the sect closer to rome .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust at the time , even though critics pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter had existed for some time. av / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the local catholic bishop of regensburg earlier accused the group of defying his authority .
father stefan frey , the head of the seminary , told 1,500 guests who had gathered for the ceremony , that they were being criticized by the german catholic church .
" we deplore the verbal bullying we have been receiving in recent days from several german bishops , " frey said .
but he conceded that the group was still operating in what he called a " grey area " under church law .
swedish , polish and swiss seminarians aged 26 to 30 were declared priests in the saturday ceremony .
the schismatic society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican says the sspx has no status in the church the society of pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- consists of catholics who do not agree with the modern developments in the church that were introduced by the second vatican council , including detente with judaism and a conversion of worship from latin to vernacular languages .
ahead of the ordination , the vatican said that the ordinations would not be permissible under church law .
frey , however , said the vatican had not demanded that the society stop administering catholic sacraments .
the pope has urged the sspx to rejoin the church , but has been assailed by other catholics for allowing the traditionalists to use old , anti-jewish prayers .
the group ordained 13 new priests in winona , minnesota last weekend .
international scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson cast doubt on the number of jews who died in the holocaust the sspx was the subject of controversy last year when one of their bishops , richard williamson , said in an interview that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles , especially after it became known that pope benedict xvi had lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other sspx bishops in an attempt to bring the sect closer to rome .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust at the time , even though critics pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter had existed for some time. av / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 27.06.2009 porsche refuses vw 's ultimatum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ongoing struggle between porsche and vw is heating up germany 's financially troubled sports car maker porsche has rejected what it calls a humiliating ultimatum from rival volkswagen , but the corporate power struggle between the two companies is anything but over . " we wo n't let ourselves be blackmailed , " said porsche chairman wolfgang porsche in a statement on saturday , june 27 .
" these are not the manners that encourage a spirit of togetherness . "
according to industry sources quoted in the german magazine der spiegel , volkswagen and the german state of lower saxony , which also owns a portion of volkswagen , have given porsche two days to accept the proposal for cross-ownership that would eventually lead to a merger or face bankruptcy .
" ultimatums never achieve anything , " porsche said , calling on " the initiators " to " calm down and pursue their proposals in closed-door talks , not via headlines . "
failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang porsche , right , and vw 's ferdinand piech play high-stakes poker porsche is in a financial bind because it tried to engineer a takeover of volkswagen in 2008 but failed as the global economic downturn worsened .
it currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen yet it does not have management control .
volkswagen , the larger of the two , has proposed to take over 49.9 percent of porsche 's factories and brand for 3 to 4 billion euros , with the rest of the shares staying in porsche 's hands .
if porsche rejects the offer , it will probably see vw demand reimbursement of a 700-million euro loan it provided porsche in march .
porsche - currently carrying a heavy burden of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- in debt - prefers a rescue option from the qatari investment authority -lrb- qia -rrb- in exchange for a minority stake in the sports car maker .
the gulf state , however , could either help porsche to win 75-per-cent control - something that would infuriate the vw workforce - or buy expensive vw stock options and leave porsche largely powerless . no help from the government lower saxony , which owns one fifth of volkswagen , said it would welcome qatar as a direct shareholder in vw rather than as a part-owner of porsche 's 51-percent stake in vw . porsche had earlier this year asked the german government for a credit of 1.75 billion euros but was turned down . the sports car maker is owned jointly by the porsche and piech families .
with ferdinand piech also being head of the supervisory board of volkswagen , the ongoing corporate struggle is also a family drama . porsche is wholly owned by the descendants of founder ferdinand porsche , and while shares are traded on the stock exchange , their owners have no voting rights . a previous attempt to open the company up to middle eastern investors failed .
in 1983 , piech 's brother ernst sold his share to kuwait , but the family immediately objected and bought the stake back , a porsche spokesman said . av / dpa / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de snubbed by german government , porsche looks elsewhere for help with germany 's state-owned kfw bank increasingly unlikely to come to the rescue of porsche , the ailing car maker has reportedly entered talks with rival daimler and the gulf state of qatar in an attempt to win investors .
-lrb- 20.06.2009 -rrb- porsche sales plummet 15 percent as luxury car demand stalls luxury german sports car maker porsche has seen nearly a billion euros wiped from its sales in the last nine months in signs of further trouble for high-end auto manufacturers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 27.06.2009 showing modigliani is risky , says art expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the origin of ' reclining nude ' -lrb- 1918 -rrb- is in dispute at a retrospective exhibition of works by artist amedeo modigliani in bonn , at least one of the paintings is said to be fake .
the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .
and , when it was advertised by code in the newspaper - in the frankfurt allgemeine , i think - then the suspicion became firmer .
i found it rather disconcerting .
i do n't know the background .
here , it 's possible that the museum has been used as a means to an end . interview : sabine oelze -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : ian p. johnson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .
and , when it was advertised by code in the newspaper - in the frankfurt allgemeine , i think - then the suspicion became firmer .
i found it rather disconcerting .
i do n't know the background .
here , it 's possible that the museum has been used as a means to an end . interview : sabine oelze -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : ian p. johnson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are concerned about the aftermath of the iranian presidential election , " the ministers from the world 's richest group of nations said in a statement .
" we fully respect the sovereignty of iran .
at the same time we deplore post-election violence which led to the loss of lives of iranian civilians and urge iran to respect fundamental human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in trieste layed the groundwork for the g8 summit next month the g8 statement further urged the iranian government to " guarantee that the will of the iranian people is reflected in the electoral process . "
the statement did not cast doubt on the election or call for a re-count .
tehran responded to the statement saying it was interfering and hasty .
the french foreign minister bernar kouchner admitted that the final declaration was a compromise between the more conciliatory russian position and the tougher european union stand .
" it 's obvious that we were not in agreement on the situation in iran , " kouchner said .
" we are united on the nuclear issue and that 's positive . "
the g8 ministers criticized north korea 's nuclear and missile tests and urged the reclusive nation to return to the negotiating table .
afghan elections and drug policy the ministers stressed that the presidential elections in afgahnistan scheduled for august should be fair , credible and peaceful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug eradication efforts in afghanistan have not produced results " the group emphasized the importance of credible , inclusive and secure elections that reflect the will of the afghan people , " said a statement from the group of 20 countries and organizations known as the afghanistan-pakistan international support group .
another topic of discussion at the meetings in trieste was the afghan drug eradication issue .
the us envoy to the region richard holbrooke said that the previous eradication efforts had been largely unsuccessful .
" the western policies against the opium crop , the poppy crop , have been a failure , " holbrooke told reuters .
" they did not result in any damage to the taliban , but they put farmers out of work . "
" we are not going to support crop eradication .
we 're going to phase it out , " he said adding that the emphasis from now on would be on intercepting the drugs and the chemicals needed to make them and going after drug lords .
the peace process the meetings in trieste were originally set to focus on afghanistan , pakistan and the middle east peace process , but the crisis in iran topped the agenda .
in a statement concerning the peace process , the ministers called on israel to halt building jewish settlements in palestinian territories , saying that it is one of the key elements in reviving the efforts toward peace in the area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 27.06.2009 african elites ignore poverty exacerbating the continent 's problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeletsi mbeki , the former south african president 's brother , says africa 's elites are damaging the country in his latest book moeletsi mbeki blames african elites for not doing enough against poverty on the continent .
the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

" he added that iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's chief rival , former prime minister mir hossein mousavi , had " captured the imagination " of iranians who want to open up to the west . the us president made the comments in a joint white house appearance friday with the german chancellor after the two had held private talks . obama went on to hail the iranian people : " their bravery in the face of brutality is a testament to their enduring pursuit of justice .

" " it is my hope that the united states will match that commitment today , " obama said as the us house of representatives prepared to vote later in the afternoon on a landmark climate bill . this is merkel 's first visit to the us since obama took office , but it 's the third time the two leaders have met for face-to-face talks . earlier , merkel promised the us president her support in his international endeavors .

german chancellor angela merkel , who met with obama earlier friday at the white house , backed the house bill as " an enormous success , which i would not have thought possible a year ago . "
but the legislation has deeply divided us politicians , businesses and even climate groups .
the outcome of the house vote was uncertain to the very last minute : only eight republicans voted in favor and 43 democrats voted against the measure .
the bill now moves to the senate , which could have an even tougher time getting the measure passed .
groups on both sides have vowed to continue pushing for changes as the legislation makes its way through the us congress .
the united states , which together with china emits about half of the world 's greenhouse gases , has long faced pressure from other governments to more aggressively reduce its carbon footprint .
the mandatory emissions curbs approved friday were long resisted by former president george w. bush .
obama hopes a cap-and-trade system will cut us emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels - about 7 percent below 1990 levels - by 2020 , and nearly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
the obama administration also hopes the bill will bolster the country 's bargaining position at a critical meeting in copenhagen in december , where governments are expected to thrash out a new global treaty to combat climate change. dfm / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .
and , when it was advertised by code in the newspaper - in the frankfurt allgemeine , i think - then the suspicion became firmer .
i found it rather disconcerting .
i do n't know the background .

the local catholic bishop of regensburg earlier accused the group of defying his authority .
father stefan frey , the head of the seminary , told 1,500 guests who had gathered for the ceremony , that they were being criticized by the german catholic church .
" we deplore the verbal bullying we have been receiving in recent days from several german bishops , " frey said .
but he conceded that the group was still operating in what he called a " grey area " under church law .
swedish , polish and swiss seminarians aged 26 to 30 were declared priests in the saturday ceremony .
the schismatic society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican says the sspx has no status in the church the society of pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- consists of catholics who do not agree with the modern developments in the church that were introduced by the second vatican council , including detente with judaism and a conversion of worship from latin to vernacular languages .
ahead of the ordination , the vatican said that the ordinations would not be permissible under church law .
frey , however , said the vatican had not demanded that the society stop administering catholic sacraments .
the pope has urged the sspx to rejoin the church , but has been assailed by other catholics for allowing the traditionalists to use old , anti-jewish prayers .
the group ordained 13 new priests in winona , minnesota last weekend .
international scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson cast doubt on the number of jews who died in the holocaust the sspx was the subject of controversy last year when one of their bishops , richard williamson , said in an interview that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles , especially after it became known that pope benedict xvi had lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other sspx bishops in an attempt to bring the sect closer to rome .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust at the time , even though critics pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter had existed for some time. av / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel , who met with obama earlier friday at the white house , backed the house bill as " an enormous success , which i would not have thought possible a year ago . "
but the legislation has deeply divided us politicians , businesses and even climate groups .
the outcome of the house vote was uncertain to the very last minute : only eight republicans voted in favor and 43 democrats voted against the measure .
the bill now moves to the senate , which could have an even tougher time getting the measure passed .
groups on both sides have vowed to continue pushing for changes as the legislation makes its way through the us congress .
the united states , which together with china emits about half of the world 's greenhouse gases , has long faced pressure from other governments to more aggressively reduce its carbon footprint .
the mandatory emissions curbs approved friday were long resisted by former president george w. bush .
obama hopes a cap-and-trade system will cut us emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels - about 7 percent below 1990 levels - by 2020 , and nearly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
the obama administration also hopes the bill will bolster the country 's bargaining position at a critical meeting in copenhagen in december , where governments are expected to thrash out a new global treaty to combat climate change. dfm / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are concerned about the aftermath of the iranian presidential election , " the ministers from the world 's richest group of nations said in a statement .
" we fully respect the sovereignty of iran .
at the same time we deplore post-election violence which led to the loss of lives of iranian civilians and urge iran to respect fundamental human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in trieste layed the groundwork for the g8 summit next month the g8 statement further urged the iranian government to " guarantee that the will of the iranian people is reflected in the electoral process . "
the statement did not cast doubt on the election or call for a re-count .
tehran responded to the statement saying it was interfering and hasty .
the french foreign minister bernar kouchner admitted that the final declaration was a compromise between the more conciliatory russian position and the tougher european union stand .
" it 's obvious that we were not in agreement on the situation in iran , " kouchner said .
" we are united on the nuclear issue and that 's positive . "
the g8 ministers criticized north korea 's nuclear and missile tests and urged the reclusive nation to return to the negotiating table .
afghan elections and drug policy the ministers stressed that the presidential elections in afgahnistan scheduled for august should be fair , credible and peaceful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug eradication efforts in afghanistan have not produced results " the group emphasized the importance of credible , inclusive and secure elections that reflect the will of the afghan people , " said a statement from the group of 20 countries and organizations known as the afghanistan-pakistan international support group .
another topic of discussion at the meetings in trieste was the afghan drug eradication issue .
the us envoy to the region richard holbrooke said that the previous eradication efforts had been largely unsuccessful .
" the western policies against the opium crop , the poppy crop , have been a failure , " holbrooke told reuters .
" they did not result in any damage to the taliban , but they put farmers out of work . "
" we are not going to support crop eradication .
we 're going to phase it out , " he said adding that the emphasis from now on would be on intercepting the drugs and the chemicals needed to make them and going after drug lords .
the peace process the meetings in trieste were originally set to focus on afghanistan , pakistan and the middle east peace process , but the crisis in iran topped the agenda .
in a statement concerning the peace process , the ministers called on israel to halt building jewish settlements in palestinian territories , saying that it is one of the key elements in reviving the efforts toward peace in the area .
the talks in trieste are laying the groundwork for the g8 summit that will take place in the town of l 'aquila from july 8-10. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are concerned about the aftermath of the iranian presidential election , " the ministers from the world 's richest group of nations said in a statement .
" we fully respect the sovereignty of iran .
at the same time we deplore post-election violence which led to the loss of lives of iranian civilians and urge iran to respect fundamental human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meeting in trieste layed the groundwork for the g8 summit next month the g8 statement further urged the iranian government to " guarantee that the will of the iranian people is reflected in the electoral process . "
the statement did not cast doubt on the election or call for a re-count .
tehran responded to the statement saying it was interfering and hasty .
the french foreign minister bernar kouchner admitted that the final declaration was a compromise between the more conciliatory russian position and the tougher european union stand .
" it 's obvious that we were not in agreement on the situation in iran , " kouchner said .
" we are united on the nuclear issue and that 's positive . "
the g8 ministers criticized north korea 's nuclear and missile tests and urged the reclusive nation to return to the negotiating table .
afghan elections and drug policy the ministers stressed that the presidential elections in afgahnistan scheduled for august should be fair , credible and peaceful .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug eradication efforts in afghanistan have not produced results " the group emphasized the importance of credible , inclusive and secure elections that reflect the will of the afghan people , " said a statement from the group of 20 countries and organizations known as the afghanistan-pakistan international support group .
another topic of discussion at the meetings in trieste was the afghan drug eradication issue .
the us envoy to the region richard holbrooke said that the previous eradication efforts had been largely unsuccessful .
" the western policies against the opium crop , the poppy crop , have been a failure , " holbrooke told reuters .
" they did not result in any damage to the taliban , but they put farmers out of work . "
" we are not going to support crop eradication .
we 're going to phase it out , " he said adding that the emphasis from now on would be on intercepting the drugs and the chemicals needed to make them and going after drug lords .
the peace process the meetings in trieste were originally set to focus on afghanistan , pakistan and the middle east peace process , but the crisis in iran topped the agenda .
in a statement concerning the peace process , the ministers called on israel to halt building jewish settlements in palestinian territories , saying that it is one of the key elements in reviving the efforts toward peace in the area .
the talks in trieste are laying the groundwork for the g8 summit that will take place in the town of l 'aquila from july 8-10. av / reuters / afp / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's already been nine days without seeing any bodies , " munhoz said friday in a televised news conference .
brazilian navy captain giucemar tabosa said french navy ships , however , would maintain their search for beacon signals from the plane 's so-called black boxes .
to date , authorities have recovered 51 bodies and around 600 pieces of wreckage from the airbus a330-200 jetliner , which mysteriously plunged into the atlantic on june 1 en route from rio de janeiro to paris .
air france said thursday that the bodies of the flight captain and a steward had been identified , bringing the number of identified victims to 11 .
the cause of the crash is still unknown and investigations are likely to be limited without the plane 's black boxes , which could give vital information about conditions when the plane went down .
weather and distance from the coast have complicated search efforts from the outset , and officials have said it will be difficult to locate the black boxes .
the devices will stop emitting audio signals within a week , at which point they will be almost impossible to locate .
the french agency probing the mid-atlantic crash has said it would release an initial report on its findings on july 2. dfm / afp / reuters editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

initial concerns over foul play have been ruled out . the los angeles county coroner 's office said following an autopsy there were no signs of trauma in jackson 's death , but that additional tests will be needed to determine exactly how the singer died .
" the cause of death has been deferred , " said craig harvey of the coroner 's office .
" the medical examiner has ordered additional testing such as toxicology and other studies . "
harvey said the tests would take four to six weeks to complete .
the outpouring of grief continues following jackson 's death with hundreds of fans joining in a spontaneous moonwalk , jackson 's signature dance move , in london on friday .
the gathering , which took place outside the liverpool street entrance to the city 's subway system , was arranged using social networking sites like facebook and twitter .
performers at the glastonbury rock and pop festival in southwestern britain also lined up to include tributes to jackson in their songs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans all over the world have come together to grieve australian teenage singer gabriella cilmi , who lives in london , became the first artist to pay tribute to jackson at the annual festival when she slipped a few lines from his hit song " billie jean " into her song " sweet about me . "
meanwhile , former beatle paul mccartney led entertainers , musicians , statesmen and legions of fans around the world in paying tribute to jackson .
mccartney , who performed a duet with jackson in the 1980s , said he was " privileged to have hung out and worked with michael . "
" it 's so sad and shocking , " the ex-beatle said .
" he was a massively talented boy-man with a gentle soul .
his music will be remembered forever and my memories of our time together will be happy ones . "
fans flock to berlin wax museum in berlin , some fans headed to the madame tussauds wax museum , to see a life-size recreation of jackson .
tussauds let fans be photographed next to the figure depicting the former star in a glittering costume at the height of his fame , and provided a condolence book for visitors to sign .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans were ushered into madame tussauds in berlin also in the german capital , the exclusive adlon hotel , where jackson notoriously hung one of his toddlers out of an upper-floor window , said it " greatly regretted " the death of their former guest .
bee gees star robin gibb called jackson a " wonderful , sensitive human being , " but bemoaned the criticism the singer had come under later in life .
" if even a small portion of the praise that is bestowed on michael jackson now in death was given to him last year , in life , he might well still be with us , " he said .
" this tragedy should teach us a lesson to value and praise those gifts while we still have them in the world . "
a sign of jackson 's undimmed star power came from the fact that 24-hour news channels ran wall-to-wall coverage of his death , while newspapers cleared their front pages for pictures of the late star .
so great was the rush of internet searches for news on the singer , google said it initially thought it was under attack from a virus .
bildunterschrift : jackson 's career was controversial at times cause of death unclear website tmz.com , quoting family members , reported that jackson died after being given " a heavy does of morphine . "
the injection was reportedly administered by his personal physician , who has gone missing since the singer 's death , tmz.com reported .
the website , which was the first to report jackson 's death thursday , said family members had been alarmed at his state and planned to admit him to a rehab facility for his morphine and prescription drug addictions .
the report said that in recent weeks jackson had been too lethargic to rehearse properly for his sold-out comeback shows in london in july .
the performances were an attempt by jackson to revive his career and improve his financial situation .

as an adult , jackson moved on to a successful - and often controversial - solo career .
this career peaked with his 1982 record " thriller , " which is the best selling album of all time .
in later life jackson struggled with a series of court cases and allegations about his private life , damaging his career and his financial situation , but he remained a popular character with an enormous fan base .
the online version of german news magazine der spiegel wrote that jackson had two faces : one was " the monster , more alien than human , lifted , pale and in the end as emaciated as a skeleton . "
on the other hand , there was " the genius that reinvented pop , sold more albums than anyone else … and was admired by the masses - in particular by his musical heirs , who never would have existed without his influence and who are now mourning his passing with an unequalled flood of condolence : beyonce , usher , justin timberlake , to name three of many . "
" a comeback has seldom been as necessary as it was in jackson 's case , " wrote german daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
though it 's now too late for a comeback , the troubled pop icon leaves behind a generation that has at some point tried to moonwalk and a legacy of young musicians - like beyonce and timberlake - who are carrying on in his footsteps. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the local catholic bishop of regensburg earlier accused the group of defying his authority .
father stefan frey , the head of the seminary , told 1,500 guests who had gathered for the ceremony , that they were being criticized by the german catholic church .
" we deplore the verbal bullying we have been receiving in recent days from several german bishops , " frey said .
but he conceded that the group was still operating in what he called a " grey area " under church law .
swedish , polish and swiss seminarians aged 26 to 30 were declared priests in the saturday ceremony .
the schismatic society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican says the sspx has no status in the church the society of pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- consists of catholics who do not agree with the modern developments in the church that were introduced by the second vatican council , including detente with judaism and a conversion of worship from latin to vernacular languages .
ahead of the ordination , the vatican said that the ordinations would not be permissible under church law .
frey , however , said the vatican had not demanded that the society stop administering catholic sacraments .
the pope has urged the sspx to rejoin the church , but has been assailed by other catholics for allowing the traditionalists to use old , anti-jewish prayers .
the group ordained 13 new priests in winona , minnesota last weekend .
international scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson cast doubt on the number of jews who died in the holocaust the sspx was the subject of controversy last year when one of their bishops , richard williamson , said in an interview that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles , especially after it became known that pope benedict xvi had lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other sspx bishops in an attempt to bring the sect closer to rome .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust at the time , even though critics pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter had existed for some time. av / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .
and , when it was advertised by code in the newspaper - in the frankfurt allgemeine , i think - then the suspicion became firmer .

sixteen months ago , the two space agencies announced that after years of over-performance ulysses was finally freezing up and would die in a matter of weeks .
yet somehow the probe kept operating , sending important scientific information about an extraordinarily quiet year for sunspots and solar wind .
but all that really will end after the space agencies announced friday they will finally flick the off switch on ulysses ' transmitter at the end of june , signaling the end of the road for the probe that kept on keeping on .
officials said issues with power , location and antennae made ulysses no longer useful. dfm / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .
and , when it was advertised by code in the newspaper - in the frankfurt allgemeine , i think - then the suspicion became firmer .
i found it rather disconcerting .
i do n't know the background .
here , it 's possible that the museum has been used as a means to an end . interview : sabine oelze -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : ian p. johnson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

initial concerns over foul play have been ruled out . the los angeles county coroner 's office said following an autopsy there were no signs of trauma in jackson 's death , but that additional tests will be needed to determine exactly how the singer died .
" the cause of death has been deferred , " said craig harvey of the coroner 's office .
" the medical examiner has ordered additional testing such as toxicology and other studies . "

initial concerns over foul play have been ruled out . the los angeles county coroner 's office said following an autopsy there were no signs of trauma in jackson 's death , but that additional tests will be needed to determine exactly how the singer died .
" the cause of death has been deferred , " said craig harvey of the coroner 's office .
" the medical examiner has ordered additional testing such as toxicology and other studies . "
harvey said the tests would take four to six weeks to complete .
the outpouring of grief continues following jackson 's death with hundreds of fans joining in a spontaneous moonwalk , jackson 's signature dance move , in london on friday .

harvey said the tests would take four to six weeks to complete .

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .
and , when it was advertised by code in the newspaper - in the frankfurt allgemeine , i think - then the suspicion became firmer .
i found it rather disconcerting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 27.06.2009 african elites ignore poverty exacerbating the continent 's problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeletsi mbeki , the former south african president 's brother , says africa 's elites are damaging the country in his latest book moeletsi mbeki blames african elites for not doing enough against poverty on the continent .
the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

sixteen months ago , the two space agencies announced that after years of over-performance ulysses was finally freezing up and would die in a matter of weeks .
yet somehow the probe kept operating , sending important scientific information about an extraordinarily quiet year for sunspots and solar wind .
but all that really will end after the space agencies announced friday they will finally flick the off switch on ulysses ' transmitter at the end of june , signaling the end of the road for the probe that kept on keeping on .
officials said issues with power , location and antennae made ulysses no longer useful. dfm / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 27.06.2009 african elites ignore poverty exacerbating the continent 's problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeletsi mbeki , the former south african president 's brother , says africa 's elites are damaging the country in his latest book moeletsi mbeki blames african elites for not doing enough against poverty on the continent .
the former south african president tabo mbeki 's younger brother 's tale is one of missed opportunities . moeletsi mbeki 's new book is a blow for the ruling african national congress party , anc , which he once served as an advisor .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , mbeki says that the model of black economic empowerment , as introduced by the anc after the apartheid era in south africa , was never meant to give power to the broad masses .
" black economic empowerment was created by the ultra wealthy white business community in this country , who were involved in mining and financing and other big business .
they used black economic empowerment as a method of countering a programme of nationalisation .
it was a matter of co-option , to co-opt the african nationalist leaders by enriching them privately . "
dominic johnson is a journalist and africa expert with the berlin-based leftist daily tageszeiting .
he also says that poverty in africa is not a matter of economic growth in the first place , but one of sharing .
" economic growth figures are looking good in most parts of africa , but it does n't mean the standard of living is increasing .
a lot of countries are benefiting from prices for raw materials and export goods , but that is n't really dripping down to the general population ; the poverty level is fairly stagnant . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment and poverty are taking an increasing toll on africa 's poor the world bank estimates that the current international recession will lead to an additional 700,000 people dying from poverty and hunger in africa .
the fact that little is undertaken to prevent such a catastrophe is also a matter of accepting a certain type of mentality , johnson says : " inside african countries inequality , which we would consider to be something shocking , is still regarded as something normal and something that you ca n't do anything about .
so the rich do n't see it as their responsibility to help those who do not have these opportunities . "
social welfare for votes in south africa the anc has always identified itself with the poor , seeking to rectify the injustices in employment , land and housing , that stem from apartheid .
consequently it allocates part of the government budget to the very poor , but , says moeletsi mbeki , there are two sides to the coin .
" the other side is making sure that the poor vote for the anc .
so it 's not quite as altruistic as it is presented by the politicians .
it 's a way of buying votes from the poor . "
simultaneously many poor in south africa and elsewhere on the continent want more than social welfare : they want equal opportunities .
mbeki is not surprised that it is taking time .
" the colonialists created an elite , that was very powerful relative to the people .
in our old indigenous structures of power , the poor had a huge amount of power themselves .
so what we need now to look at , is how to increase the power of the poor , so that we have a real countervailing force to limit the power of the elites " mbeki refuses to blame yesterday 's colonialism for today 's poverty in africa .
there are plenty of examples elsewhere in the world , he says , which show that a colonial past is not an obstacle to stamping out poverty , in asia for example .
" what should have been done in africa , is what is being done in india and also china today for example , which is to promote entrepreneurship among the citizens of those countries . "
growing disparity between rich and poor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western multinationals no longer have the same clout in terms of exploitation in africa one reason to stop blaming former colonial powers for not doing enough for africa , mbeki says , is that they simply do n't have the influence they used to have .
during the time of colonialism western multinationals were partners with their governments in exploiting natural resources in africa .
" after the colonial period they lost the political power .
so foreign companies became subordinate to the political elites , that took over power .
many of them were even expropriated , for example union minière of belgium in the congo by mobutu . "
dominic johnson from the tageszeiting in berlin agrees that the time of blaming colonialism has passed : " we now have a new generation in africa , which exercises economical and political control .
and they are not particularly concerned about resolving the social problems around them .
what they do is helping the people they know , but they do n't see themselves as having enough influence to really change society .
that leads to a growing disparity between the world of the rich in africa , which is a globalised world , and the world of the poor , who are basically trying to find a place for themselves . "

german chancellor angela merkel , who met with obama earlier friday at the white house , backed the house bill as " an enormous success , which i would not have thought possible a year ago . "
but the legislation has deeply divided us politicians , businesses and even climate groups .
the outcome of the house vote was uncertain to the very last minute : only eight republicans voted in favor and 43 democrats voted against the measure .
the bill now moves to the senate , which could have an even tougher time getting the measure passed .
groups on both sides have vowed to continue pushing for changes as the legislation makes its way through the us congress .
the united states , which together with china emits about half of the world 's greenhouse gases , has long faced pressure from other governments to more aggressively reduce its carbon footprint .
the mandatory emissions curbs approved friday were long resisted by former president george w. bush .
obama hopes a cap-and-trade system will cut us emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels - about 7 percent below 1990 levels - by 2020 , and nearly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
the obama administration also hopes the bill will bolster the country 's bargaining position at a critical meeting in copenhagen in december , where governments are expected to thrash out a new global treaty to combat climate change. dfm / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the local catholic bishop of regensburg earlier accused the group of defying his authority .
father stefan frey , the head of the seminary , told 1,500 guests who had gathered for the ceremony , that they were being criticized by the german catholic church .
" we deplore the verbal bullying we have been receiving in recent days from several german bishops , " frey said .
but he conceded that the group was still operating in what he called a " grey area " under church law .
swedish , polish and swiss seminarians aged 26 to 30 were declared priests in the saturday ceremony .
the schismatic society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican says the sspx has no status in the church the society of pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- consists of catholics who do not agree with the modern developments in the church that were introduced by the second vatican council , including detente with judaism and a conversion of worship from latin to vernacular languages .
ahead of the ordination , the vatican said that the ordinations would not be permissible under church law .
frey , however , said the vatican had not demanded that the society stop administering catholic sacraments .
the pope has urged the sspx to rejoin the church , but has been assailed by other catholics for allowing the traditionalists to use old , anti-jewish prayers .
the group ordained 13 new priests in winona , minnesota last weekend .
international scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson cast doubt on the number of jews who died in the holocaust the sspx was the subject of controversy last year when one of their bishops , richard williamson , said in an interview that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles , especially after it became known that pope benedict xvi had lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other sspx bishops in an attempt to bring the sect closer to rome .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust at the time , even though critics pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter had existed for some time. av / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case is under investigation .
art expert henrik hanstein tells dw why he 's not surprised . henrik hanstein is managing partner of kunsthaus lempertz in cologne .
founded in 1845 , it is one of the leading art auction houses in europe . deutsche welle : mr. hanstein , in general there are said to be three fake modiglianis around for every real one .
why is it with modigliani paintings particularly difficult to distinguish between an original and a copy ? henrik hanstein : this has to do with modigliani himself , who certainly did n't live the kind of orderly life that every art cataloger hopes for - he did n't register or photograph every painting .
modigliani 's estate was scattered very quickly in all directions and it quickly became a kind of bohemian myth and , thus , an easy target for imitators . to sort this out , five divergent and contradictory catalogues have in the meantime attempted to organize his works .
i do n't know of anything similar in art history .
it 's unique .
and , that makes it really difficult for a museum to put on an exhibition . can anyone say for sure whether the disputed paintings are originals or fakes ? difficult question : at the moment , there are two experts who consider themselves to be the authorities , including professor christian parisot in paris and rome , who received archive documents from modigliani 's daughter and because of that has a kind of competitive advantage .
the second expert also lives in paris .
both have their qualifications , but when i survey the market , both also have large weaknesses . that 's why it 's so difficult to say , ' i know or i do n't ' - that is , unless they have a painting whose provenance they can prove very reliably over many years and have early documents showing its origin . at kunsthaus lempertz , what do you do when you are offered a modigliani ? we recently had an interesting case of a painting that was offered to us from the united states and then lay around for seven years , but none of us liked it , so we did n't want to include it in the auction . what do you mean , you did n't like it ? technically , stylistically , it provenance had n't really been confirmed , it was n't verifiable in any of the catalogues and in such cases you have to be extremely careful . we said we did n't want it , but the collector did n't come to pick it up and also did n't pay the fee for storing it with us , so we gave him a deadline .
it was then promptly picked up by christian parisot , who wanted to examine it carefully in rome .
before we gave it to him , we also brought in a restorer , and , after closer inspection , it became apparent that the signature was on top of the varnish , which is a clear indication of a fake .
also , the canvas was machine-woven and could n't have existed between 1915 and 1917 .
so , on technical grounds , we said , no , that 's not one . but then while in an italian restaurant ordering a pizza i read by chance in the newspaper corriera della sera about a painting that had been missing in private ownership for a long time and then put on display for the first time in italy .
it was billed as a big discovery .
and i could n't believe my eyes .
i looked in my small camera that i had with me . it was " our " painting !
that really took my breath away . so , one has to work almost in a forensic manner .
there 's really no more difficult case than modigliani . there are paintings hanging at the bonn exhibition that are n't from him . that 's not being kept secret .
i do n't think the state attorney 's office would be able to solve it . how should the bonn museum - the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany - react ? it should n't react at all .
the state attorney will ask where is the authoritative expert ? but it wo n't get an answer .
that 's an exhibition that does n't claim to be flawless .
when they go through the exhibition and keep their eyes open , they 'll see that the quality of the paintings varies greatly . but the attempt , after decades , to put together a retrospective , is respectable nevertheless . from the beginning it was clear that , with modigliani , you 'll could run into a trap . it 's been suggested that an allegedly fake painting in the show was put up for sale during the exhibition .
was there an attempt to give the painting a certificate of authenticity during the exhibition ? that was a painting in the exhibition that did n't appeal to me . that applied also to curators .
and , when it was advertised by code in the newspaper - in the frankfurt allgemeine , i think - then the suspicion became firmer .
i found it rather disconcerting .
i do n't know the background .
here , it 's possible that the museum has been used as a means to an end . interview : sabine oelze -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : ian p. johnson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the local catholic bishop of regensburg earlier accused the group of defying his authority .
father stefan frey , the head of the seminary , told 1,500 guests who had gathered for the ceremony , that they were being criticized by the german catholic church .
" we deplore the verbal bullying we have been receiving in recent days from several german bishops , " frey said .
but he conceded that the group was still operating in what he called a " grey area " under church law .
swedish , polish and swiss seminarians aged 26 to 30 were declared priests in the saturday ceremony .
the schismatic society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican says the sspx has no status in the church the society of pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- consists of catholics who do not agree with the modern developments in the church that were introduced by the second vatican council , including detente with judaism and a conversion of worship from latin to vernacular languages .
ahead of the ordination , the vatican said that the ordinations would not be permissible under church law .
frey , however , said the vatican had not demanded that the society stop administering catholic sacraments .
the pope has urged the sspx to rejoin the church , but has been assailed by other catholics for allowing the traditionalists to use old , anti-jewish prayers .
the group ordained 13 new priests in winona , minnesota last weekend .
international scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson cast doubt on the number of jews who died in the holocaust the sspx was the subject of controversy last year when one of their bishops , richard williamson , said in an interview that he believed there were no gas chambers and that no more than 300,000 jews perished in nazi concentration camps , rather than the 6 million accepted by most historians .
williamson 's comments stirred anger in jewish communities throughout the world , as well as in catholic circles , especially after it became known that pope benedict xvi had lifted the excommunication of richard williamson and three other sspx bishops in an attempt to bring the sect closer to rome .
the vatican said it was not aware of williamson 's views on the holocaust at the time , even though critics pointed out that internet-based material written by williamson on the matter had existed for some time. av / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel , who met with obama earlier friday at the white house , backed the house bill as " an enormous success , which i would not have thought possible a year ago . "
but the legislation has deeply divided us politicians , businesses and even climate groups .
the outcome of the house vote was uncertain to the very last minute : only eight republicans voted in favor and 43 democrats voted against the measure .
the bill now moves to the senate , which could have an even tougher time getting the measure passed .
groups on both sides have vowed to continue pushing for changes as the legislation makes its way through the us congress .
the united states , which together with china emits about half of the world 's greenhouse gases , has long faced pressure from other governments to more aggressively reduce its carbon footprint .
the mandatory emissions curbs approved friday were long resisted by former president george w. bush .
obama hopes a cap-and-trade system will cut us emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels - about 7 percent below 1990 levels - by 2020 , and nearly 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050 .
the obama administration also hopes the bill will bolster the country 's bargaining position at a critical meeting in copenhagen in december , where governments are expected to thrash out a new global treaty to combat climate change. dfm / dpa / afp editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
