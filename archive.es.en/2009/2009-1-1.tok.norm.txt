despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .
“ for some young people that 's exciting , “ broden said .
the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .
violent attacks were up , as were incidents of anti-semitism .

a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .

the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .

the small town is using the opportunity to face up to its past as nazi dictator adolf hitler 's favorite city . some european capitals of culture are luckier than others .
while this year liverpool banked on the beatles , the austrian town of linz has to grapple with its connection to adolf hitler in 2009 . but besides using the opportunity to deal with the fact that hitler planned to make linz a major cultural center of the third reich , the steel town along the danube river will offer a host of quirky cultural projects geared towards a wide public rather than a select few . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linz is taking an irreverent approach to the cultural capital concept " linz is an unknown creature even for austrians , " mayor franz dobusch said of this town which was first mentioned as a medieval trading hub in 799 , but which remained a small provincial center until the 20th century . while few austrians know about the medieval alleys of the historical center , most associate linz with voestalpine ag , the steel producer that was founded as part of nazi germany 's industrial complex in 1938 , after austria was annexed by the german reich . hitler 's cultural capital in the exhibition " the cultural capital of the fuehrer , " which runs until march , visitors travelling some 190 kilometers west of vienna to linz have a chance to examine hitler 's grandiose plans to make the town into a cultural center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his love for linz , hitler had no problem setting up the infamous mauthausen death camp nearby hitler spent some of his childhood and youth in linz .
his plans to build grand boulevards and the world 's largest art gallery were never realized . but the european capital of culture also invites locals and tourists to explore national socialist remnants throughout town .
armed with an audio guide , one can listen to survivors while being led through a residential area and a former underground aircraft factory that were part of the gusen concentration camp . " whenever you come to linz in the coming year , you will find something related to this topic , " said ulrich fuchs , the deputy manager of the 2009 events . home visits when linz took over as cultural capital on new year 's eve , along with lithuania 's capital vilnius , the opening event signaled that the working-class town wanted to offer projects that appeal to visitors and the local public alike . on dec .
31 , official guests were not treated to a formal dinner , but were rather invited into the homes of locals , including families , university students and gay couples . " of course we see to it that we do n't send the israeli ambassador to a palestinian family , of all places , " fuchs said . unusual projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new ars electronica building besides the annual ars electronica festival of media and electronic art , and an exhibition called " best of austria " , featuring works from the country 's most famous museums , there are few traditional cultural events , but a host of unusual projects . in may , a group of artists organizes " surveillance-free tours " , for which participants don camouflage gear and sneak and crawl their way to tourist sites , evading the gaze of security cameras . at a festival in november , linz will host a number of international puppet theater players with productions geared towards adults , such as a production by neville tranter , who will present the traditional irreverent puppet character punch as a bomb-planting terrorist . unusual accommodation those wishing to combine unusual cultural experiences with unusual accommodation can check in at the pixel hotel , which is not really a hotel but rather a number of rooms installed all over linz , including in a former cabinet maker 's workshop , a former soup kitchen , and a ship in the danube harbor . as the mayor of a provincial town , mayor dobusch is realistic about his goals for 2009 . " we want to attract people in a 300-kilometer radius " , he said , referring to an area including parts of germany , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia and northern italy .

it looks to be a tough tenure as the eu struggles to deal with renewed conflict in the mideast and faces its worst economic crisis in decades . on jan .
1 , the czech republic takes charge of the european union in the midst of global tension over the middle east and european worries over a gas dispute with russia .
the former communist country , which joined the eu only four years ago , has been working hard to prepare for its six months in the spotlight .
in recent weeks , czech officials have been brushing aside concerns that they are not ready for the responsibility of leading the 27-nation bloc .
hard act to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is an outspoken critic of europe skeptics have pointed out that europe is in the midst of a financial crisis , which requires a united european response .
it 's hard for many to imagine that kind of leadership coming from czech president vaclav klaus , a euro skeptic who continuously criticizes most things european in his speeches and statements .
many analysts also point to the fact that prime minister mirek topolanek 's minority government has dragged its feet on the lisbon reform treaty , a charter intended to streamline eu decision making .
the czech republic is one of just three eu members who have yet to ratify the treaty .
it also wo n't be easy for the czech republic to take over the reigns from france .
french president nicolas sarkozy was seen as running an extremely successful agenda-setting presidency up to the very end when he spearheaded diplomatic efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in the middle east .
priorities are set the czech delegation has tried to quell worries over their ability to lead the eu , identifying three main priorities : energy security , external relations and the economy , said czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra " we will be glad if we manage to complete two specific things , " vondra said , alluding to energy security issues and the eu 's eastern partnership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european energy security will be a top agenda item one of the first issues will undoubtedly be the ongoing disagreement between ukraine and russia over gas supplies .
after failing to negotiate an agreement over gas payments for 2009 , russia announced it would cut off gas supplies to ukraine starting jan .
1 .
a cut in deliveries could be felt in europe , which gets most of its russian gas via ukraine .
past disputes between the two countries have lead to reductions in delivery .
eu foreign ministers will gather in prague on jan .
8 , with energy security expected to be a top agenda item .
middle east relations top foreign policy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in the middle east continues to concern europe topping the foreign policy agenda at the start of the year are european efforts to negotiate in the escalating mideast conflict .
on sunday foreign minister karel schwarzenberg is expected to travel to the middle east to work towards a ceasefire in the gaza strip , where israel has killed nearly 400 people in an offensive it says is intended to stop rocket attacks from hamas .
" as soon as he -lrb- schwarzenberg -rrb- takes over the presidency , he feels it is his duty to fly there and start handling it , " a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said .
schwarzenberg , a close ally of washington and pro-israel , defended the strikes .
he put the onus of the latest conflict on hamas and said israel had the right to defend itself .
his position differs sharply from sarkozy 's condemnation of aggression from both sides and calls for an immediate ceasefire .
focus on the economy although the ex-communist state of 10 million people has suffered less than most of the rest of the bloc from plummeting markets , bank bailouts and job losses , the czech republic will have to steer the eu through what is becoming the worst economic crisis in decades .
it wo n't be an easy course , as prague leaders have derided other eu governments for ramping up state spending with stimulus packages to counter falling private sector growth .
the czechs for their part expect slight growth next year and see unemployment rising to just around 6 percent .
such a posturing will put them at odds with big euro zone countries that are already fighting recession , or spain where some economists say unemployment could hit 20 percent . dw staff -lrb- th , ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our customers can count on reliable deliveries , " said martin weyand , chief of the bdew german utilities federation . he said germany did not rely only on pipelines through ukraine to receive russian natural gas , but also on transit via belarus .
in addition , norway , britain and the netherlands supply germany with gas from offshore fields .
he also said germany held large gas stocks . kiev urges eu mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas monopoly gazprom wants ukraine to pay more for its gas a joint statement signed by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko made public early thursday morning said their country had asked the eu to mediate the dispute with russia , and promised supplies to europe would continue " uninterrupted . " a spokesman for gazprom said it had cut 100 percent of supplies , or 110 million cubic meters of gas per day , meant for ukraine from 10 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- after last-ditch talks new year 's eve on a new deal for gas deliveries failed . " at the current time we have no contract for the deliveries of gas to ukraine , " sergei kupriyanov said in a televised press conference . supplies to european customers further downstream have been increased to 326 million cubic meters per day , he added . ukraine 's gas monopoly naftogaz confirmed it was observing a steady drop in gas pressure , and said it was tapping its gas reserves to make up for the difference , both to domestic and downstream customers . eu reluctant to get involved the eu , however , seemed hesitant about getting involved . speaking on czech television , the new eu head , czech prime minister mirek topolanek , said that the eu was reluctant to broker the bilateral gas dispute . " it is pretty much a russian-ukrainian dispute and it has to be solved as such , " topolanek said . " we will appeal on both parties to reach an agreement as it is not advisable to get involved in the conflict because no one is fully familiar with those contracts , " he said . limited reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu comes from russia limited reserves and a need to protect domestic consumers have forced ukraine to reduce flow to europe by a net 21 million cubic meters per day , said oleh dubina , chairman of the ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftohaz ukrainy . overall supplies to europe from russia on thursday were for practical purposes at normal levels , with a relatively small reduction in flow from ukraine cancelled by an increased flow through belarus . gas supply within ukraine was normal as well , according to eyewitness reports . the breakdown in talks between moscow and kiev has raised fears of a repeat of 2006 , when a similar cutoff caused gas shortages and price spikes in western europe .
gazprom blamed ukrainian siphoning off of gas at the time . tymoshenko reassured eu commission president jose manuel barroso on wednesday that gas transit would continue uninterrupted , but gazprom accused naftogaz of " blackmailing " it with threats in talks to seize transits to europe . over 80 percent of russian gas exports to europe pass through ukrainian pipelines . tough negotiations negotiating positions between the two countries on a new gas contract were still far apart on wednesday evening .
ukraine rejected a russian offer for deliveries at $ 250 -lrb- 179 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters without a change to gas shipment tariffs charged by ukraine for on-shipment to europe . the yushchenko-tymoshenko statement , however , said ukraine could accept a maximum price of $ 201 dollars for russian gas and a minimum 15-percent hike in transit fees . russian prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday called russia 's position " very favorable " for ukraine , and declared the 250 dollar rate the kremlin 's final offer . naftogaz and gazprom officials on thursday traded accusations of breaking off talks , blaming their opposites for the wednesday end to negotiations .
both companies issued statements declaring themselves ready to re-start discussions . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as violence in the gaza strip moved into the sixth day , international appeals for a un-backed ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants failed to produce a result . a united nations security council debate on israel 's air offensive on the gaza strip has ended without a vote on a draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
diplomats said negotiations would be held in the next few days to try to reach an agreed text . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency meeting of arab league in cairo , dec .

western delegates described the resolution , which was presented by libya and egypt , as unbalanced in its current form .
the us and uk criticized the draft for calling on israel to end its air assaults while making no mention of hamas rocket attacks against israel , which they say started the latest hostilities . the un debate came just hours after the arab league called on the security council to pass a resolution demanding that israel stop its attacks . following an arab league meeting in cairo on dec .
31 , saudi foreign minister saud al-faisal told reporters the ministers had strongly condemned what they described as barbaric aggression on the part of israel . on sunday , the security council already called for an immediate end to all violence in gaza , but this was dismissed by israel . israel rejects temporary truce israel also rejected on wednesday a european union proposal for a 48-hour truce to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered to the palestinian territory 's 1.5 million residents , saying the time was not yet ripe to call a halt to the air raids that so far have killed some 390 people . prime minister ehud olmert said israel " did not launch the gaza offensive only to end it while the rocket fire remains unchanged . " he said that " if the right conditions - the kind we feel would guarantee better security realities in the south - will present themselves , we would be willing to consider it , but we 're not there yet . " bildunterschrift : smoke rises from israeli missile strikes in the northern gaza strip hamas prepared to continue fight hamas vowed on wednesday to remain defiant if israel makes good on threats to send ground troops into gaza after rejecting calls for a truce . " we in hamas are ready for all scenarios and we will fight until the last breath , " senior official mushir al-masri told afp as israeli media speculated that a ground offensive was imminent . " israel will embark on a veritable adventure if it decides to invade gaza , " he said . in a defiant televised speech , the head of the hamas government , ismail haniya , vowed israel would be defeated .
" our people will defeat those tanks that await orders to perpetrate more massacres , " he said and called for an unconditional end to israeli aggression and blockade of the palestinian territory . " if the aggression is halted unconditionally and the blockade is lifted and the passages are opened , we can discuss all issues in a positive manner , " haniya said . diplomatic efforts continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 500 palestinians living in the gaza strip have fled into egypt despite the failure of ceasefire proposals and un resolutions , european leaders continue to apply diplomatic pressure to bring an end to the fighting .

israel argued that it is the victim of terrorist attacks . also during the visit to france , livni told french foreign minister bernard kouchner that there was no need for a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons as there is no humanitarian crisis in the gaza strip . after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , livni told reporters that israel is bringing about change in the gaza strip by attacking militants and providing support to centrists . she added that sarkozy understood the situation . germany asks israel to consider arab proposals german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed on thursday to israel to respond " constructively " to arab league efforts for a halt in the fighting in the gaza strip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have caused considerable damage in gaza he telephoned israeli foreign minister tzipi livni to voice " his great concern about the continuation of the fighting , " his office said in berlin . he told her the fighting endangered progress to date in the middle east peace process and undermined the stance of those arabs who were willing to engage with israel . but he also said the pre-condition for a truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas authorities in the gaza strip . a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel meanwhile rejected criticism of her forthright support for israel during the conflict with hamas . merkel 's assessment , offered during her new year address , matched that of the european union foreign ministers , the spokesman said . she had made it clear that she too desired a truce in the fighting as soon as possible , he added . " however conditions have to be met , and the most important condition in the view of the chancellor is that israel 's security must be secured , " said the spokesman at her office . senior hamas leader killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians protested the killing of nizar rayan and his family earlier on thursday , an israeli airstrike killed a senior hamas leader , his wife and eight children . nizar rayan and his family were killed when his house was struck in the northern gaza refugee camp of jabaliya , kamal odwan hospital in the refugee camp confirmed .
rayan was the most senior hamas leader killed so far in six days of ferocious israeli airstrikes .
most top leaders of the movement have gone into hiding .
rayan , in his 50s , was a senior political leader of hamas in the north of the strip , but also close to the movement 's armed wing , the al-qassam brigades .
he led the al-qassam brigades and the palestinian resistance during several israeli military ground incursions into the strip in the past .
an israeli military spokeswoman could not immediately confirm he was the target of the strike , but said the israel air force had hit several buildings in jabaliya used by hamas for storing rockets .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international pressure to end six days of violence showed little immediate effect on thursday morning , an israeli military spokesman said that the air force and navy had carried out around 20 operations since midnight , hitting , among other targets , the palestinian legislative council building , the hamas-run ministry of justice , tunnels running under the gaza-egyptian border , and a hamas arms depot .
militants fired around five missiles and mortars thursday morning , including grad missiles which struck the israeli city of beersheba .
there were no reports of injuries .
israeli army ground troops from the engineering and armoured corps , meanwhile , were massing on the israel-gaza border , waiting for the order to enter the enclave .
israel radio quoted a military official as saying that the ground operation , which is believed imminent , would involve many soldiers , but would be limited in scope .

the small town is using the opportunity to face up to its past as nazi dictator adolf hitler 's favorite city . some european capitals of culture are luckier than others .
while this year liverpool banked on the beatles , the austrian town of linz has to grapple with its connection to adolf hitler in 2009 . but besides using the opportunity to deal with the fact that hitler planned to make linz a major cultural center of the third reich , the steel town along the danube river will offer a host of quirky cultural projects geared towards a wide public rather than a select few . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linz is taking an irreverent approach to the cultural capital concept " linz is an unknown creature even for austrians , " mayor franz dobusch said of this town which was first mentioned as a medieval trading hub in 799 , but which remained a small provincial center until the 20th century . while few austrians know about the medieval alleys of the historical center , most associate linz with voestalpine ag , the steel producer that was founded as part of nazi germany 's industrial complex in 1938 , after austria was annexed by the german reich . hitler 's cultural capital in the exhibition " the cultural capital of the fuehrer , " which runs until march , visitors travelling some 190 kilometers west of vienna to linz have a chance to examine hitler 's grandiose plans to make the town into a cultural center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his love for linz , hitler had no problem setting up the infamous mauthausen death camp nearby hitler spent some of his childhood and youth in linz .
his plans to build grand boulevards and the world 's largest art gallery were never realized . but the european capital of culture also invites locals and tourists to explore national socialist remnants throughout town .
armed with an audio guide , one can listen to survivors while being led through a residential area and a former underground aircraft factory that were part of the gusen concentration camp .

" our customers can count on reliable deliveries , " said martin weyand , chief of the bdew german utilities federation . he said germany did not rely only on pipelines through ukraine to receive russian natural gas , but also on transit via belarus .
in addition , norway , britain and the netherlands supply germany with gas from offshore fields .
he also said germany held large gas stocks . kiev urges eu mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas monopoly gazprom wants ukraine to pay more for its gas a joint statement signed by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko made public early thursday morning said their country had asked the eu to mediate the dispute with russia , and promised supplies to europe would continue " uninterrupted . " a spokesman for gazprom said it had cut 100 percent of supplies , or 110 million cubic meters of gas per day , meant for ukraine from 10 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- after last-ditch talks new year 's eve on a new deal for gas deliveries failed . " at the current time we have no contract for the deliveries of gas to ukraine , " sergei kupriyanov said in a televised press conference . supplies to european customers further downstream have been increased to 326 million cubic meters per day , he added . ukraine 's gas monopoly naftogaz confirmed it was observing a steady drop in gas pressure , and said it was tapping its gas reserves to make up for the difference , both to domestic and downstream customers . eu reluctant to get involved the eu , however , seemed hesitant about getting involved . speaking on czech television , the new eu head , czech prime minister mirek topolanek , said that the eu was reluctant to broker the bilateral gas dispute . " it is pretty much a russian-ukrainian dispute and it has to be solved as such , " topolanek said . " we will appeal on both parties to reach an agreement as it is not advisable to get involved in the conflict because no one is fully familiar with those contracts , " he said . limited reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu comes from russia limited reserves and a need to protect domestic consumers have forced ukraine to reduce flow to europe by a net 21 million cubic meters per day , said oleh dubina , chairman of the ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftohaz ukrainy . overall supplies to europe from russia on thursday were for practical purposes at normal levels , with a relatively small reduction in flow from ukraine cancelled by an increased flow through belarus . gas supply within ukraine was normal as well , according to eyewitness reports . the breakdown in talks between moscow and kiev has raised fears of a repeat of 2006 , when a similar cutoff caused gas shortages and price spikes in western europe .
gazprom blamed ukrainian siphoning off of gas at the time . tymoshenko reassured eu commission president jose manuel barroso on wednesday that gas transit would continue uninterrupted , but gazprom accused naftogaz of " blackmailing " it with threats in talks to seize transits to europe . over 80 percent of russian gas exports to europe pass through ukrainian pipelines . tough negotiations negotiating positions between the two countries on a new gas contract were still far apart on wednesday evening .
ukraine rejected a russian offer for deliveries at $ 250 -lrb- 179 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters without a change to gas shipment tariffs charged by ukraine for on-shipment to europe . the yushchenko-tymoshenko statement , however , said ukraine could accept a maximum price of $ 201 dollars for russian gas and a minimum 15-percent hike in transit fees . russian prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday called russia 's position " very favorable " for ukraine , and declared the 250 dollar rate the kremlin 's final offer . naftogaz and gazprom officials on thursday traded accusations of breaking off talks , blaming their opposites for the wednesday end to negotiations .
both companies issued statements declaring themselves ready to re-start discussions . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our customers can count on reliable deliveries , " said martin weyand , chief of the bdew german utilities federation . he said germany did not rely only on pipelines through ukraine to receive russian natural gas , but also on transit via belarus .
in addition , norway , britain and the netherlands supply germany with gas from offshore fields .
he also said germany held large gas stocks . kiev urges eu mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas monopoly gazprom wants ukraine to pay more for its gas a joint statement signed by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko made public early thursday morning said their country had asked the eu to mediate the dispute with russia , and promised supplies to europe would continue " uninterrupted . " a spokesman for gazprom said it had cut 100 percent of supplies , or 110 million cubic meters of gas per day , meant for ukraine from 10 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- after last-ditch talks new year 's eve on a new deal for gas deliveries failed . " at the current time we have no contract for the deliveries of gas to ukraine , " sergei kupriyanov said in a televised press conference . supplies to european customers further downstream have been increased to 326 million cubic meters per day , he added . ukraine 's gas monopoly naftogaz confirmed it was observing a steady drop in gas pressure , and said it was tapping its gas reserves to make up for the difference , both to domestic and downstream customers . eu reluctant to get involved the eu , however , seemed hesitant about getting involved . speaking on czech television , the new eu head , czech prime minister mirek topolanek , said that the eu was reluctant to broker the bilateral gas dispute . " it is pretty much a russian-ukrainian dispute and it has to be solved as such , " topolanek said . " we will appeal on both parties to reach an agreement as it is not advisable to get involved in the conflict because no one is fully familiar with those contracts , " he said . limited reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu comes from russia limited reserves and a need to protect domestic consumers have forced ukraine to reduce flow to europe by a net 21 million cubic meters per day , said oleh dubina , chairman of the ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftohaz ukrainy . overall supplies to europe from russia on thursday were for practical purposes at normal levels , with a relatively small reduction in flow from ukraine cancelled by an increased flow through belarus . gas supply within ukraine was normal as well , according to eyewitness reports . the breakdown in talks between moscow and kiev has raised fears of a repeat of 2006 , when a similar cutoff caused gas shortages and price spikes in western europe .
gazprom blamed ukrainian siphoning off of gas at the time . tymoshenko reassured eu commission president jose manuel barroso on wednesday that gas transit would continue uninterrupted , but gazprom accused naftogaz of " blackmailing " it with threats in talks to seize transits to europe . over 80 percent of russian gas exports to europe pass through ukrainian pipelines . tough negotiations negotiating positions between the two countries on a new gas contract were still far apart on wednesday evening .
ukraine rejected a russian offer for deliveries at $ 250 -lrb- 179 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters without a change to gas shipment tariffs charged by ukraine for on-shipment to europe . the yushchenko-tymoshenko statement , however , said ukraine could accept a maximum price of $ 201 dollars for russian gas and a minimum 15-percent hike in transit fees . russian prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday called russia 's position " very favorable " for ukraine , and declared the 250 dollar rate the kremlin 's final offer . naftogaz and gazprom officials on thursday traded accusations of breaking off talks , blaming their opposites for the wednesday end to negotiations .
both companies issued statements declaring themselves ready to re-start discussions . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" of course we see to it that we do n't send the israeli ambassador to a palestinian family , of all places , " fuchs said . unusual projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new ars electronica building besides the annual ars electronica festival of media and electronic art , and an exhibition called " best of austria " , featuring works from the country 's most famous museums , there are few traditional cultural events , but a host of unusual projects . in may , a group of artists organizes " surveillance-free tours " , for which participants don camouflage gear and sneak and crawl their way to tourist sites , evading the gaze of security cameras . at a festival in november , linz will host a number of international puppet theater players with productions geared towards adults , such as a production by neville tranter , who will present the traditional irreverent puppet character punch as a bomb-planting terrorist . unusual accommodation those wishing to combine unusual cultural experiences with unusual accommodation can check in at the pixel hotel , which is not really a hotel but rather a number of rooms installed all over linz , including in a former cabinet maker 's workshop , a former soup kitchen , and a ship in the danube harbor . as the mayor of a provincial town , mayor dobusch is realistic about his goals for 2009 . " we want to attract people in a 300-kilometer radius " , he said , referring to an area including parts of germany , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia and northern italy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.01.2009 czech republic takes over eu chair amid crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague celebrates the start of what could be a difficult eu presidency for the next six months , prague will set the agenda for the european union .
it looks to be a tough tenure as the eu struggles to deal with renewed conflict in the mideast and faces its worst economic crisis in decades . on jan .
1 , the czech republic takes charge of the european union in the midst of global tension over the middle east and european worries over a gas dispute with russia .
the former communist country , which joined the eu only four years ago , has been working hard to prepare for its six months in the spotlight .
in recent weeks , czech officials have been brushing aside concerns that they are not ready for the responsibility of leading the 27-nation bloc .
hard act to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is an outspoken critic of europe skeptics have pointed out that europe is in the midst of a financial crisis , which requires a united european response .
it 's hard for many to imagine that kind of leadership coming from czech president vaclav klaus , a euro skeptic who continuously criticizes most things european in his speeches and statements .
many analysts also point to the fact that prime minister mirek topolanek 's minority government has dragged its feet on the lisbon reform treaty , a charter intended to streamline eu decision making .
the czech republic is one of just three eu members who have yet to ratify the treaty .
it also wo n't be easy for the czech republic to take over the reigns from france .
french president nicolas sarkozy was seen as running an extremely successful agenda-setting presidency up to the very end when he spearheaded diplomatic efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in the middle east .
priorities are set the czech delegation has tried to quell worries over their ability to lead the eu , identifying three main priorities : energy security , external relations and the economy , said czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra " we will be glad if we manage to complete two specific things , " vondra said , alluding to energy security issues and the eu 's eastern partnership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european energy security will be a top agenda item one of the first issues will undoubtedly be the ongoing disagreement between ukraine and russia over gas supplies .
after failing to negotiate an agreement over gas payments for 2009 , russia announced it would cut off gas supplies to ukraine starting jan .
1 .
a cut in deliveries could be felt in europe , which gets most of its russian gas via ukraine .
past disputes between the two countries have lead to reductions in delivery .
eu foreign ministers will gather in prague on jan .
8 , with energy security expected to be a top agenda item .
middle east relations top foreign policy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in the middle east continues to concern europe topping the foreign policy agenda at the start of the year are european efforts to negotiate in the escalating mideast conflict .
on sunday foreign minister karel schwarzenberg is expected to travel to the middle east to work towards a ceasefire in the gaza strip , where israel has killed nearly 400 people in an offensive it says is intended to stop rocket attacks from hamas .
" as soon as he -lrb- schwarzenberg -rrb- takes over the presidency , he feels it is his duty to fly there and start handling it , " a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said .
schwarzenberg , a close ally of washington and pro-israel , defended the strikes .
he put the onus of the latest conflict on hamas and said israel had the right to defend itself .
his position differs sharply from sarkozy 's condemnation of aggression from both sides and calls for an immediate ceasefire .
focus on the economy although the ex-communist state of 10 million people has suffered less than most of the rest of the bloc from plummeting markets , bank bailouts and job losses , the czech republic will have to steer the eu through what is becoming the worst economic crisis in decades .
it wo n't be an easy course , as prague leaders have derided other eu governments for ramping up state spending with stimulus packages to counter falling private sector growth .
the czechs for their part expect slight growth next year and see unemployment rising to just around 6 percent .
such a posturing will put them at odds with big euro zone countries that are already fighting recession , or spain where some economists say unemployment could hit 20 percent . dw staff -lrb- th , ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel argued that it is the victim of terrorist attacks . also during the visit to france , livni told french foreign minister bernard kouchner that there was no need for a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons as there is no humanitarian crisis in the gaza strip . after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , livni told reporters that israel is bringing about change in the gaza strip by attacking militants and providing support to centrists . she added that sarkozy understood the situation . germany asks israel to consider arab proposals german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed on thursday to israel to respond " constructively " to arab league efforts for a halt in the fighting in the gaza strip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have caused considerable damage in gaza he telephoned israeli foreign minister tzipi livni to voice " his great concern about the continuation of the fighting , " his office said in berlin . he told her the fighting endangered progress to date in the middle east peace process and undermined the stance of those arabs who were willing to engage with israel . but he also said the pre-condition for a truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas authorities in the gaza strip . a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel meanwhile rejected criticism of her forthright support for israel during the conflict with hamas . merkel 's assessment , offered during her new year address , matched that of the european union foreign ministers , the spokesman said . she had made it clear that she too desired a truce in the fighting as soon as possible , he added . " however conditions have to be met , and the most important condition in the view of the chancellor is that israel 's security must be secured , " said the spokesman at her office . senior hamas leader killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians protested the killing of nizar rayan and his family earlier on thursday , an israeli airstrike killed a senior hamas leader , his wife and eight children . nizar rayan and his family were killed when his house was struck in the northern gaza refugee camp of jabaliya , kamal odwan hospital in the refugee camp confirmed .
rayan was the most senior hamas leader killed so far in six days of ferocious israeli airstrikes .
most top leaders of the movement have gone into hiding .
rayan , in his 50s , was a senior political leader of hamas in the north of the strip , but also close to the movement 's armed wing , the al-qassam brigades .
he led the al-qassam brigades and the palestinian resistance during several israeli military ground incursions into the strip in the past .
an israeli military spokeswoman could not immediately confirm he was the target of the strike , but said the israel air force had hit several buildings in jabaliya used by hamas for storing rockets .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international pressure to end six days of violence showed little immediate effect on thursday morning , an israeli military spokesman said that the air force and navy had carried out around 20 operations since midnight , hitting , among other targets , the palestinian legislative council building , the hamas-run ministry of justice , tunnels running under the gaza-egyptian border , and a hamas arms depot .
militants fired around five missiles and mortars thursday morning , including grad missiles which struck the israeli city of beersheba .
there were no reports of injuries .
israeli army ground troops from the engineering and armoured corps , meanwhile , were massing on the israel-gaza border , waiting for the order to enter the enclave .
israel radio quoted a military official as saying that the ground operation , which is believed imminent , would involve many soldiers , but would be limited in scope .
israel 's " iron fist " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 400 gazans have been killed and some 1,700 have been wounded since israel embarked on its aerial campaign meanwhile , israel 's caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said on thursday that his country would continue to act against hamas with an " iron fist . "
touring the southern israeli desert city of beersheba , hit for the first time ever by hamas ' imported grad rockets on tuesday , he added however he hoped israel would be able to complete its now six-day-old offensive in gaza and achieve its goals " as quickly as possible . "
the israeli military had earlier said the offensive would " take time . "
" we have n't declared a war on the residents of gaza , " olmert said according to a government statement .
" i 've said it before and i say it again that we will deal with the residents with silk gloves , but with hamas with an iron fist . "

a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .
“ for some young people that 's exciting , “ broden said .
the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .

a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .

these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel argued that it is the victim of terrorist attacks . also during the visit to france , livni told french foreign minister bernard kouchner that there was no need for a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons as there is no humanitarian crisis in the gaza strip . after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , livni told reporters that israel is bringing about change in the gaza strip by attacking militants and providing support to centrists . she added that sarkozy understood the situation . germany asks israel to consider arab proposals german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed on thursday to israel to respond " constructively " to arab league efforts for a halt in the fighting in the gaza strip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have caused considerable damage in gaza he telephoned israeli foreign minister tzipi livni to voice " his great concern about the continuation of the fighting , " his office said in berlin . he told her the fighting endangered progress to date in the middle east peace process and undermined the stance of those arabs who were willing to engage with israel . but he also said the pre-condition for a truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas authorities in the gaza strip . a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel meanwhile rejected criticism of her forthright support for israel during the conflict with hamas . merkel 's assessment , offered during her new year address , matched that of the european union foreign ministers , the spokesman said . she had made it clear that she too desired a truce in the fighting as soon as possible , he added . " however conditions have to be met , and the most important condition in the view of the chancellor is that israel 's security must be secured , " said the spokesman at her office . senior hamas leader killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians protested the killing of nizar rayan and his family earlier on thursday , an israeli airstrike killed a senior hamas leader , his wife and eight children . nizar rayan and his family were killed when his house was struck in the northern gaza refugee camp of jabaliya , kamal odwan hospital in the refugee camp confirmed .
rayan was the most senior hamas leader killed so far in six days of ferocious israeli airstrikes .
most top leaders of the movement have gone into hiding .
rayan , in his 50s , was a senior political leader of hamas in the north of the strip , but also close to the movement 's armed wing , the al-qassam brigades .
he led the al-qassam brigades and the palestinian resistance during several israeli military ground incursions into the strip in the past .
an israeli military spokeswoman could not immediately confirm he was the target of the strike , but said the israel air force had hit several buildings in jabaliya used by hamas for storing rockets .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international pressure to end six days of violence showed little immediate effect on thursday morning , an israeli military spokesman said that the air force and navy had carried out around 20 operations since midnight , hitting , among other targets , the palestinian legislative council building , the hamas-run ministry of justice , tunnels running under the gaza-egyptian border , and a hamas arms depot .
militants fired around five missiles and mortars thursday morning , including grad missiles which struck the israeli city of beersheba .
there were no reports of injuries .
israeli army ground troops from the engineering and armoured corps , meanwhile , were massing on the israel-gaza border , waiting for the order to enter the enclave .
israel radio quoted a military official as saying that the ground operation , which is believed imminent , would involve many soldiers , but would be limited in scope .
israel 's " iron fist " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 400 gazans have been killed and some 1,700 have been wounded since israel embarked on its aerial campaign meanwhile , israel 's caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said on thursday that his country would continue to act against hamas with an " iron fist . "
touring the southern israeli desert city of beersheba , hit for the first time ever by hamas ' imported grad rockets on tuesday , he added however he hoped israel would be able to complete its now six-day-old offensive in gaza and achieve its goals " as quickly as possible . "
the israeli military had earlier said the offensive would " take time . "
" we have n't declared a war on the residents of gaza , " olmert said according to a government statement .

israel argued that it is the victim of terrorist attacks . also during the visit to france , livni told french foreign minister bernard kouchner that there was no need for a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons as there is no humanitarian crisis in the gaza strip . after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , livni told reporters that israel is bringing about change in the gaza strip by attacking militants and providing support to centrists . she added that sarkozy understood the situation . germany asks israel to consider arab proposals german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed on thursday to israel to respond " constructively " to arab league efforts for a halt in the fighting in the gaza strip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have caused considerable damage in gaza he telephoned israeli foreign minister tzipi livni to voice " his great concern about the continuation of the fighting , " his office said in berlin . he told her the fighting endangered progress to date in the middle east peace process and undermined the stance of those arabs who were willing to engage with israel . but he also said the pre-condition for a truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas authorities in the gaza strip . a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel meanwhile rejected criticism of her forthright support for israel during the conflict with hamas . merkel 's assessment , offered during her new year address , matched that of the european union foreign ministers , the spokesman said . she had made it clear that she too desired a truce in the fighting as soon as possible , he added . " however conditions have to be met , and the most important condition in the view of the chancellor is that israel 's security must be secured , " said the spokesman at her office . senior hamas leader killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians protested the killing of nizar rayan and his family earlier on thursday , an israeli airstrike killed a senior hamas leader , his wife and eight children . nizar rayan and his family were killed when his house was struck in the northern gaza refugee camp of jabaliya , kamal odwan hospital in the refugee camp confirmed .
rayan was the most senior hamas leader killed so far in six days of ferocious israeli airstrikes .
most top leaders of the movement have gone into hiding .
rayan , in his 50s , was a senior political leader of hamas in the north of the strip , but also close to the movement 's armed wing , the al-qassam brigades .
he led the al-qassam brigades and the palestinian resistance during several israeli military ground incursions into the strip in the past .
an israeli military spokeswoman could not immediately confirm he was the target of the strike , but said the israel air force had hit several buildings in jabaliya used by hamas for storing rockets .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international pressure to end six days of violence showed little immediate effect on thursday morning , an israeli military spokesman said that the air force and navy had carried out around 20 operations since midnight , hitting , among other targets , the palestinian legislative council building , the hamas-run ministry of justice , tunnels running under the gaza-egyptian border , and a hamas arms depot .
militants fired around five missiles and mortars thursday morning , including grad missiles which struck the israeli city of beersheba .
there were no reports of injuries .
israeli army ground troops from the engineering and armoured corps , meanwhile , were massing on the israel-gaza border , waiting for the order to enter the enclave .
israel radio quoted a military official as saying that the ground operation , which is believed imminent , would involve many soldiers , but would be limited in scope .
israel 's " iron fist " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 400 gazans have been killed and some 1,700 have been wounded since israel embarked on its aerial campaign meanwhile , israel 's caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said on thursday that his country would continue to act against hamas with an " iron fist . "
touring the southern israeli desert city of beersheba , hit for the first time ever by hamas ' imported grad rockets on tuesday , he added however he hoped israel would be able to complete its now six-day-old offensive in gaza and achieve its goals " as quickly as possible . "
the israeli military had earlier said the offensive would " take time . "
" we have n't declared a war on the residents of gaza , " olmert said according to a government statement .
" i 've said it before and i say it again that we will deal with the residents with silk gloves , but with hamas with an iron fist . "

" our customers can count on reliable deliveries , " said martin weyand , chief of the bdew german utilities federation . he said germany did not rely only on pipelines through ukraine to receive russian natural gas , but also on transit via belarus .
in addition , norway , britain and the netherlands supply germany with gas from offshore fields .
he also said germany held large gas stocks . kiev urges eu mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas monopoly gazprom wants ukraine to pay more for its gas a joint statement signed by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko made public early thursday morning said their country had asked the eu to mediate the dispute with russia , and promised supplies to europe would continue " uninterrupted . " a spokesman for gazprom said it had cut 100 percent of supplies , or 110 million cubic meters of gas per day , meant for ukraine from 10 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- after last-ditch talks new year 's eve on a new deal for gas deliveries failed . " at the current time we have no contract for the deliveries of gas to ukraine , " sergei kupriyanov said in a televised press conference . supplies to european customers further downstream have been increased to 326 million cubic meters per day , he added . ukraine 's gas monopoly naftogaz confirmed it was observing a steady drop in gas pressure , and said it was tapping its gas reserves to make up for the difference , both to domestic and downstream customers . eu reluctant to get involved the eu , however , seemed hesitant about getting involved . speaking on czech television , the new eu head , czech prime minister mirek topolanek , said that the eu was reluctant to broker the bilateral gas dispute . " it is pretty much a russian-ukrainian dispute and it has to be solved as such , " topolanek said . " we will appeal on both parties to reach an agreement as it is not advisable to get involved in the conflict because no one is fully familiar with those contracts , " he said . limited reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu comes from russia limited reserves and a need to protect domestic consumers have forced ukraine to reduce flow to europe by a net 21 million cubic meters per day , said oleh dubina , chairman of the ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftohaz ukrainy . overall supplies to europe from russia on thursday were for practical purposes at normal levels , with a relatively small reduction in flow from ukraine cancelled by an increased flow through belarus . gas supply within ukraine was normal as well , according to eyewitness reports . the breakdown in talks between moscow and kiev has raised fears of a repeat of 2006 , when a similar cutoff caused gas shortages and price spikes in western europe .
gazprom blamed ukrainian siphoning off of gas at the time . tymoshenko reassured eu commission president jose manuel barroso on wednesday that gas transit would continue uninterrupted , but gazprom accused naftogaz of " blackmailing " it with threats in talks to seize transits to europe . over 80 percent of russian gas exports to europe pass through ukrainian pipelines . tough negotiations negotiating positions between the two countries on a new gas contract were still far apart on wednesday evening .
ukraine rejected a russian offer for deliveries at $ 250 -lrb- 179 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters without a change to gas shipment tariffs charged by ukraine for on-shipment to europe . the yushchenko-tymoshenko statement , however , said ukraine could accept a maximum price of $ 201 dollars for russian gas and a minimum 15-percent hike in transit fees . russian prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday called russia 's position " very favorable " for ukraine , and declared the 250 dollar rate the kremlin 's final offer . naftogaz and gazprom officials on thursday traded accusations of breaking off talks , blaming their opposites for the wednesday end to negotiations .
both companies issued statements declaring themselves ready to re-start discussions . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it looks to be a tough tenure as the eu struggles to deal with renewed conflict in the mideast and faces its worst economic crisis in decades . on jan .
1 , the czech republic takes charge of the european union in the midst of global tension over the middle east and european worries over a gas dispute with russia .
the former communist country , which joined the eu only four years ago , has been working hard to prepare for its six months in the spotlight .
in recent weeks , czech officials have been brushing aside concerns that they are not ready for the responsibility of leading the 27-nation bloc .
hard act to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is an outspoken critic of europe skeptics have pointed out that europe is in the midst of a financial crisis , which requires a united european response .
it 's hard for many to imagine that kind of leadership coming from czech president vaclav klaus , a euro skeptic who continuously criticizes most things european in his speeches and statements .
many analysts also point to the fact that prime minister mirek topolanek 's minority government has dragged its feet on the lisbon reform treaty , a charter intended to streamline eu decision making .
the czech republic is one of just three eu members who have yet to ratify the treaty .
it also wo n't be easy for the czech republic to take over the reigns from france .
french president nicolas sarkozy was seen as running an extremely successful agenda-setting presidency up to the very end when he spearheaded diplomatic efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in the middle east .
priorities are set the czech delegation has tried to quell worries over their ability to lead the eu , identifying three main priorities : energy security , external relations and the economy , said czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra " we will be glad if we manage to complete two specific things , " vondra said , alluding to energy security issues and the eu 's eastern partnership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european energy security will be a top agenda item one of the first issues will undoubtedly be the ongoing disagreement between ukraine and russia over gas supplies .
after failing to negotiate an agreement over gas payments for 2009 , russia announced it would cut off gas supplies to ukraine starting jan .
1 .
a cut in deliveries could be felt in europe , which gets most of its russian gas via ukraine .
past disputes between the two countries have lead to reductions in delivery .
eu foreign ministers will gather in prague on jan .
8 , with energy security expected to be a top agenda item .
middle east relations top foreign policy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in the middle east continues to concern europe topping the foreign policy agenda at the start of the year are european efforts to negotiate in the escalating mideast conflict .
on sunday foreign minister karel schwarzenberg is expected to travel to the middle east to work towards a ceasefire in the gaza strip , where israel has killed nearly 400 people in an offensive it says is intended to stop rocket attacks from hamas .
" as soon as he -lrb- schwarzenberg -rrb- takes over the presidency , he feels it is his duty to fly there and start handling it , " a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said .
schwarzenberg , a close ally of washington and pro-israel , defended the strikes .
he put the onus of the latest conflict on hamas and said israel had the right to defend itself .
his position differs sharply from sarkozy 's condemnation of aggression from both sides and calls for an immediate ceasefire .
focus on the economy although the ex-communist state of 10 million people has suffered less than most of the rest of the bloc from plummeting markets , bank bailouts and job losses , the czech republic will have to steer the eu through what is becoming the worst economic crisis in decades .
it wo n't be an easy course , as prague leaders have derided other eu governments for ramping up state spending with stimulus packages to counter falling private sector growth .
the czechs for their part expect slight growth next year and see unemployment rising to just around 6 percent .
such a posturing will put them at odds with big euro zone countries that are already fighting recession , or spain where some economists say unemployment could hit 20 percent . dw staff -lrb- th , ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our customers can count on reliable deliveries , " said martin weyand , chief of the bdew german utilities federation . he said germany did not rely only on pipelines through ukraine to receive russian natural gas , but also on transit via belarus .
in addition , norway , britain and the netherlands supply germany with gas from offshore fields .
he also said germany held large gas stocks . kiev urges eu mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas monopoly gazprom wants ukraine to pay more for its gas a joint statement signed by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko made public early thursday morning said their country had asked the eu to mediate the dispute with russia , and promised supplies to europe would continue " uninterrupted . " a spokesman for gazprom said it had cut 100 percent of supplies , or 110 million cubic meters of gas per day , meant for ukraine from 10 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- after last-ditch talks new year 's eve on a new deal for gas deliveries failed . " at the current time we have no contract for the deliveries of gas to ukraine , " sergei kupriyanov said in a televised press conference . supplies to european customers further downstream have been increased to 326 million cubic meters per day , he added . ukraine 's gas monopoly naftogaz confirmed it was observing a steady drop in gas pressure , and said it was tapping its gas reserves to make up for the difference , both to domestic and downstream customers . eu reluctant to get involved the eu , however , seemed hesitant about getting involved . speaking on czech television , the new eu head , czech prime minister mirek topolanek , said that the eu was reluctant to broker the bilateral gas dispute . " it is pretty much a russian-ukrainian dispute and it has to be solved as such , " topolanek said . " we will appeal on both parties to reach an agreement as it is not advisable to get involved in the conflict because no one is fully familiar with those contracts , " he said . limited reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu comes from russia limited reserves and a need to protect domestic consumers have forced ukraine to reduce flow to europe by a net 21 million cubic meters per day , said oleh dubina , chairman of the ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftohaz ukrainy . overall supplies to europe from russia on thursday were for practical purposes at normal levels , with a relatively small reduction in flow from ukraine cancelled by an increased flow through belarus . gas supply within ukraine was normal as well , according to eyewitness reports . the breakdown in talks between moscow and kiev has raised fears of a repeat of 2006 , when a similar cutoff caused gas shortages and price spikes in western europe .
gazprom blamed ukrainian siphoning off of gas at the time . tymoshenko reassured eu commission president jose manuel barroso on wednesday that gas transit would continue uninterrupted , but gazprom accused naftogaz of " blackmailing " it with threats in talks to seize transits to europe . over 80 percent of russian gas exports to europe pass through ukrainian pipelines . tough negotiations negotiating positions between the two countries on a new gas contract were still far apart on wednesday evening .
ukraine rejected a russian offer for deliveries at $ 250 -lrb- 179 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters without a change to gas shipment tariffs charged by ukraine for on-shipment to europe . the yushchenko-tymoshenko statement , however , said ukraine could accept a maximum price of $ 201 dollars for russian gas and a minimum 15-percent hike in transit fees . russian prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday called russia 's position " very favorable " for ukraine , and declared the 250 dollar rate the kremlin 's final offer . naftogaz and gazprom officials on thursday traded accusations of breaking off talks , blaming their opposites for the wednesday end to negotiations .
both companies issued statements declaring themselves ready to re-start discussions . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it looks to be a tough tenure as the eu struggles to deal with renewed conflict in the mideast and faces its worst economic crisis in decades . on jan .
1 , the czech republic takes charge of the european union in the midst of global tension over the middle east and european worries over a gas dispute with russia .
the former communist country , which joined the eu only four years ago , has been working hard to prepare for its six months in the spotlight .
in recent weeks , czech officials have been brushing aside concerns that they are not ready for the responsibility of leading the 27-nation bloc .
hard act to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is an outspoken critic of europe skeptics have pointed out that europe is in the midst of a financial crisis , which requires a united european response .
it 's hard for many to imagine that kind of leadership coming from czech president vaclav klaus , a euro skeptic who continuously criticizes most things european in his speeches and statements .
many analysts also point to the fact that prime minister mirek topolanek 's minority government has dragged its feet on the lisbon reform treaty , a charter intended to streamline eu decision making .
the czech republic is one of just three eu members who have yet to ratify the treaty .
it also wo n't be easy for the czech republic to take over the reigns from france .
french president nicolas sarkozy was seen as running an extremely successful agenda-setting presidency up to the very end when he spearheaded diplomatic efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in the middle east .
priorities are set the czech delegation has tried to quell worries over their ability to lead the eu , identifying three main priorities : energy security , external relations and the economy , said czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra " we will be glad if we manage to complete two specific things , " vondra said , alluding to energy security issues and the eu 's eastern partnership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european energy security will be a top agenda item one of the first issues will undoubtedly be the ongoing disagreement between ukraine and russia over gas supplies .
after failing to negotiate an agreement over gas payments for 2009 , russia announced it would cut off gas supplies to ukraine starting jan .
1 .
a cut in deliveries could be felt in europe , which gets most of its russian gas via ukraine .
past disputes between the two countries have lead to reductions in delivery .
eu foreign ministers will gather in prague on jan .
8 , with energy security expected to be a top agenda item .
middle east relations top foreign policy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in the middle east continues to concern europe topping the foreign policy agenda at the start of the year are european efforts to negotiate in the escalating mideast conflict .
on sunday foreign minister karel schwarzenberg is expected to travel to the middle east to work towards a ceasefire in the gaza strip , where israel has killed nearly 400 people in an offensive it says is intended to stop rocket attacks from hamas .
" as soon as he -lrb- schwarzenberg -rrb- takes over the presidency , he feels it is his duty to fly there and start handling it , " a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said .
schwarzenberg , a close ally of washington and pro-israel , defended the strikes .
he put the onus of the latest conflict on hamas and said israel had the right to defend itself .
his position differs sharply from sarkozy 's condemnation of aggression from both sides and calls for an immediate ceasefire .
focus on the economy although the ex-communist state of 10 million people has suffered less than most of the rest of the bloc from plummeting markets , bank bailouts and job losses , the czech republic will have to steer the eu through what is becoming the worst economic crisis in decades .

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .
“ for some young people that 's exciting , “ broden said .
the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .

a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .

the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .

it looks to be a tough tenure as the eu struggles to deal with renewed conflict in the mideast and faces its worst economic crisis in decades . on jan .
1 , the czech republic takes charge of the european union in the midst of global tension over the middle east and european worries over a gas dispute with russia .
the former communist country , which joined the eu only four years ago , has been working hard to prepare for its six months in the spotlight .
in recent weeks , czech officials have been brushing aside concerns that they are not ready for the responsibility of leading the 27-nation bloc .
hard act to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is an outspoken critic of europe skeptics have pointed out that europe is in the midst of a financial crisis , which requires a united european response .
it 's hard for many to imagine that kind of leadership coming from czech president vaclav klaus , a euro skeptic who continuously criticizes most things european in his speeches and statements .
many analysts also point to the fact that prime minister mirek topolanek 's minority government has dragged its feet on the lisbon reform treaty , a charter intended to streamline eu decision making .
the czech republic is one of just three eu members who have yet to ratify the treaty .
it also wo n't be easy for the czech republic to take over the reigns from france .
french president nicolas sarkozy was seen as running an extremely successful agenda-setting presidency up to the very end when he spearheaded diplomatic efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in the middle east .
priorities are set the czech delegation has tried to quell worries over their ability to lead the eu , identifying three main priorities : energy security , external relations and the economy , said czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra " we will be glad if we manage to complete two specific things , " vondra said , alluding to energy security issues and the eu 's eastern partnership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european energy security will be a top agenda item one of the first issues will undoubtedly be the ongoing disagreement between ukraine and russia over gas supplies .
after failing to negotiate an agreement over gas payments for 2009 , russia announced it would cut off gas supplies to ukraine starting jan .
1 .
a cut in deliveries could be felt in europe , which gets most of its russian gas via ukraine .
past disputes between the two countries have lead to reductions in delivery .
eu foreign ministers will gather in prague on jan .
8 , with energy security expected to be a top agenda item .
middle east relations top foreign policy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in the middle east continues to concern europe topping the foreign policy agenda at the start of the year are european efforts to negotiate in the escalating mideast conflict .
on sunday foreign minister karel schwarzenberg is expected to travel to the middle east to work towards a ceasefire in the gaza strip , where israel has killed nearly 400 people in an offensive it says is intended to stop rocket attacks from hamas .
" as soon as he -lrb- schwarzenberg -rrb- takes over the presidency , he feels it is his duty to fly there and start handling it , " a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said .
schwarzenberg , a close ally of washington and pro-israel , defended the strikes .
he put the onus of the latest conflict on hamas and said israel had the right to defend itself .
his position differs sharply from sarkozy 's condemnation of aggression from both sides and calls for an immediate ceasefire .
focus on the economy although the ex-communist state of 10 million people has suffered less than most of the rest of the bloc from plummeting markets , bank bailouts and job losses , the czech republic will have to steer the eu through what is becoming the worst economic crisis in decades .
it wo n't be an easy course , as prague leaders have derided other eu governments for ramping up state spending with stimulus packages to counter falling private sector growth .
the czechs for their part expect slight growth next year and see unemployment rising to just around 6 percent .
such a posturing will put them at odds with big euro zone countries that are already fighting recession , or spain where some economists say unemployment could hit 20 percent . dw staff -lrb- th , ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our customers can count on reliable deliveries , " said martin weyand , chief of the bdew german utilities federation . he said germany did not rely only on pipelines through ukraine to receive russian natural gas , but also on transit via belarus .
in addition , norway , britain and the netherlands supply germany with gas from offshore fields .
he also said germany held large gas stocks . kiev urges eu mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas monopoly gazprom wants ukraine to pay more for its gas a joint statement signed by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko made public early thursday morning said their country had asked the eu to mediate the dispute with russia , and promised supplies to europe would continue " uninterrupted . " a spokesman for gazprom said it had cut 100 percent of supplies , or 110 million cubic meters of gas per day , meant for ukraine from 10 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- after last-ditch talks new year 's eve on a new deal for gas deliveries failed . " at the current time we have no contract for the deliveries of gas to ukraine , " sergei kupriyanov said in a televised press conference . supplies to european customers further downstream have been increased to 326 million cubic meters per day , he added . ukraine 's gas monopoly naftogaz confirmed it was observing a steady drop in gas pressure , and said it was tapping its gas reserves to make up for the difference , both to domestic and downstream customers . eu reluctant to get involved the eu , however , seemed hesitant about getting involved . speaking on czech television , the new eu head , czech prime minister mirek topolanek , said that the eu was reluctant to broker the bilateral gas dispute . " it is pretty much a russian-ukrainian dispute and it has to be solved as such , " topolanek said . " we will appeal on both parties to reach an agreement as it is not advisable to get involved in the conflict because no one is fully familiar with those contracts , " he said . limited reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu comes from russia limited reserves and a need to protect domestic consumers have forced ukraine to reduce flow to europe by a net 21 million cubic meters per day , said oleh dubina , chairman of the ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftohaz ukrainy . overall supplies to europe from russia on thursday were for practical purposes at normal levels , with a relatively small reduction in flow from ukraine cancelled by an increased flow through belarus . gas supply within ukraine was normal as well , according to eyewitness reports . the breakdown in talks between moscow and kiev has raised fears of a repeat of 2006 , when a similar cutoff caused gas shortages and price spikes in western europe .
gazprom blamed ukrainian siphoning off of gas at the time . tymoshenko reassured eu commission president jose manuel barroso on wednesday that gas transit would continue uninterrupted , but gazprom accused naftogaz of " blackmailing " it with threats in talks to seize transits to europe . over 80 percent of russian gas exports to europe pass through ukrainian pipelines . tough negotiations negotiating positions between the two countries on a new gas contract were still far apart on wednesday evening .
ukraine rejected a russian offer for deliveries at $ 250 -lrb- 179 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters without a change to gas shipment tariffs charged by ukraine for on-shipment to europe . the yushchenko-tymoshenko statement , however , said ukraine could accept a maximum price of $ 201 dollars for russian gas and a minimum 15-percent hike in transit fees . russian prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday called russia 's position " very favorable " for ukraine , and declared the 250 dollar rate the kremlin 's final offer . naftogaz and gazprom officials on thursday traded accusations of breaking off talks , blaming their opposites for the wednesday end to negotiations .
both companies issued statements declaring themselves ready to re-start discussions . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel argued that it is the victim of terrorist attacks . also during the visit to france , livni told french foreign minister bernard kouchner that there was no need for a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons as there is no humanitarian crisis in the gaza strip . after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , livni told reporters that israel is bringing about change in the gaza strip by attacking militants and providing support to centrists . she added that sarkozy understood the situation . germany asks israel to consider arab proposals german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed on thursday to israel to respond " constructively " to arab league efforts for a halt in the fighting in the gaza strip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have caused considerable damage in gaza he telephoned israeli foreign minister tzipi livni to voice " his great concern about the continuation of the fighting , " his office said in berlin . he told her the fighting endangered progress to date in the middle east peace process and undermined the stance of those arabs who were willing to engage with israel . but he also said the pre-condition for a truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas authorities in the gaza strip . a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel meanwhile rejected criticism of her forthright support for israel during the conflict with hamas . merkel 's assessment , offered during her new year address , matched that of the european union foreign ministers , the spokesman said . she had made it clear that she too desired a truce in the fighting as soon as possible , he added . " however conditions have to be met , and the most important condition in the view of the chancellor is that israel 's security must be secured , " said the spokesman at her office . senior hamas leader killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians protested the killing of nizar rayan and his family earlier on thursday , an israeli airstrike killed a senior hamas leader , his wife and eight children . nizar rayan and his family were killed when his house was struck in the northern gaza refugee camp of jabaliya , kamal odwan hospital in the refugee camp confirmed .
rayan was the most senior hamas leader killed so far in six days of ferocious israeli airstrikes .
most top leaders of the movement have gone into hiding .
rayan , in his 50s , was a senior political leader of hamas in the north of the strip , but also close to the movement 's armed wing , the al-qassam brigades .
he led the al-qassam brigades and the palestinian resistance during several israeli military ground incursions into the strip in the past .
an israeli military spokeswoman could not immediately confirm he was the target of the strike , but said the israel air force had hit several buildings in jabaliya used by hamas for storing rockets .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international pressure to end six days of violence showed little immediate effect on thursday morning , an israeli military spokesman said that the air force and navy had carried out around 20 operations since midnight , hitting , among other targets , the palestinian legislative council building , the hamas-run ministry of justice , tunnels running under the gaza-egyptian border , and a hamas arms depot .
militants fired around five missiles and mortars thursday morning , including grad missiles which struck the israeli city of beersheba .
there were no reports of injuries .
israeli army ground troops from the engineering and armoured corps , meanwhile , were massing on the israel-gaza border , waiting for the order to enter the enclave .
israel radio quoted a military official as saying that the ground operation , which is believed imminent , would involve many soldiers , but would be limited in scope .

it looks to be a tough tenure as the eu struggles to deal with renewed conflict in the mideast and faces its worst economic crisis in decades . on jan .
1 , the czech republic takes charge of the european union in the midst of global tension over the middle east and european worries over a gas dispute with russia .
the former communist country , which joined the eu only four years ago , has been working hard to prepare for its six months in the spotlight .
in recent weeks , czech officials have been brushing aside concerns that they are not ready for the responsibility of leading the 27-nation bloc .
hard act to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is an outspoken critic of europe skeptics have pointed out that europe is in the midst of a financial crisis , which requires a united european response .
it 's hard for many to imagine that kind of leadership coming from czech president vaclav klaus , a euro skeptic who continuously criticizes most things european in his speeches and statements .
many analysts also point to the fact that prime minister mirek topolanek 's minority government has dragged its feet on the lisbon reform treaty , a charter intended to streamline eu decision making .
the czech republic is one of just three eu members who have yet to ratify the treaty .
it also wo n't be easy for the czech republic to take over the reigns from france .
french president nicolas sarkozy was seen as running an extremely successful agenda-setting presidency up to the very end when he spearheaded diplomatic efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in the middle east .
priorities are set the czech delegation has tried to quell worries over their ability to lead the eu , identifying three main priorities : energy security , external relations and the economy , said czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra " we will be glad if we manage to complete two specific things , " vondra said , alluding to energy security issues and the eu 's eastern partnership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european energy security will be a top agenda item one of the first issues will undoubtedly be the ongoing disagreement between ukraine and russia over gas supplies .
after failing to negotiate an agreement over gas payments for 2009 , russia announced it would cut off gas supplies to ukraine starting jan .
1 .
a cut in deliveries could be felt in europe , which gets most of its russian gas via ukraine .
past disputes between the two countries have lead to reductions in delivery .
eu foreign ministers will gather in prague on jan .

israel argued that it is the victim of terrorist attacks . also during the visit to france , livni told french foreign minister bernard kouchner that there was no need for a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons as there is no humanitarian crisis in the gaza strip . after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , livni told reporters that israel is bringing about change in the gaza strip by attacking militants and providing support to centrists . she added that sarkozy understood the situation . germany asks israel to consider arab proposals german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed on thursday to israel to respond " constructively " to arab league efforts for a halt in the fighting in the gaza strip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have caused considerable damage in gaza he telephoned israeli foreign minister tzipi livni to voice " his great concern about the continuation of the fighting , " his office said in berlin . he told her the fighting endangered progress to date in the middle east peace process and undermined the stance of those arabs who were willing to engage with israel . but he also said the pre-condition for a truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas authorities in the gaza strip . a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel meanwhile rejected criticism of her forthright support for israel during the conflict with hamas . merkel 's assessment , offered during her new year address , matched that of the european union foreign ministers , the spokesman said . she had made it clear that she too desired a truce in the fighting as soon as possible , he added .

rayan was the most senior hamas leader killed so far in six days of ferocious israeli airstrikes .
most top leaders of the movement have gone into hiding .
rayan , in his 50s , was a senior political leader of hamas in the north of the strip , but also close to the movement 's armed wing , the al-qassam brigades .
he led the al-qassam brigades and the palestinian resistance during several israeli military ground incursions into the strip in the past .
an israeli military spokeswoman could not immediately confirm he was the target of the strike , but said the israel air force had hit several buildings in jabaliya used by hamas for storing rockets .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international pressure to end six days of violence showed little immediate effect on thursday morning , an israeli military spokesman said that the air force and navy had carried out around 20 operations since midnight , hitting , among other targets , the palestinian legislative council building , the hamas-run ministry of justice , tunnels running under the gaza-egyptian border , and a hamas arms depot .
militants fired around five missiles and mortars thursday morning , including grad missiles which struck the israeli city of beersheba .
there were no reports of injuries .
israeli army ground troops from the engineering and armoured corps , meanwhile , were massing on the israel-gaza border , waiting for the order to enter the enclave .
israel radio quoted a military official as saying that the ground operation , which is believed imminent , would involve many soldiers , but would be limited in scope .

it looks to be a tough tenure as the eu struggles to deal with renewed conflict in the mideast and faces its worst economic crisis in decades . on jan .
1 , the czech republic takes charge of the european union in the midst of global tension over the middle east and european worries over a gas dispute with russia .
the former communist country , which joined the eu only four years ago , has been working hard to prepare for its six months in the spotlight .
in recent weeks , czech officials have been brushing aside concerns that they are not ready for the responsibility of leading the 27-nation bloc .
hard act to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is an outspoken critic of europe skeptics have pointed out that europe is in the midst of a financial crisis , which requires a united european response .
it 's hard for many to imagine that kind of leadership coming from czech president vaclav klaus , a euro skeptic who continuously criticizes most things european in his speeches and statements .
many analysts also point to the fact that prime minister mirek topolanek 's minority government has dragged its feet on the lisbon reform treaty , a charter intended to streamline eu decision making .
the czech republic is one of just three eu members who have yet to ratify the treaty .
it also wo n't be easy for the czech republic to take over the reigns from france .
french president nicolas sarkozy was seen as running an extremely successful agenda-setting presidency up to the very end when he spearheaded diplomatic efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in the middle east .
priorities are set the czech delegation has tried to quell worries over their ability to lead the eu , identifying three main priorities : energy security , external relations and the economy , said czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra " we will be glad if we manage to complete two specific things , " vondra said , alluding to energy security issues and the eu 's eastern partnership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european energy security will be a top agenda item one of the first issues will undoubtedly be the ongoing disagreement between ukraine and russia over gas supplies .
after failing to negotiate an agreement over gas payments for 2009 , russia announced it would cut off gas supplies to ukraine starting jan .
1 .
a cut in deliveries could be felt in europe , which gets most of its russian gas via ukraine .
past disputes between the two countries have lead to reductions in delivery .
eu foreign ministers will gather in prague on jan .
8 , with energy security expected to be a top agenda item .
middle east relations top foreign policy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in the middle east continues to concern europe topping the foreign policy agenda at the start of the year are european efforts to negotiate in the escalating mideast conflict .
on sunday foreign minister karel schwarzenberg is expected to travel to the middle east to work towards a ceasefire in the gaza strip , where israel has killed nearly 400 people in an offensive it says is intended to stop rocket attacks from hamas .
" as soon as he -lrb- schwarzenberg -rrb- takes over the presidency , he feels it is his duty to fly there and start handling it , " a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said .
schwarzenberg , a close ally of washington and pro-israel , defended the strikes .

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 01.01.2009 german organizations help youth fight pull of extreme right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks by rightwing extremists are on the rise in germany new figures show that extreme right-wing crime has increased by almost a third in germany in the past year .
a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .
“ for some young people that 's exciting , “ broden said .
the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .
violent attacks were up , as were incidents of anti-semitism .
these figures are proof that there 's still a long way to go before the efforts of martin schneider , anne broden and their colleagues are reflected in the annual statistics . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .
“ for some young people that 's exciting , “ broden said .
the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .
violent attacks were up , as were incidents of anti-semitism .

fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .

the small town is using the opportunity to face up to its past as nazi dictator adolf hitler 's favorite city . some european capitals of culture are luckier than others .
while this year liverpool banked on the beatles , the austrian town of linz has to grapple with its connection to adolf hitler in 2009 . but besides using the opportunity to deal with the fact that hitler planned to make linz a major cultural center of the third reich , the steel town along the danube river will offer a host of quirky cultural projects geared towards a wide public rather than a select few . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linz is taking an irreverent approach to the cultural capital concept " linz is an unknown creature even for austrians , " mayor franz dobusch said of this town which was first mentioned as a medieval trading hub in 799 , but which remained a small provincial center until the 20th century . while few austrians know about the medieval alleys of the historical center , most associate linz with voestalpine ag , the steel producer that was founded as part of nazi germany 's industrial complex in 1938 , after austria was annexed by the german reich . hitler 's cultural capital in the exhibition " the cultural capital of the fuehrer , " which runs until march , visitors travelling some 190 kilometers west of vienna to linz have a chance to examine hitler 's grandiose plans to make the town into a cultural center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his love for linz , hitler had no problem setting up the infamous mauthausen death camp nearby hitler spent some of his childhood and youth in linz .

" whenever you come to linz in the coming year , you will find something related to this topic , " said ulrich fuchs , the deputy manager of the 2009 events . home visits when linz took over as cultural capital on new year 's eve , along with lithuania 's capital vilnius , the opening event signaled that the working-class town wanted to offer projects that appeal to visitors and the local public alike . on dec .
31 , official guests were not treated to a formal dinner , but were rather invited into the homes of locals , including families , university students and gay couples . " of course we see to it that we do n't send the israeli ambassador to a palestinian family , of all places , " fuchs said . unusual projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new ars electronica building besides the annual ars electronica festival of media and electronic art , and an exhibition called " best of austria " , featuring works from the country 's most famous museums , there are few traditional cultural events , but a host of unusual projects . in may , a group of artists organizes " surveillance-free tours " , for which participants don camouflage gear and sneak and crawl their way to tourist sites , evading the gaze of security cameras . at a festival in november , linz will host a number of international puppet theater players with productions geared towards adults , such as a production by neville tranter , who will present the traditional irreverent puppet character punch as a bomb-planting terrorist . unusual accommodation those wishing to combine unusual cultural experiences with unusual accommodation can check in at the pixel hotel , which is not really a hotel but rather a number of rooms installed all over linz , including in a former cabinet maker 's workshop , a former soup kitchen , and a ship in the danube harbor . as the mayor of a provincial town , mayor dobusch is realistic about his goals for 2009 . " we want to attract people in a 300-kilometer radius " , he said , referring to an area including parts of germany , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia and northern italy .

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" of course we see to it that we do n't send the israeli ambassador to a palestinian family , of all places , " fuchs said . unusual projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new ars electronica building besides the annual ars electronica festival of media and electronic art , and an exhibition called " best of austria " , featuring works from the country 's most famous museums , there are few traditional cultural events , but a host of unusual projects . in may , a group of artists organizes " surveillance-free tours " , for which participants don camouflage gear and sneak and crawl their way to tourist sites , evading the gaze of security cameras . at a festival in november , linz will host a number of international puppet theater players with productions geared towards adults , such as a production by neville tranter , who will present the traditional irreverent puppet character punch as a bomb-planting terrorist . unusual accommodation those wishing to combine unusual cultural experiences with unusual accommodation can check in at the pixel hotel , which is not really a hotel but rather a number of rooms installed all over linz , including in a former cabinet maker 's workshop , a former soup kitchen , and a ship in the danube harbor . as the mayor of a provincial town , mayor dobusch is realistic about his goals for 2009 . " we want to attract people in a 300-kilometer radius " , he said , referring to an area including parts of germany , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia and northern italy .

" our customers can count on reliable deliveries , " said martin weyand , chief of the bdew german utilities federation . he said germany did not rely only on pipelines through ukraine to receive russian natural gas , but also on transit via belarus .
in addition , norway , britain and the netherlands supply germany with gas from offshore fields .
he also said germany held large gas stocks . kiev urges eu mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas monopoly gazprom wants ukraine to pay more for its gas a joint statement signed by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko made public early thursday morning said their country had asked the eu to mediate the dispute with russia , and promised supplies to europe would continue " uninterrupted . " a spokesman for gazprom said it had cut 100 percent of supplies , or 110 million cubic meters of gas per day , meant for ukraine from 10 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- after last-ditch talks new year 's eve on a new deal for gas deliveries failed . " at the current time we have no contract for the deliveries of gas to ukraine , " sergei kupriyanov said in a televised press conference . supplies to european customers further downstream have been increased to 326 million cubic meters per day , he added . ukraine 's gas monopoly naftogaz confirmed it was observing a steady drop in gas pressure , and said it was tapping its gas reserves to make up for the difference , both to domestic and downstream customers . eu reluctant to get involved the eu , however , seemed hesitant about getting involved . speaking on czech television , the new eu head , czech prime minister mirek topolanek , said that the eu was reluctant to broker the bilateral gas dispute . " it is pretty much a russian-ukrainian dispute and it has to be solved as such , " topolanek said . " we will appeal on both parties to reach an agreement as it is not advisable to get involved in the conflict because no one is fully familiar with those contracts , " he said . limited reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu comes from russia limited reserves and a need to protect domestic consumers have forced ukraine to reduce flow to europe by a net 21 million cubic meters per day , said oleh dubina , chairman of the ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftohaz ukrainy . overall supplies to europe from russia on thursday were for practical purposes at normal levels , with a relatively small reduction in flow from ukraine cancelled by an increased flow through belarus . gas supply within ukraine was normal as well , according to eyewitness reports . the breakdown in talks between moscow and kiev has raised fears of a repeat of 2006 , when a similar cutoff caused gas shortages and price spikes in western europe .
gazprom blamed ukrainian siphoning off of gas at the time . tymoshenko reassured eu commission president jose manuel barroso on wednesday that gas transit would continue uninterrupted , but gazprom accused naftogaz of " blackmailing " it with threats in talks to seize transits to europe . over 80 percent of russian gas exports to europe pass through ukrainian pipelines . tough negotiations negotiating positions between the two countries on a new gas contract were still far apart on wednesday evening .
ukraine rejected a russian offer for deliveries at $ 250 -lrb- 179 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters without a change to gas shipment tariffs charged by ukraine for on-shipment to europe . the yushchenko-tymoshenko statement , however , said ukraine could accept a maximum price of $ 201 dollars for russian gas and a minimum 15-percent hike in transit fees . russian prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday called russia 's position " very favorable " for ukraine , and declared the 250 dollar rate the kremlin 's final offer . naftogaz and gazprom officials on thursday traded accusations of breaking off talks , blaming their opposites for the wednesday end to negotiations .
both companies issued statements declaring themselves ready to re-start discussions . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .
“ for some young people that 's exciting , “ broden said .
the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .
violent attacks were up , as were incidents of anti-semitism .

he also said germany held large gas stocks . kiev urges eu mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas monopoly gazprom wants ukraine to pay more for its gas a joint statement signed by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko made public early thursday morning said their country had asked the eu to mediate the dispute with russia , and promised supplies to europe would continue " uninterrupted . " a spokesman for gazprom said it had cut 100 percent of supplies , or 110 million cubic meters of gas per day , meant for ukraine from 10 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- after last-ditch talks new year 's eve on a new deal for gas deliveries failed . " at the current time we have no contract for the deliveries of gas to ukraine , " sergei kupriyanov said in a televised press conference . supplies to european customers further downstream have been increased to 326 million cubic meters per day , he added . ukraine 's gas monopoly naftogaz confirmed it was observing a steady drop in gas pressure , and said it was tapping its gas reserves to make up for the difference , both to domestic and downstream customers . eu reluctant to get involved the eu , however , seemed hesitant about getting involved . speaking on czech television , the new eu head , czech prime minister mirek topolanek , said that the eu was reluctant to broker the bilateral gas dispute . " it is pretty much a russian-ukrainian dispute and it has to be solved as such , " topolanek said . " we will appeal on both parties to reach an agreement as it is not advisable to get involved in the conflict because no one is fully familiar with those contracts , " he said . limited reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu comes from russia limited reserves and a need to protect domestic consumers have forced ukraine to reduce flow to europe by a net 21 million cubic meters per day , said oleh dubina , chairman of the ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftohaz ukrainy . overall supplies to europe from russia on thursday were for practical purposes at normal levels , with a relatively small reduction in flow from ukraine cancelled by an increased flow through belarus . gas supply within ukraine was normal as well , according to eyewitness reports . the breakdown in talks between moscow and kiev has raised fears of a repeat of 2006 , when a similar cutoff caused gas shortages and price spikes in western europe .
gazprom blamed ukrainian siphoning off of gas at the time . tymoshenko reassured eu commission president jose manuel barroso on wednesday that gas transit would continue uninterrupted , but gazprom accused naftogaz of " blackmailing " it with threats in talks to seize transits to europe . over 80 percent of russian gas exports to europe pass through ukrainian pipelines . tough negotiations negotiating positions between the two countries on a new gas contract were still far apart on wednesday evening .
ukraine rejected a russian offer for deliveries at $ 250 -lrb- 179 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters without a change to gas shipment tariffs charged by ukraine for on-shipment to europe . the yushchenko-tymoshenko statement , however , said ukraine could accept a maximum price of $ 201 dollars for russian gas and a minimum 15-percent hike in transit fees . russian prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday called russia 's position " very favorable " for ukraine , and declared the 250 dollar rate the kremlin 's final offer . naftogaz and gazprom officials on thursday traded accusations of breaking off talks , blaming their opposites for the wednesday end to negotiations .
both companies issued statements declaring themselves ready to re-start discussions . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the small town is using the opportunity to face up to its past as nazi dictator adolf hitler 's favorite city . some european capitals of culture are luckier than others .
while this year liverpool banked on the beatles , the austrian town of linz has to grapple with its connection to adolf hitler in 2009 . but besides using the opportunity to deal with the fact that hitler planned to make linz a major cultural center of the third reich , the steel town along the danube river will offer a host of quirky cultural projects geared towards a wide public rather than a select few . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linz is taking an irreverent approach to the cultural capital concept " linz is an unknown creature even for austrians , " mayor franz dobusch said of this town which was first mentioned as a medieval trading hub in 799 , but which remained a small provincial center until the 20th century . while few austrians know about the medieval alleys of the historical center , most associate linz with voestalpine ag , the steel producer that was founded as part of nazi germany 's industrial complex in 1938 , after austria was annexed by the german reich . hitler 's cultural capital in the exhibition " the cultural capital of the fuehrer , " which runs until march , visitors travelling some 190 kilometers west of vienna to linz have a chance to examine hitler 's grandiose plans to make the town into a cultural center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his love for linz , hitler had no problem setting up the infamous mauthausen death camp nearby hitler spent some of his childhood and youth in linz .

31 , official guests were not treated to a formal dinner , but were rather invited into the homes of locals , including families , university students and gay couples . " of course we see to it that we do n't send the israeli ambassador to a palestinian family , of all places , " fuchs said . unusual projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new ars electronica building besides the annual ars electronica festival of media and electronic art , and an exhibition called " best of austria " , featuring works from the country 's most famous museums , there are few traditional cultural events , but a host of unusual projects . in may , a group of artists organizes " surveillance-free tours " , for which participants don camouflage gear and sneak and crawl their way to tourist sites , evading the gaze of security cameras . at a festival in november , linz will host a number of international puppet theater players with productions geared towards adults , such as a production by neville tranter , who will present the traditional irreverent puppet character punch as a bomb-planting terrorist . unusual accommodation those wishing to combine unusual cultural experiences with unusual accommodation can check in at the pixel hotel , which is not really a hotel but rather a number of rooms installed all over linz , including in a former cabinet maker 's workshop , a former soup kitchen , and a ship in the danube harbor . as the mayor of a provincial town , mayor dobusch is realistic about his goals for 2009 . " we want to attract people in a 300-kilometer radius " , he said , referring to an area including parts of germany , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia and northern italy .

the small town is using the opportunity to face up to its past as nazi dictator adolf hitler 's favorite city . some european capitals of culture are luckier than others .
while this year liverpool banked on the beatles , the austrian town of linz has to grapple with its connection to adolf hitler in 2009 . but besides using the opportunity to deal with the fact that hitler planned to make linz a major cultural center of the third reich , the steel town along the danube river will offer a host of quirky cultural projects geared towards a wide public rather than a select few . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linz is taking an irreverent approach to the cultural capital concept " linz is an unknown creature even for austrians , " mayor franz dobusch said of this town which was first mentioned as a medieval trading hub in 799 , but which remained a small provincial center until the 20th century . while few austrians know about the medieval alleys of the historical center , most associate linz with voestalpine ag , the steel producer that was founded as part of nazi germany 's industrial complex in 1938 , after austria was annexed by the german reich . hitler 's cultural capital in the exhibition " the cultural capital of the fuehrer , " which runs until march , visitors travelling some 190 kilometers west of vienna to linz have a chance to examine hitler 's grandiose plans to make the town into a cultural center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his love for linz , hitler had no problem setting up the infamous mauthausen death camp nearby hitler spent some of his childhood and youth in linz .

" whenever you come to linz in the coming year , you will find something related to this topic , " said ulrich fuchs , the deputy manager of the 2009 events . home visits when linz took over as cultural capital on new year 's eve , along with lithuania 's capital vilnius , the opening event signaled that the working-class town wanted to offer projects that appeal to visitors and the local public alike . on dec .
31 , official guests were not treated to a formal dinner , but were rather invited into the homes of locals , including families , university students and gay couples . " of course we see to it that we do n't send the israeli ambassador to a palestinian family , of all places , " fuchs said . unusual projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new ars electronica building besides the annual ars electronica festival of media and electronic art , and an exhibition called " best of austria " , featuring works from the country 's most famous museums , there are few traditional cultural events , but a host of unusual projects . in may , a group of artists organizes " surveillance-free tours " , for which participants don camouflage gear and sneak and crawl their way to tourist sites , evading the gaze of security cameras . at a festival in november , linz will host a number of international puppet theater players with productions geared towards adults , such as a production by neville tranter , who will present the traditional irreverent puppet character punch as a bomb-planting terrorist . unusual accommodation those wishing to combine unusual cultural experiences with unusual accommodation can check in at the pixel hotel , which is not really a hotel but rather a number of rooms installed all over linz , including in a former cabinet maker 's workshop , a former soup kitchen , and a ship in the danube harbor . as the mayor of a provincial town , mayor dobusch is realistic about his goals for 2009 . " we want to attract people in a 300-kilometer radius " , he said , referring to an area including parts of germany , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia and northern italy .

" our customers can count on reliable deliveries , " said martin weyand , chief of the bdew german utilities federation . he said germany did not rely only on pipelines through ukraine to receive russian natural gas , but also on transit via belarus .
in addition , norway , britain and the netherlands supply germany with gas from offshore fields .
he also said germany held large gas stocks . kiev urges eu mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas monopoly gazprom wants ukraine to pay more for its gas a joint statement signed by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko made public early thursday morning said their country had asked the eu to mediate the dispute with russia , and promised supplies to europe would continue " uninterrupted . " a spokesman for gazprom said it had cut 100 percent of supplies , or 110 million cubic meters of gas per day , meant for ukraine from 10 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- after last-ditch talks new year 's eve on a new deal for gas deliveries failed . " at the current time we have no contract for the deliveries of gas to ukraine , " sergei kupriyanov said in a televised press conference . supplies to european customers further downstream have been increased to 326 million cubic meters per day , he added . ukraine 's gas monopoly naftogaz confirmed it was observing a steady drop in gas pressure , and said it was tapping its gas reserves to make up for the difference , both to domestic and downstream customers . eu reluctant to get involved the eu , however , seemed hesitant about getting involved . speaking on czech television , the new eu head , czech prime minister mirek topolanek , said that the eu was reluctant to broker the bilateral gas dispute . " it is pretty much a russian-ukrainian dispute and it has to be solved as such , " topolanek said . " we will appeal on both parties to reach an agreement as it is not advisable to get involved in the conflict because no one is fully familiar with those contracts , " he said . limited reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu comes from russia limited reserves and a need to protect domestic consumers have forced ukraine to reduce flow to europe by a net 21 million cubic meters per day , said oleh dubina , chairman of the ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftohaz ukrainy . overall supplies to europe from russia on thursday were for practical purposes at normal levels , with a relatively small reduction in flow from ukraine cancelled by an increased flow through belarus . gas supply within ukraine was normal as well , according to eyewitness reports . the breakdown in talks between moscow and kiev has raised fears of a repeat of 2006 , when a similar cutoff caused gas shortages and price spikes in western europe .
gazprom blamed ukrainian siphoning off of gas at the time . tymoshenko reassured eu commission president jose manuel barroso on wednesday that gas transit would continue uninterrupted , but gazprom accused naftogaz of " blackmailing " it with threats in talks to seize transits to europe . over 80 percent of russian gas exports to europe pass through ukrainian pipelines . tough negotiations negotiating positions between the two countries on a new gas contract were still far apart on wednesday evening .
ukraine rejected a russian offer for deliveries at $ 250 -lrb- 179 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters without a change to gas shipment tariffs charged by ukraine for on-shipment to europe . the yushchenko-tymoshenko statement , however , said ukraine could accept a maximum price of $ 201 dollars for russian gas and a minimum 15-percent hike in transit fees . russian prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday called russia 's position " very favorable " for ukraine , and declared the 250 dollar rate the kremlin 's final offer . naftogaz and gazprom officials on thursday traded accusations of breaking off talks , blaming their opposites for the wednesday end to negotiations .
both companies issued statements declaring themselves ready to re-start discussions . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it looks to be a tough tenure as the eu struggles to deal with renewed conflict in the mideast and faces its worst economic crisis in decades . on jan .
1 , the czech republic takes charge of the european union in the midst of global tension over the middle east and european worries over a gas dispute with russia .
the former communist country , which joined the eu only four years ago , has been working hard to prepare for its six months in the spotlight .
in recent weeks , czech officials have been brushing aside concerns that they are not ready for the responsibility of leading the 27-nation bloc .
hard act to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus is an outspoken critic of europe skeptics have pointed out that europe is in the midst of a financial crisis , which requires a united european response .
it 's hard for many to imagine that kind of leadership coming from czech president vaclav klaus , a euro skeptic who continuously criticizes most things european in his speeches and statements .
many analysts also point to the fact that prime minister mirek topolanek 's minority government has dragged its feet on the lisbon reform treaty , a charter intended to streamline eu decision making .
the czech republic is one of just three eu members who have yet to ratify the treaty .
it also wo n't be easy for the czech republic to take over the reigns from france .
french president nicolas sarkozy was seen as running an extremely successful agenda-setting presidency up to the very end when he spearheaded diplomatic efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in the middle east .
priorities are set the czech delegation has tried to quell worries over their ability to lead the eu , identifying three main priorities : energy security , external relations and the economy , said czech deputy prime minister alexandr vondra " we will be glad if we manage to complete two specific things , " vondra said , alluding to energy security issues and the eu 's eastern partnership .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european energy security will be a top agenda item one of the first issues will undoubtedly be the ongoing disagreement between ukraine and russia over gas supplies .
after failing to negotiate an agreement over gas payments for 2009 , russia announced it would cut off gas supplies to ukraine starting jan .
1 .
a cut in deliveries could be felt in europe , which gets most of its russian gas via ukraine .
past disputes between the two countries have lead to reductions in delivery .
eu foreign ministers will gather in prague on jan .
8 , with energy security expected to be a top agenda item .
middle east relations top foreign policy agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in the middle east continues to concern europe topping the foreign policy agenda at the start of the year are european efforts to negotiate in the escalating mideast conflict .
on sunday foreign minister karel schwarzenberg is expected to travel to the middle east to work towards a ceasefire in the gaza strip , where israel has killed nearly 400 people in an offensive it says is intended to stop rocket attacks from hamas .
" as soon as he -lrb- schwarzenberg -rrb- takes over the presidency , he feels it is his duty to fly there and start handling it , " a spokesperson for the foreign ministry said .
schwarzenberg , a close ally of washington and pro-israel , defended the strikes .
he put the onus of the latest conflict on hamas and said israel had the right to defend itself .
his position differs sharply from sarkozy 's condemnation of aggression from both sides and calls for an immediate ceasefire .
focus on the economy although the ex-communist state of 10 million people has suffered less than most of the rest of the bloc from plummeting markets , bank bailouts and job losses , the czech republic will have to steer the eu through what is becoming the worst economic crisis in decades .
it wo n't be an easy course , as prague leaders have derided other eu governments for ramping up state spending with stimulus packages to counter falling private sector growth .
the czechs for their part expect slight growth next year and see unemployment rising to just around 6 percent .
such a posturing will put them at odds with big euro zone countries that are already fighting recession , or spain where some economists say unemployment could hit 20 percent . dw staff -lrb- th , ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the small town is using the opportunity to face up to its past as nazi dictator adolf hitler 's favorite city . some european capitals of culture are luckier than others .
while this year liverpool banked on the beatles , the austrian town of linz has to grapple with its connection to adolf hitler in 2009 . but besides using the opportunity to deal with the fact that hitler planned to make linz a major cultural center of the third reich , the steel town along the danube river will offer a host of quirky cultural projects geared towards a wide public rather than a select few . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linz is taking an irreverent approach to the cultural capital concept " linz is an unknown creature even for austrians , " mayor franz dobusch said of this town which was first mentioned as a medieval trading hub in 799 , but which remained a small provincial center until the 20th century . while few austrians know about the medieval alleys of the historical center , most associate linz with voestalpine ag , the steel producer that was founded as part of nazi germany 's industrial complex in 1938 , after austria was annexed by the german reich . hitler 's cultural capital in the exhibition " the cultural capital of the fuehrer , " which runs until march , visitors travelling some 190 kilometers west of vienna to linz have a chance to examine hitler 's grandiose plans to make the town into a cultural center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his love for linz , hitler had no problem setting up the infamous mauthausen death camp nearby hitler spent some of his childhood and youth in linz .

armed with an audio guide , one can listen to survivors while being led through a residential area and a former underground aircraft factory that were part of the gusen concentration camp . " whenever you come to linz in the coming year , you will find something related to this topic , " said ulrich fuchs , the deputy manager of the 2009 events . home visits when linz took over as cultural capital on new year 's eve , along with lithuania 's capital vilnius , the opening event signaled that the working-class town wanted to offer projects that appeal to visitors and the local public alike . on dec .
31 , official guests were not treated to a formal dinner , but were rather invited into the homes of locals , including families , university students and gay couples . " of course we see to it that we do n't send the israeli ambassador to a palestinian family , of all places , " fuchs said . unusual projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new ars electronica building besides the annual ars electronica festival of media and electronic art , and an exhibition called " best of austria " , featuring works from the country 's most famous museums , there are few traditional cultural events , but a host of unusual projects . in may , a group of artists organizes " surveillance-free tours " , for which participants don camouflage gear and sneak and crawl their way to tourist sites , evading the gaze of security cameras . at a festival in november , linz will host a number of international puppet theater players with productions geared towards adults , such as a production by neville tranter , who will present the traditional irreverent puppet character punch as a bomb-planting terrorist . unusual accommodation those wishing to combine unusual cultural experiences with unusual accommodation can check in at the pixel hotel , which is not really a hotel but rather a number of rooms installed all over linz , including in a former cabinet maker 's workshop , a former soup kitchen , and a ship in the danube harbor . as the mayor of a provincial town , mayor dobusch is realistic about his goals for 2009 . " we want to attract people in a 300-kilometer radius " , he said , referring to an area including parts of germany , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia and northern italy .

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 01.01.2009 german organizations help youth fight pull of extreme right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks by rightwing extremists are on the rise in germany new figures show that extreme right-wing crime has increased by almost a third in germany in the past year .
a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .
“ for some young people that 's exciting , “ broden said .
the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .
violent attacks were up , as were incidents of anti-semitism .
these figures are proof that there 's still a long way to go before the efforts of martin schneider , anne broden and their colleagues are reflected in the annual statistics . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 01.01.2009 german organizations help youth fight pull of extreme right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks by rightwing extremists are on the rise in germany new figures show that extreme right-wing crime has increased by almost a third in germany in the past year .
a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .
“ for some young people that 's exciting , “ broden said .
the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .
violent attacks were up , as were incidents of anti-semitism .
these figures are proof that there 's still a long way to go before the efforts of martin schneider , anne broden and their colleagues are reflected in the annual statistics . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israel argued that it is the victim of terrorist attacks . also during the visit to france , livni told french foreign minister bernard kouchner that there was no need for a ceasefire for humanitarian reasons as there is no humanitarian crisis in the gaza strip . after meeting with french president nicolas sarkozy , livni told reporters that israel is bringing about change in the gaza strip by attacking militants and providing support to centrists . she added that sarkozy understood the situation . germany asks israel to consider arab proposals german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier appealed on thursday to israel to respond " constructively " to arab league efforts for a halt in the fighting in the gaza strip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli air strikes have caused considerable damage in gaza he telephoned israeli foreign minister tzipi livni to voice " his great concern about the continuation of the fighting , " his office said in berlin . he told her the fighting endangered progress to date in the middle east peace process and undermined the stance of those arabs who were willing to engage with israel . but he also said the pre-condition for a truce had to be the cessation of missile attacks against israel by the radical hamas authorities in the gaza strip . a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel meanwhile rejected criticism of her forthright support for israel during the conflict with hamas . merkel 's assessment , offered during her new year address , matched that of the european union foreign ministers , the spokesman said . she had made it clear that she too desired a truce in the fighting as soon as possible , he added . " however conditions have to be met , and the most important condition in the view of the chancellor is that israel 's security must be secured , " said the spokesman at her office . senior hamas leader killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians protested the killing of nizar rayan and his family earlier on thursday , an israeli airstrike killed a senior hamas leader , his wife and eight children . nizar rayan and his family were killed when his house was struck in the northern gaza refugee camp of jabaliya , kamal odwan hospital in the refugee camp confirmed .
rayan was the most senior hamas leader killed so far in six days of ferocious israeli airstrikes .
most top leaders of the movement have gone into hiding .
rayan , in his 50s , was a senior political leader of hamas in the north of the strip , but also close to the movement 's armed wing , the al-qassam brigades .
he led the al-qassam brigades and the palestinian resistance during several israeli military ground incursions into the strip in the past .
an israeli military spokeswoman could not immediately confirm he was the target of the strike , but said the israel air force had hit several buildings in jabaliya used by hamas for storing rockets .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international pressure to end six days of violence showed little immediate effect on thursday morning , an israeli military spokesman said that the air force and navy had carried out around 20 operations since midnight , hitting , among other targets , the palestinian legislative council building , the hamas-run ministry of justice , tunnels running under the gaza-egyptian border , and a hamas arms depot .
militants fired around five missiles and mortars thursday morning , including grad missiles which struck the israeli city of beersheba .
there were no reports of injuries .
israeli army ground troops from the engineering and armoured corps , meanwhile , were massing on the israel-gaza border , waiting for the order to enter the enclave .
israel radio quoted a military official as saying that the ground operation , which is believed imminent , would involve many soldiers , but would be limited in scope .

" our customers can count on reliable deliveries , " said martin weyand , chief of the bdew german utilities federation . he said germany did not rely only on pipelines through ukraine to receive russian natural gas , but also on transit via belarus .
in addition , norway , britain and the netherlands supply germany with gas from offshore fields .
he also said germany held large gas stocks . kiev urges eu mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's natural gas monopoly gazprom wants ukraine to pay more for its gas a joint statement signed by ukrainian president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko made public early thursday morning said their country had asked the eu to mediate the dispute with russia , and promised supplies to europe would continue " uninterrupted . " a spokesman for gazprom said it had cut 100 percent of supplies , or 110 million cubic meters of gas per day , meant for ukraine from 10 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- after last-ditch talks new year 's eve on a new deal for gas deliveries failed . " at the current time we have no contract for the deliveries of gas to ukraine , " sergei kupriyanov said in a televised press conference . supplies to european customers further downstream have been increased to 326 million cubic meters per day , he added . ukraine 's gas monopoly naftogaz confirmed it was observing a steady drop in gas pressure , and said it was tapping its gas reserves to make up for the difference , both to domestic and downstream customers . eu reluctant to get involved the eu , however , seemed hesitant about getting involved . speaking on czech television , the new eu head , czech prime minister mirek topolanek , said that the eu was reluctant to broker the bilateral gas dispute . " it is pretty much a russian-ukrainian dispute and it has to be solved as such , " topolanek said . " we will appeal on both parties to reach an agreement as it is not advisable to get involved in the conflict because no one is fully familiar with those contracts , " he said . limited reserves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu comes from russia limited reserves and a need to protect domestic consumers have forced ukraine to reduce flow to europe by a net 21 million cubic meters per day , said oleh dubina , chairman of the ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftohaz ukrainy . overall supplies to europe from russia on thursday were for practical purposes at normal levels , with a relatively small reduction in flow from ukraine cancelled by an increased flow through belarus . gas supply within ukraine was normal as well , according to eyewitness reports . the breakdown in talks between moscow and kiev has raised fears of a repeat of 2006 , when a similar cutoff caused gas shortages and price spikes in western europe .
gazprom blamed ukrainian siphoning off of gas at the time . tymoshenko reassured eu commission president jose manuel barroso on wednesday that gas transit would continue uninterrupted , but gazprom accused naftogaz of " blackmailing " it with threats in talks to seize transits to europe . over 80 percent of russian gas exports to europe pass through ukrainian pipelines . tough negotiations negotiating positions between the two countries on a new gas contract were still far apart on wednesday evening .
ukraine rejected a russian offer for deliveries at $ 250 -lrb- 179 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters without a change to gas shipment tariffs charged by ukraine for on-shipment to europe . the yushchenko-tymoshenko statement , however , said ukraine could accept a maximum price of $ 201 dollars for russian gas and a minimum 15-percent hike in transit fees . russian prime minister vladimir putin on wednesday called russia 's position " very favorable " for ukraine , and declared the 250 dollar rate the kremlin 's final offer . naftogaz and gazprom officials on thursday traded accusations of breaking off talks , blaming their opposites for the wednesday end to negotiations .

despite the economic crisis , germany 's federal employment agency does n't anticipate an increase in the number of long-term unemployed people in 2009 .
one of the reasons : steady demand for skilled workers . according to the head of the employment agency , frank-juergen weise , there is still healthy demand for skilled workers in bavaria , baden-wuerttemberg , saxony and parts of thuringia - and that , he said , prevents him from sharing the general pessimism about the current economic development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-juergen weise if the fiscal crisis does n't result in a shortage of capital , then there 's a good chance that german small and medium-sized companies will have enough orders to prevent job cuts , the employment expert said .
but he emphasized that his prognosis was based on the assumption that the crisis wo n't extend beyond 18 months .
weise also expressed hope that the number of unemployed youth could be held in check thanks in part to initiatives encouraging young people to get their secondary school diplomas .
he said that while overall , 2009 might not see a reduction in unemployment , the situation probably would n't get any worse .
workers to feel impact in their wallets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of unemployed germans could increase due to the economy .
the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research -lrb- rwi -rrb- , however , was more cautious in its assessment of what 2009 has in store .
experts there are predicting a recession-related increase in the number of unemployed of almost 600,000 .
rwi president christoph schmidt said that workers would feel the impact of worsening conditions on the labor market in their wallets next year .
he said companies would only manage to avoid job cuts if they are able to reduce operating costs elsewhere .
many of germany 's top companies have offered job guarantees in 2009 - a move that creates confidence , said juergen thumann , the president of the federation of german industry -lrb- bdi -rrb- .
but this still does n't address a key aspect of germany 's persistent unemployment problem - the high rate of long-term unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved education in the secondary school can help reduce youth unemployment to combat this problem , federal employment agency head weise says the government must continue to focus on education .
some 62 percent of people who 've gone longer than a year without work either have no diploma , or a general education certificate from a hauptschule - the lowest-ranked form of secondary school in germany 's three-tier education system .
weise says that the current focus and investment in youth employment is reflected in the fact that people under the age of 25 now make up only 2 percent of long-term unemployed .
" the state has invested a tremendous amount , " he said .
in november 2008 , some 965,000 people had been jobless for over a year .
that was 20 percent less than in 2007 , but still a high 36 percent of all unemployed , he said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 01.01.2009 german organizations help youth fight pull of extreme right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks by rightwing extremists are on the rise in germany new figures show that extreme right-wing crime has increased by almost a third in germany in the past year .
a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .
“ for some young people that 's exciting , “ broden said .
the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .
violent attacks were up , as were incidents of anti-semitism .
these figures are proof that there 's still a long way to go before the efforts of martin schneider , anne broden and their colleagues are reflected in the annual statistics . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a program in one part of germany is trying to stop the far right ideology from spreading among the young . the recent attempted murder of the passau police chief , alois mannichl , by an alleged neo-nazi has once again pushed the topic of the radical right back into focus .
the assault has renewed calls for a crackdown on the neo-nazi scene , including banning the far-right national democratic party .
one thing fuelling the revived interest is the internet .
martin schneider , an 18-year-old who is involved with an initiative in cologne called “ students against rightwing extremism , ” said he believes the internet makes it particularly easy for far-right groups to build contacts with young people , for example through social networking sites such as facebook or the video site youtube .
“ nearly everyone can create a website , while covering up their own tracks , " he said . " it 's very easy to promote things which can not be checked . "
thrill factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet has opened up a whole new world for rightwing groups another lure of the websites is the sense of camaraderie the teenagers get through the campaigns and shared jokes , said anne broden , who has been the head of an anti-racism center in dusseldorf for the past 10 years .
she said that many teenagers visit these sites because it helps them find friends .
there is also a heightened thrill and fun factor , broden added .
right-wing groups organize secret concerts and reveal the time and place at the last moment via text message .
“ for some young people that 's exciting , “ broden said .
the new right-wing look bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional items of clothing like combat boots have fallen out of favor among rightwing youth another thing that has changed is the right-wing image , broden said .
one no longer sees young men in combat boots and bomber jackets .
these days , there is more effort to blend in with everyday society , or to take over and re-interpret symbols traditionally used by the left .
a perfect example of this are che guevara t-shirts .
young people with right wing affiliations can relate to the south american freedom fighter , who was willing to fight to the death for his ideas , even though they had absolutely nothing to do with the extreme right ideology .
fighting back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most right wing music has been banned in germany , but can esaily be found on the internet to combat the pull of the extreme right , broden and her colleagues recently created a network directed towards the parents and guardians of young people who have fallen into the right-wing scene .
they offer the services of 70 social workers , teachers and psychologists from children 's services , information centers and schools .
to protect those involved , there is no public list of participants in the network , because hate e-mails and violent phone calls are n't uncommon for those helping young people get away from extremist groups .
programs like broden 's work to prevent young people from becoming involved in neo-nazi groups . but once they are sucked in , it 's difficult to disengage from the scene , said winrich granitzka , a former police chief in cologne .
he added that it 's easy to get in , but it 's hard to get out , because there are emotional and sometimes financial ties .
attacks on the rise right-wing extremism is stronger in the eastern part of germany , which is still struggling to catch up with the rest of the country , in terms of jobs and other opportunities .
it 's conditions like these which add fuel to the flames , and there are fears that increased unemployment as a result of the economic crisis could fan those flames even further .
in the past year , the german interior ministry recorded almost 12,000 far-right incidents , a 30 percent increase from the year before .
violent attacks were up , as were incidents of anti-semitism .
these figures are proof that there 's still a long way to go before the efforts of martin schneider , anne broden and their colleagues are reflected in the annual statistics . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the prime minister 's traditional new year message he insisted britain would pull through - but he admitted the challenge was " enormous " .
the pm tried to strike an optimistic note , saying the british people and the government had shown their ability to meet similar challenges in the past .
but shadow chancellor george osborne accused mr brown of " arrogance " .
he said in a statement : " gordon brown is living in a fantasy land of his own imagination - not the britain of 2009 .
" he talks of tomorrow , but ignores the role he played in creating the mess of today . "
the prime minister said 2009 should be about preparing jobs and infrastructure for the future .
" this coming year wo n't be easy , but i am determined that this government will be the rock of stability and fairness on which the british people can depend , " he said .
" the scale of the challenges we face is matched by the strength of my optimism that the british people can and will rise to meet them .
" because we 're not a do nothing people and we 've always risen to every challenge , we can meet the security challenge , the environmental challenge and the enormous economic challenge . "
" today the issues may be difference , more complex , more global " gordon brown clegg warns of ' difficult ' 2009 cameron urges ' positive vision ' the pm said the task for 2009 is to " build tomorrow " , with jobs for the digital age and the green agenda , new transport and communications infrastructure and enhanced skills .
he said that by working with britain 's world partners , such actions would ensure the uk would " hit the ground running " after the downturn .
" today the issues may be difference , more complex , more global , " he said .
" and yet the qualities that are needed to meet them have been demonstrated in abundance by the british people before . "
mr brown also set out his ambition to see a new economic philosophy replace the " unbridled free market dogma " which has been discredited by the financial crisis .
" i want 2009 to be the year when the dawn of a new progressive era breaks across the world , " he said .
' swift and decisive ' that would mean governments investing through economic lows and offering " real help " to families and businesses when they were most in need .
in what could be seen as an attack on the conservatives , he insisted failure to act would lead to a worse downturn and a weaker economy in the future . "
he offers no apology for leading britain from boom into bust " shadow chancellor george osborne mr brown portrayed the government 's response to the autumn banking crisis - such as the recapitalisation of high street banks - as a " decisive " strategy to quell people 's fears .
" the scale and speed of the global financial crisis was , at times , almost overwhelming .
i know that people felt bewildered , confused and sometimes frightened , " he said .
" that is why the response had to be swift and decisive . "
he insisted that his " guiding principle " was the wellbeing of british families and businesses and added : " what keeps me up at night , and gets me up in the morning , are the hopes and aspirations of the british people . "
mr osborne attacked the prime minister , blaming him for the problems facing the country in 2009 .
" he offers no apology for leading britain from boom into bust , no explanation of why our country is now the worst affected in europe , no excuse for why six months of policy announcements have achieved nothing except to add to our national debt , " the shadow chancellor said .
" he has the arrogance to use churchillian language when he will go down in history as the politician who spent 10 years in high office failing to prepare britain for the gathering storm .
" the only thing he hardly dares talk about is change , because he knows one of things the british people want to see in 2009 is a change of government . "

" the scale of the challenges we face is matched by the strength of my optimism that the british people can and will rise to meet them .

" he offers no apology for leading britain from boom into bust , no explanation of why our country is now the worst affected in europe , no excuse for why six months of policy announcements have achieved nothing except to add to our national debt , " the shadow chancellor said .

a working group has reported back to the highways agency saying the proposal for the tolls is feasible in principle .
legislation would need to change , but operator severn river crossing says it wants to improve the service .
the situation has turned into such a talking point that it became a joke on the bbc 's hit anglo-welsh comedy series gavin and stacey .
news of the potential change has emerged as tolls undergo their annual rise on both crossings from new year 's day , with cars paying £ 5.40 , a 10p rise .
small goods vehicles and small buses will pay £ 10.90 , a 30p rise , while buses and heavy goods vehicles pay £ 16.30 , an extra 40p . "
we 're keen , as i know the highways agency are , to improve the service to motorists using the crossing " jim clune , severn river crossing however , the highways agency said the new prices reflected the reduction in the rate of vat and had been set below the level of annual inflation .
src general manager jim clune said it was difficult to say when credit and debit cards may be accepted but he hoped it would be within a year or two .
" we 're hoping it will happen but it 's early stages yet , " he said .
" we would certainly like to see it in that timescale -lsb- a year or two -rsb- and the customers would like that too .
" we 're keen , as i know the highways agency are , to improve the service to motorists using the crossing . "
mr clune said before cards could be introduced , the legislation governing the crossings would need to be amended .
" they -lsb- the highways agency -rsb- would have to change the legislation because the severn bridges act 1992 does n't permit payment by cards .
contractual issues " i know they 're working on it and are fairly determined that it should happen . "
a working group was set up in november 2007 to look at the possibility of introducing card payments on both bridges .
the working group , featuring representatives from the highways agency , src , the welsh assembly government and the uk government , presented its findings in early october to the highways agency .
" it established that , in principle , it is feasible to accept credit and debit cards as a method of toll payment at severn crossings , " said a highways agency spokesperson .
" a number of detailed operational , technical , financial and contractual issues need to be considered for the project to move forward . "
discussions are also taking place with banks and equipment suppliers , but the spokesperson could not confirm when card payments could start .
the bbc 's gavin and stacey , about the love affair between an essex boy and a barry girl , has highlighted the anomaly by having gavin complain that he has to use cash every time he crosses the bridge .
his mother pam protests : " do n't they take card ?
everyone takes card ! "
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said it had no " legal footing " in how bridge tolls were set or operated as it was a matter for the highways agency , but it did support card payments .
the rac said it would also welcome card payments on the bridges but added that traffic flows should not be disrupted .
the bridges are due to become state owned once src has collected a figure thought to be about £ 1bn , a target not expected to be met until 2016 .
in theory , tolls could then be scrapped .
former welsh liberal democrat leader mike german has complained that motorists had already paid for the second severn crossing twice over .
john mcgoldrick from the national alliance against tolls said the proposal for allowing the use of credit and debit cards on the bridges " misses the main point " .
" whether drivers pay by cash or card , the tolls cause delays as drivers still have to slow down and fumble to find the cash or a card . "

heritage minister alun ffred jones said it was an opportunity to enhance the experience for visitors to wales .
the extra funding , announced on thursday , is part of the £ 350m package from the strategic capital investment fund -lrb- scif -rrb- unveiled last month .
the welsh cultural heritage initiative will be administered by cadw , the assembly government 's historic environment service which is celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2009 .

our history will not always be a comfortable story heritage minister alun ffred jones archaeologist neil johnstone from the institute of field archaeologists welcomed the funding .
" in the context of the current financial climate , it 's a huge boost to heritage in wales , " he said .

" some of the sites stand out for their significance in terms of welsh culture and history .
it 's a good list , it 's a good selection . "
mr jones also congratulated cadw on its anniversary and said he was looking forward to a full year of activities " to celebrate the rich diversity of wales ' historic environment " .
he said : " cadw plays a crucial role in telling the story of our history and we as a nation need to feel proud of our built heritage and embrace it .

the welsh assembly government has earmarked £ 2m to conserve the sites and make them safe and accessible .
among the historic destinations which will benefit are deganwy and nevern castles , owain glyndwr 's manor sycharth and abergwyngregyn in gwynedd .
heritage minister alun ffred jones said it was an opportunity to enhance the experience for visitors to wales .
the extra funding , announced on thursday , is part of the £ 350m package from the strategic capital investment fund -lrb- scif -rrb- unveiled last month .
the welsh cultural heritage initiative will be administered by cadw , the assembly government 's historic environment service which is celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2009 .
sites already earmarked glyndyfrdwy - owain glyndwr 's motte - in denbighshire sycharth - owain glyndwr 's manor in powys nevern castle in pembrokeshire deganwy castle in conwy pennal on gwynedd , associated with owain glyndwr 's pennal letters strata florida , the ruins of a cistercian abbey in powys abergwyngregyn on the north coast of gwynedd which was the court of llewelyn the last .
so far , seven sites which will benefit from the programme of works have been announced and cadw is in discussions with other owners .
mr jones said mainly smaller sites which may find it difficult to attract public subsidy had been chosen .
" they are significantly important in the history of wales , and we also need to make them places that are more accessible to people and to give people more information about their historical significance , " he said .
the minister said he believed it was proper use of the funding .
" it is because i think it is an opportunity for us to enhance the experience of people who come here to wales , " he said .
" it 's part of the heritage tourism programme and also i think its an opportunity for us to learn more about our own history , promote some of these lesser-known sites , but sites which were very very important in their day and important to an understanding of the history of wales . "
" our history will not always be a comfortable story " heritage minister alun ffred jones archaeologist neil johnstone from the institute of field archaeologists welcomed the funding .
" in the context of the current financial climate , it 's a huge boost to heritage in wales , " he said .
" we 're struggling of course to deliver projects on the basis of the lottery funding being cut back so to have this additional funding is very welcome .
" some of the sites stand out for their significance in terms of welsh culture and history .
it 's a good list , it 's a good selection . "
mr jones also congratulated cadw on its anniversary and said he was looking forward to a full year of activities " to celebrate the rich diversity of wales ' historic environment " .
he said : " cadw plays a crucial role in telling the story of our history and we as a nation need to feel proud of our built heritage and embrace it .
" our history will not always be a comfortable story .
we have to remember our castles were n't planned and built as tourism attractions - they have a real story behind them , a story we should all be familiar with and proud of . "
