but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .
on the other hand , baudenbacher says that , so long after the war , the germans are finally at a point where they feel as if they should n't have to walk around in " sackcloth and ashes . "
switzerland tops the emigration list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans see switzerland as their dream destination of course no matter who is wrong and who is right , this is n't a topic that 's going to go away , even if both sides own up and apologize to one another .
according to the german foreign ministry , switzerland is the number one destination for germans looking to emigrate .
during 2007 , 23,000 germans packed up and headed south - that 's 9,000 more than went to the second most popular destination , the united states .
to date there are roughly 220,000 germans living in switzerland , the majority of whom hold well-paying , respectable jobs as doctors , lawyers and engineers .
baudenbauch believes that , as a general rule , the germans working and living in switzerland are happy , and do n't share the opinions of either steinbrueck or mueller . mrm / jp / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .

luxembourg premier jean-claude juncker , head of the informal group of countries which use the euro , said the move was meant " to show our partners in central and eastern europe that the eu as a whole is ready for solidarity whenever solidarity would be needed . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 swiss ready to talk taxes after trading insults with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight was triggered by debate over banking secrecy laws in switzerland switzerland is hoping to smooth over relations with germany after two politicians recently exchanged insults .
but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu rebuffs pressure to bolster stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone agrees : europe 's economic recovery program is large enough european union leaders rejected calls by the us to increase the size of their economic recovery plan as part of international efforts to avert a global recession .
instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .
while not signalling out europe specifically , the imf warned that responses to the crisis were still in " an early stage " and that " measures are still needed to restore financial stability . mik / jp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .
while not signalling out europe specifically , the imf warned that responses to the crisis were still in " an early stage " and that " measures are still needed to restore financial stability . mik / jp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 20.03.2009 obama offers iran new chapter in diplomatic engagement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could obama 's message mark a new dawn ?
us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .

it marks the first time in modern-day germany that bank shareholders face possible expropriation - which would happen if they were to block the state 's planned bailout steps - and could mark the start of germany 's first bank nationalization since the 1930s .
exhausting the alternatives berlin has provided the bank with 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 137 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it ran into difficulties in october 2008 , with social democrat finance minister peer steinbrueck insisting the bank must be saved because of its importance to the german system .
he says the bill is solely targeted at hypo real estate to give the government an option if it fails to secure a controlling majority in the bank , which it believes is necessary to restructure the lender .
it wants to get a controlling stake of over 90 percent in the bank .

" this step is the necessary answer from the government to the financial crisis . "
however , the government stressed that munich-based hypo real estate would only be nationalized for a limited period of time if all other attempts by the state to take control have been exhausted .
the legislation stipulates that the government , which plans a capital increase in the bank , must first try alternatives to expropriation such as seeking agreement from shareholders to part with stock or their participation in a capital injection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 swiss ready to talk taxes after trading insults with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight was triggered by debate over banking secrecy laws in switzerland switzerland is hoping to smooth over relations with germany after two politicians recently exchanged insults .
but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .

in a draw that bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann calls " quite exceptional , " his team is set to play barcelona for a spot in the semi-finals of the champions league .
the uefa cup draw was also set . " that is one tough draw , " klinsmann said after the match-up was determined on friday , march 20 at the uefa headquarters in nyon , switzerland . but rather than focus on the looming task at hand of defeating barcelona , klinsmann was positive , saying it would be a " great incentive " for the team to " measure itself against the best european team at the moment . "
klinsmann himself was a bayern munich striker in 1996 when the germans defeated barca in the uefa cup semifinals . munich can also take comfort in the fact that it has not lost in all four previous matches against barcelona , which is coached by josep guardiola , in europe . but despite these upbeat statistics , bayern munich team manager uli hoeness conceded the " great record " of the spanish team , which is the winner of the 2006 champions league and one of the title favorites .

" barcelona at the allianz arena in the return -lrb- on april 14 -rrb- is a dream come true for our fans . " the quarter-final tie will be an emotional affair for bayern captain mark van bommel , a champions league winner with barcelona in 2006 . " it 's a very special game for me , " he said . should bayern munich win against barcelona , they would meet either liverpool or chelsea in the semifinal . bayern last triumphed in the champions league competition in 2001 .
the other games will feature liverpool vs. chelsea , defending champion manchester united against porto and arsenal london vs. villareal . hamburg draws manchester city in uefa cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg made its way to the quarter-finals by defeating galatasaray the uefa cup draw also conducted on friday in nyon will pit manchester city , the only premier league club remaining in the uefa cup , against sv hamburg in a quarterfinal clash .
hamburg advanced to the quarterfinals thanks to a 3-2 win in istanbul over galatasaray . werder bremen , the other remaining german team in the competition will face udinese , serie a 's only remaining club . depending on the quarterfinal outcomes , there could be an all-french , all-german or all-ukrainian semifinal .

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

leaders also agreed on a plan to improve energy and high-speed internet connections . european union leaders on friday , march 20 , agreed to provide the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- with 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- in loans at the close of the regular two-day spring summit .
according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .

this decision marks the second time in three months that the eu has decided to double the facility .
hungary , latvia and romania have already requested some 16 billion euros from the fund to save their currencies , but politicians at the summit said the move to double the fund again was not based on an expectation that more countries would follow suit .
luxembourg premier jean-claude juncker , head of the informal group of countries which use the euro , said the move was meant " to show our partners in central and eastern europe that the eu as a whole is ready for solidarity whenever solidarity would be needed . "
he added that he did n't " think that this credit line will be consumed . " juncker refuted reports that the european central bank was establishing a similar fund to keep crisis-stricken euro users like ireland , malta and greece from default .

they put off a decision on whether to invite belarusian president alexander lukashenko , who is widely termed " europe 's last dictator . "

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters . " unlimited sanctions which still continue and have been renewed by the united states are wrong and need to be reviewed , " he said . jp / mik / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu rebuffs pressure to bolster stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone agrees : europe 's economic recovery program is large enough european union leaders rejected calls by the us to increase the size of their economic recovery plan as part of international efforts to avert a global recession .
instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .

" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .

europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .
while not signalling out europe specifically , the imf warned that responses to the crisis were still in " an early stage " and that " measures are still needed to restore financial stability . mik / jp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu pledges 75 billion euros to boost imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit has wrapped up with another monetary pledge an eu summit has concluded with the band of 27 european nations pledging more financial measures in the face of the economic crisis .
leaders also agreed on a plan to improve energy and high-speed internet connections . european union leaders on friday , march 20 , agreed to provide the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- with 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- in loans at the close of the regular two-day spring summit .
according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .
" the decisions that we have made today , and the extra money that is being released , will help ensure that we do everything in our power to return the global economy to growth at the quickest possible opportunity , " british prime minister gordon brown said .
saving endangered currencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says the eu is showing its non-eurozone members solidarity in addition to the imf pledge , eu members also worked out a plan to prevent eu countries without the euro as their currency from falling into further financial peril .
the eu 's top leaders agreed to double to 50 billion euros the credit limit on a fund designed to bail out such countries if their currency is on the brink of collapse .
this decision marks the second time in three months that the eu has decided to double the facility .
hungary , latvia and romania have already requested some 16 billion euros from the fund to save their currencies , but politicians at the summit said the move to double the fund again was not based on an expectation that more countries would follow suit .
luxembourg premier jean-claude juncker , head of the informal group of countries which use the euro , said the move was meant " to show our partners in central and eastern europe that the eu as a whole is ready for solidarity whenever solidarity would be needed . "
he added that he did n't " think that this credit line will be consumed . " juncker refuted reports that the european central bank was establishing a similar fund to keep crisis-stricken euro users like ireland , malta and greece from default .
agreement on energy projects , new partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders did n't make a decision about lukashenko leaders also managed to agree on a long-debated scheme to put 5 billion euros from the eu budget towards projects to improve energy and high-speed internet connections .
the " nabucco " gas pipeline from azerbaijan to austria , in what czech deputy minister alexandervondra , who brokered the compromise , called a " clear reaction " to the crisis caused by january 's russia-ukraine gas dispute , was one of the top projects agreed upon .
the eu leaders also approved the may launch of a new partnership with the eu 's former-soviet neighbors , armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine .
they put off a decision on whether to invite belarusian president alexander lukashenko , who is widely termed " europe 's last dictator . "
eu leaders also planned for the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london on april 2 and agreed to focus an upcoming summit with us president barack obama on april 4 on energy security , climate change and relations with the middle east , the south caucasus and iran . ls / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .
on the other hand , baudenbacher says that , so long after the war , the germans are finally at a point where they feel as if they should n't have to walk around in " sackcloth and ashes . "
switzerland tops the emigration list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans see switzerland as their dream destination of course no matter who is wrong and who is right , this is n't a topic that 's going to go away , even if both sides own up and apologize to one another .

to date there are roughly 220,000 germans living in switzerland , the majority of whom hold well-paying , respectable jobs as doctors , lawyers and engineers .

it marks the first time in modern-day germany that bank shareholders face possible expropriation - which would happen if they were to block the state 's planned bailout steps - and could mark the start of germany 's first bank nationalization since the 1930s .
exhausting the alternatives berlin has provided the bank with 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 137 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it ran into difficulties in october 2008 , with social democrat finance minister peer steinbrueck insisting the bank must be saved because of its importance to the german system .

hypo 's biggest investor is christopher flowers , who holds a stake of roughly 24 percent . berlin has so far failed to persuade flowers , head of new york-based investment firm j.c. flowers & co . , to sell his shares at market rates before it goes ahead with a capital increase .
he insists that he sees long-term prospects of recovery for the stock and has said he wants to keep his investment in the bank and would prefer the german government to take a 75 percent plus-one-share stake .
the stock has fallen 95 percent since september and treaded at 83 eurocents at 9:15 a.m. in frankfurt , reported bloomberg friday .
analysts have said that the bank may need as much as 10 billion euros in fresh capital to help it meet minimum capital reserve requirements .
the legislation now has to be approved by the bundesrat , the upper house , before it can become law .
the vote is scheduled for april .

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .
on the other hand , baudenbacher says that , so long after the war , the germans are finally at a point where they feel as if they should n't have to walk around in " sackcloth and ashes . "
switzerland tops the emigration list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans see switzerland as their dream destination of course no matter who is wrong and who is right , this is n't a topic that 's going to go away , even if both sides own up and apologize to one another .
according to the german foreign ministry , switzerland is the number one destination for germans looking to emigrate .
during 2007 , 23,000 germans packed up and headed south - that 's 9,000 more than went to the second most popular destination , the united states .
to date there are roughly 220,000 germans living in switzerland , the majority of whom hold well-paying , respectable jobs as doctors , lawyers and engineers .

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters . " unlimited sanctions which still continue and have been renewed by the united states are wrong and need to be reviewed , " he said . jp / mik / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu pledges 75 billion euros to boost imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit has wrapped up with another monetary pledge an eu summit has concluded with the band of 27 european nations pledging more financial measures in the face of the economic crisis .
leaders also agreed on a plan to improve energy and high-speed internet connections . european union leaders on friday , march 20 , agreed to provide the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- with 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- in loans at the close of the regular two-day spring summit .
according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .
" the decisions that we have made today , and the extra money that is being released , will help ensure that we do everything in our power to return the global economy to growth at the quickest possible opportunity , " british prime minister gordon brown said .
saving endangered currencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says the eu is showing its non-eurozone members solidarity in addition to the imf pledge , eu members also worked out a plan to prevent eu countries without the euro as their currency from falling into further financial peril .
the eu 's top leaders agreed to double to 50 billion euros the credit limit on a fund designed to bail out such countries if their currency is on the brink of collapse .
this decision marks the second time in three months that the eu has decided to double the facility .
hungary , latvia and romania have already requested some 16 billion euros from the fund to save their currencies , but politicians at the summit said the move to double the fund again was not based on an expectation that more countries would follow suit .
luxembourg premier jean-claude juncker , head of the informal group of countries which use the euro , said the move was meant " to show our partners in central and eastern europe that the eu as a whole is ready for solidarity whenever solidarity would be needed . "
he added that he did n't " think that this credit line will be consumed . " juncker refuted reports that the european central bank was establishing a similar fund to keep crisis-stricken euro users like ireland , malta and greece from default .
agreement on energy projects , new partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders did n't make a decision about lukashenko leaders also managed to agree on a long-debated scheme to put 5 billion euros from the eu budget towards projects to improve energy and high-speed internet connections .
the " nabucco " gas pipeline from azerbaijan to austria , in what czech deputy minister alexandervondra , who brokered the compromise , called a " clear reaction " to the crisis caused by january 's russia-ukraine gas dispute , was one of the top projects agreed upon .
the eu leaders also approved the may launch of a new partnership with the eu 's former-soviet neighbors , armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine .
they put off a decision on whether to invite belarusian president alexander lukashenko , who is widely termed " europe 's last dictator . "
eu leaders also planned for the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london on april 2 and agreed to focus an upcoming summit with us president barack obama on april 4 on energy security , climate change and relations with the middle east , the south caucasus and iran . ls / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .

" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .
while not signalling out europe specifically , the imf warned that responses to the crisis were still in " an early stage " and that " measures are still needed to restore financial stability . mik / jp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .
on the other hand , baudenbacher says that , so long after the war , the germans are finally at a point where they feel as if they should n't have to walk around in " sackcloth and ashes . "
switzerland tops the emigration list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans see switzerland as their dream destination of course no matter who is wrong and who is right , this is n't a topic that 's going to go away , even if both sides own up and apologize to one another .
according to the german foreign ministry , switzerland is the number one destination for germans looking to emigrate .
during 2007 , 23,000 germans packed up and headed south - that 's 9,000 more than went to the second most popular destination , the united states .
to date there are roughly 220,000 germans living in switzerland , the majority of whom hold well-paying , respectable jobs as doctors , lawyers and engineers .
baudenbauch believes that , as a general rule , the germans working and living in switzerland are happy , and do n't share the opinions of either steinbrueck or mueller . mrm / jp / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 swiss ready to talk taxes after trading insults with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight was triggered by debate over banking secrecy laws in switzerland switzerland is hoping to smooth over relations with germany after two politicians recently exchanged insults .
but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .
on the other hand , baudenbacher says that , so long after the war , the germans are finally at a point where they feel as if they should n't have to walk around in " sackcloth and ashes . "
switzerland tops the emigration list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans see switzerland as their dream destination of course no matter who is wrong and who is right , this is n't a topic that 's going to go away , even if both sides own up and apologize to one another .
according to the german foreign ministry , switzerland is the number one destination for germans looking to emigrate .
during 2007 , 23,000 germans packed up and headed south - that 's 9,000 more than went to the second most popular destination , the united states .
to date there are roughly 220,000 germans living in switzerland , the majority of whom hold well-paying , respectable jobs as doctors , lawyers and engineers .
baudenbauch believes that , as a general rule , the germans working and living in switzerland are happy , and do n't share the opinions of either steinbrueck or mueller . mrm / jp / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .
on the other hand , baudenbacher says that , so long after the war , the germans are finally at a point where they feel as if they should n't have to walk around in " sackcloth and ashes . "
switzerland tops the emigration list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans see switzerland as their dream destination of course no matter who is wrong and who is right , this is n't a topic that 's going to go away , even if both sides own up and apologize to one another .
according to the german foreign ministry , switzerland is the number one destination for germans looking to emigrate .
during 2007 , 23,000 germans packed up and headed south - that 's 9,000 more than went to the second most popular destination , the united states .
to date there are roughly 220,000 germans living in switzerland , the majority of whom hold well-paying , respectable jobs as doctors , lawyers and engineers .
baudenbauch believes that , as a general rule , the germans working and living in switzerland are happy , and do n't share the opinions of either steinbrueck or mueller . mrm / jp / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it marks the first time in modern-day germany that bank shareholders face possible expropriation - which would happen if they were to block the state 's planned bailout steps - and could mark the start of germany 's first bank nationalization since the 1930s .
exhausting the alternatives berlin has provided the bank with 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 137 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it ran into difficulties in october 2008 , with social democrat finance minister peer steinbrueck insisting the bank must be saved because of its importance to the german system .
he says the bill is solely targeted at hypo real estate to give the government an option if it fails to secure a controlling majority in the bank , which it believes is necessary to restructure the lender .
it wants to get a controlling stake of over 90 percent in the bank .
" bank rescue keeps us from chaos , " cdu budget spokesman steffen kampeter told lawmakers friday .
" this step is the necessary answer from the government to the financial crisis . "
however , the government stressed that munich-based hypo real estate would only be nationalized for a limited period of time if all other attempts by the state to take control have been exhausted .

exhausting the alternatives berlin has provided the bank with 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 137 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it ran into difficulties in october 2008 , with social democrat finance minister peer steinbrueck insisting the bank must be saved because of its importance to the german system .
he says the bill is solely targeted at hypo real estate to give the government an option if it fails to secure a controlling majority in the bank , which it believes is necessary to restructure the lender .
it wants to get a controlling stake of over 90 percent in the bank .
" bank rescue keeps us from chaos , " cdu budget spokesman steffen kampeter told lawmakers friday .
" this step is the necessary answer from the government to the financial crisis . "
however , the government stressed that munich-based hypo real estate would only be nationalized for a limited period of time if all other attempts by the state to take control have been exhausted .
the legislation stipulates that the government , which plans a capital increase in the bank , must first try alternatives to expropriation such as seeking agreement from shareholders to part with stock or their participation in a capital injection .
flowers reluctant to sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can christopher flowers be persuaded to sell his stake ?
hypo 's biggest investor is christopher flowers , who holds a stake of roughly 24 percent . berlin has so far failed to persuade flowers , head of new york-based investment firm j.c. flowers & co . , to sell his shares at market rates before it goes ahead with a capital increase .
he insists that he sees long-term prospects of recovery for the stock and has said he wants to keep his investment in the bank and would prefer the german government to take a 75 percent plus-one-share stake .
the stock has fallen 95 percent since september and treaded at 83 eurocents at 9:15 a.m. in frankfurt , reported bloomberg friday .
analysts have said that the bank may need as much as 10 billion euros in fresh capital to help it meet minimum capital reserve requirements .
the legislation now has to be approved by the bundesrat , the upper house , before it can become law .
the vote is scheduled for april .

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

leaders also agreed on a plan to improve energy and high-speed internet connections . european union leaders on friday , march 20 , agreed to provide the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- with 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- in loans at the close of the regular two-day spring summit .
according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .
" the decisions that we have made today , and the extra money that is being released , will help ensure that we do everything in our power to return the global economy to growth at the quickest possible opportunity , " british prime minister gordon brown said .
saving endangered currencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says the eu is showing its non-eurozone members solidarity in addition to the imf pledge , eu members also worked out a plan to prevent eu countries without the euro as their currency from falling into further financial peril .
the eu 's top leaders agreed to double to 50 billion euros the credit limit on a fund designed to bail out such countries if their currency is on the brink of collapse .
this decision marks the second time in three months that the eu has decided to double the facility .
hungary , latvia and romania have already requested some 16 billion euros from the fund to save their currencies , but politicians at the summit said the move to double the fund again was not based on an expectation that more countries would follow suit .
luxembourg premier jean-claude juncker , head of the informal group of countries which use the euro , said the move was meant " to show our partners in central and eastern europe that the eu as a whole is ready for solidarity whenever solidarity would be needed . "
he added that he did n't " think that this credit line will be consumed . " juncker refuted reports that the european central bank was establishing a similar fund to keep crisis-stricken euro users like ireland , malta and greece from default .

the " nabucco " gas pipeline from azerbaijan to austria , in what czech deputy minister alexandervondra , who brokered the compromise , called a " clear reaction " to the crisis caused by january 's russia-ukraine gas dispute , was one of the top projects agreed upon .
the eu leaders also approved the may launch of a new partnership with the eu 's former-soviet neighbors , armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine .
they put off a decision on whether to invite belarusian president alexander lukashenko , who is widely termed " europe 's last dictator . "
eu leaders also planned for the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london on april 2 and agreed to focus an upcoming summit with us president barack obama on april 4 on energy security , climate change and relations with the middle east , the south caucasus and iran . ls / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

" my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters . " unlimited sanctions which still continue and have been renewed by the united states are wrong and need to be reviewed , " he said . jp / mik / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders also agreed on a plan to improve energy and high-speed internet connections . european union leaders on friday , march 20 , agreed to provide the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- with 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- in loans at the close of the regular two-day spring summit .
according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .
" the decisions that we have made today , and the extra money that is being released , will help ensure that we do everything in our power to return the global economy to growth at the quickest possible opportunity , " british prime minister gordon brown said .
saving endangered currencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says the eu is showing its non-eurozone members solidarity in addition to the imf pledge , eu members also worked out a plan to prevent eu countries without the euro as their currency from falling into further financial peril .
the eu 's top leaders agreed to double to 50 billion euros the credit limit on a fund designed to bail out such countries if their currency is on the brink of collapse .
this decision marks the second time in three months that the eu has decided to double the facility .
hungary , latvia and romania have already requested some 16 billion euros from the fund to save their currencies , but politicians at the summit said the move to double the fund again was not based on an expectation that more countries would follow suit .
luxembourg premier jean-claude juncker , head of the informal group of countries which use the euro , said the move was meant " to show our partners in central and eastern europe that the eu as a whole is ready for solidarity whenever solidarity would be needed . "
he added that he did n't " think that this credit line will be consumed . " juncker refuted reports that the european central bank was establishing a similar fund to keep crisis-stricken euro users like ireland , malta and greece from default .
agreement on energy projects , new partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders did n't make a decision about lukashenko leaders also managed to agree on a long-debated scheme to put 5 billion euros from the eu budget towards projects to improve energy and high-speed internet connections .
the " nabucco " gas pipeline from azerbaijan to austria , in what czech deputy minister alexandervondra , who brokered the compromise , called a " clear reaction " to the crisis caused by january 's russia-ukraine gas dispute , was one of the top projects agreed upon .
the eu leaders also approved the may launch of a new partnership with the eu 's former-soviet neighbors , armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine .
they put off a decision on whether to invite belarusian president alexander lukashenko , who is widely termed " europe 's last dictator . "
eu leaders also planned for the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london on april 2 and agreed to focus an upcoming summit with us president barack obama on april 4 on energy security , climate change and relations with the middle east , the south caucasus and iran . ls / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 swiss ready to talk taxes after trading insults with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight was triggered by debate over banking secrecy laws in switzerland switzerland is hoping to smooth over relations with germany after two politicians recently exchanged insults .
but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .
on the other hand , baudenbacher says that , so long after the war , the germans are finally at a point where they feel as if they should n't have to walk around in " sackcloth and ashes . "
switzerland tops the emigration list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans see switzerland as their dream destination of course no matter who is wrong and who is right , this is n't a topic that 's going to go away , even if both sides own up and apologize to one another .
according to the german foreign ministry , switzerland is the number one destination for germans looking to emigrate .
during 2007 , 23,000 germans packed up and headed south - that 's 9,000 more than went to the second most popular destination , the united states .
to date there are roughly 220,000 germans living in switzerland , the majority of whom hold well-paying , respectable jobs as doctors , lawyers and engineers .
baudenbauch believes that , as a general rule , the germans working and living in switzerland are happy , and do n't share the opinions of either steinbrueck or mueller . mrm / jp / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu pledges 75 billion euros to boost imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit has wrapped up with another monetary pledge an eu summit has concluded with the band of 27 european nations pledging more financial measures in the face of the economic crisis .
leaders also agreed on a plan to improve energy and high-speed internet connections . european union leaders on friday , march 20 , agreed to provide the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- with 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- in loans at the close of the regular two-day spring summit .
according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .
" the decisions that we have made today , and the extra money that is being released , will help ensure that we do everything in our power to return the global economy to growth at the quickest possible opportunity , " british prime minister gordon brown said .
saving endangered currencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says the eu is showing its non-eurozone members solidarity in addition to the imf pledge , eu members also worked out a plan to prevent eu countries without the euro as their currency from falling into further financial peril .
the eu 's top leaders agreed to double to 50 billion euros the credit limit on a fund designed to bail out such countries if their currency is on the brink of collapse .
this decision marks the second time in three months that the eu has decided to double the facility .
hungary , latvia and romania have already requested some 16 billion euros from the fund to save their currencies , but politicians at the summit said the move to double the fund again was not based on an expectation that more countries would follow suit .
luxembourg premier jean-claude juncker , head of the informal group of countries which use the euro , said the move was meant " to show our partners in central and eastern europe that the eu as a whole is ready for solidarity whenever solidarity would be needed . "
he added that he did n't " think that this credit line will be consumed . " juncker refuted reports that the european central bank was establishing a similar fund to keep crisis-stricken euro users like ireland , malta and greece from default .
agreement on energy projects , new partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders did n't make a decision about lukashenko leaders also managed to agree on a long-debated scheme to put 5 billion euros from the eu budget towards projects to improve energy and high-speed internet connections .
the " nabucco " gas pipeline from azerbaijan to austria , in what czech deputy minister alexandervondra , who brokered the compromise , called a " clear reaction " to the crisis caused by january 's russia-ukraine gas dispute , was one of the top projects agreed upon .
the eu leaders also approved the may launch of a new partnership with the eu 's former-soviet neighbors , armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine .
they put off a decision on whether to invite belarusian president alexander lukashenko , who is widely termed " europe 's last dictator . "
eu leaders also planned for the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london on april 2 and agreed to focus an upcoming summit with us president barack obama on april 4 on energy security , climate change and relations with the middle east , the south caucasus and iran . ls / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders also agreed on a plan to improve energy and high-speed internet connections . european union leaders on friday , march 20 , agreed to provide the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- with 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- in loans at the close of the regular two-day spring summit .
according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .
" the decisions that we have made today , and the extra money that is being released , will help ensure that we do everything in our power to return the global economy to growth at the quickest possible opportunity , " british prime minister gordon brown said .
saving endangered currencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says the eu is showing its non-eurozone members solidarity in addition to the imf pledge , eu members also worked out a plan to prevent eu countries without the euro as their currency from falling into further financial peril .
the eu 's top leaders agreed to double to 50 billion euros the credit limit on a fund designed to bail out such countries if their currency is on the brink of collapse .
this decision marks the second time in three months that the eu has decided to double the facility .
hungary , latvia and romania have already requested some 16 billion euros from the fund to save their currencies , but politicians at the summit said the move to double the fund again was not based on an expectation that more countries would follow suit .
luxembourg premier jean-claude juncker , head of the informal group of countries which use the euro , said the move was meant " to show our partners in central and eastern europe that the eu as a whole is ready for solidarity whenever solidarity would be needed . "
he added that he did n't " think that this credit line will be consumed . " juncker refuted reports that the european central bank was establishing a similar fund to keep crisis-stricken euro users like ireland , malta and greece from default .
agreement on energy projects , new partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders did n't make a decision about lukashenko leaders also managed to agree on a long-debated scheme to put 5 billion euros from the eu budget towards projects to improve energy and high-speed internet connections .
the " nabucco " gas pipeline from azerbaijan to austria , in what czech deputy minister alexandervondra , who brokered the compromise , called a " clear reaction " to the crisis caused by january 's russia-ukraine gas dispute , was one of the top projects agreed upon .
the eu leaders also approved the may launch of a new partnership with the eu 's former-soviet neighbors , armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine .
they put off a decision on whether to invite belarusian president alexander lukashenko , who is widely termed " europe 's last dictator . "
eu leaders also planned for the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london on april 2 and agreed to focus an upcoming summit with us president barack obama on april 4 on energy security , climate change and relations with the middle east , the south caucasus and iran . ls / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .

it marks the first time in modern-day germany that bank shareholders face possible expropriation - which would happen if they were to block the state 's planned bailout steps - and could mark the start of germany 's first bank nationalization since the 1930s .
exhausting the alternatives berlin has provided the bank with 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 137 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it ran into difficulties in october 2008 , with social democrat finance minister peer steinbrueck insisting the bank must be saved because of its importance to the german system .
he says the bill is solely targeted at hypo real estate to give the government an option if it fails to secure a controlling majority in the bank , which it believes is necessary to restructure the lender .
it wants to get a controlling stake of over 90 percent in the bank .
" bank rescue keeps us from chaos , " cdu budget spokesman steffen kampeter told lawmakers friday .
" this step is the necessary answer from the government to the financial crisis . "
however , the government stressed that munich-based hypo real estate would only be nationalized for a limited period of time if all other attempts by the state to take control have been exhausted .
the legislation stipulates that the government , which plans a capital increase in the bank , must first try alternatives to expropriation such as seeking agreement from shareholders to part with stock or their participation in a capital injection .

but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .
on the other hand , baudenbacher says that , so long after the war , the germans are finally at a point where they feel as if they should n't have to walk around in " sackcloth and ashes . "
switzerland tops the emigration list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans see switzerland as their dream destination of course no matter who is wrong and who is right , this is n't a topic that 's going to go away , even if both sides own up and apologize to one another .
according to the german foreign ministry , switzerland is the number one destination for germans looking to emigrate .
during 2007 , 23,000 germans packed up and headed south - that 's 9,000 more than went to the second most popular destination , the united states .
to date there are roughly 220,000 germans living in switzerland , the majority of whom hold well-paying , respectable jobs as doctors , lawyers and engineers .

" the quarter-final tie will be an emotional affair for bayern captain mark van bommel , a champions league winner with barcelona in 2006 . " it 's a very special game for me , " he said . should bayern munich win against barcelona , they would meet either liverpool or chelsea in the semifinal . bayern last triumphed in the champions league competition in 2001 .

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .

about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.03.2009 german parliament approves hypo real nationalization bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalizing hypo real estate would be a last resort the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has passed controversial legislation enabling the state to seize control of ailing commercial lender hypo real estate . widely seen as a last-ditch attempt to stabilize the german financial market , the measure was passed on friday , march 20 , by a vote of 379-107 .
it marks the first time in modern-day germany that bank shareholders face possible expropriation - which would happen if they were to block the state 's planned bailout steps - and could mark the start of germany 's first bank nationalization since the 1930s .
exhausting the alternatives berlin has provided the bank with 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 137 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it ran into difficulties in october 2008 , with social democrat finance minister peer steinbrueck insisting the bank must be saved because of its importance to the german system .
he says the bill is solely targeted at hypo real estate to give the government an option if it fails to secure a controlling majority in the bank , which it believes is necessary to restructure the lender .
it wants to get a controlling stake of over 90 percent in the bank .
" bank rescue keeps us from chaos , " cdu budget spokesman steffen kampeter told lawmakers friday .
" this step is the necessary answer from the government to the financial crisis . "
however , the government stressed that munich-based hypo real estate would only be nationalized for a limited period of time if all other attempts by the state to take control have been exhausted .
the legislation stipulates that the government , which plans a capital increase in the bank , must first try alternatives to expropriation such as seeking agreement from shareholders to part with stock or their participation in a capital injection .
flowers reluctant to sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can christopher flowers be persuaded to sell his stake ?
hypo 's biggest investor is christopher flowers , who holds a stake of roughly 24 percent . berlin has so far failed to persuade flowers , head of new york-based investment firm j.c. flowers & co . , to sell his shares at market rates before it goes ahead with a capital increase .
he insists that he sees long-term prospects of recovery for the stock and has said he wants to keep his investment in the bank and would prefer the german government to take a 75 percent plus-one-share stake .
the stock has fallen 95 percent since september and treaded at 83 eurocents at 9:15 a.m. in frankfurt , reported bloomberg friday .
analysts have said that the bank may need as much as 10 billion euros in fresh capital to help it meet minimum capital reserve requirements .
the legislation now has to be approved by the bundesrat , the upper house , before it can become law .
the vote is scheduled for april .

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.03.2009 german parliament approves hypo real nationalization bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalizing hypo real estate would be a last resort the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has passed controversial legislation enabling the state to seize control of ailing commercial lender hypo real estate . widely seen as a last-ditch attempt to stabilize the german financial market , the measure was passed on friday , march 20 , by a vote of 379-107 .
it marks the first time in modern-day germany that bank shareholders face possible expropriation - which would happen if they were to block the state 's planned bailout steps - and could mark the start of germany 's first bank nationalization since the 1930s .
exhausting the alternatives berlin has provided the bank with 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 137 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it ran into difficulties in october 2008 , with social democrat finance minister peer steinbrueck insisting the bank must be saved because of its importance to the german system .
he says the bill is solely targeted at hypo real estate to give the government an option if it fails to secure a controlling majority in the bank , which it believes is necessary to restructure the lender .
it wants to get a controlling stake of over 90 percent in the bank .
" bank rescue keeps us from chaos , " cdu budget spokesman steffen kampeter told lawmakers friday .
" this step is the necessary answer from the government to the financial crisis . "
however , the government stressed that munich-based hypo real estate would only be nationalized for a limited period of time if all other attempts by the state to take control have been exhausted .
the legislation stipulates that the government , which plans a capital increase in the bank , must first try alternatives to expropriation such as seeking agreement from shareholders to part with stock or their participation in a capital injection .
flowers reluctant to sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can christopher flowers be persuaded to sell his stake ?
hypo 's biggest investor is christopher flowers , who holds a stake of roughly 24 percent . berlin has so far failed to persuade flowers , head of new york-based investment firm j.c. flowers & co . , to sell his shares at market rates before it goes ahead with a capital increase .
he insists that he sees long-term prospects of recovery for the stock and has said he wants to keep his investment in the bank and would prefer the german government to take a 75 percent plus-one-share stake .
the stock has fallen 95 percent since september and treaded at 83 eurocents at 9:15 a.m. in frankfurt , reported bloomberg friday .
analysts have said that the bank may need as much as 10 billion euros in fresh capital to help it meet minimum capital reserve requirements .
the legislation now has to be approved by the bundesrat , the upper house , before it can become law .
the vote is scheduled for april .

instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu rebuffs pressure to bolster stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone agrees : europe 's economic recovery program is large enough european union leaders rejected calls by the us to increase the size of their economic recovery plan as part of international efforts to avert a global recession .
instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .

in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .

instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .

but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .
on the other hand , baudenbacher says that , so long after the war , the germans are finally at a point where they feel as if they should n't have to walk around in " sackcloth and ashes . "
switzerland tops the emigration list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans see switzerland as their dream destination of course no matter who is wrong and who is right , this is n't a topic that 's going to go away , even if both sides own up and apologize to one another .
according to the german foreign ministry , switzerland is the number one destination for germans looking to emigrate .
during 2007 , 23,000 germans packed up and headed south - that 's 9,000 more than went to the second most popular destination , the united states .
to date there are roughly 220,000 germans living in switzerland , the majority of whom hold well-paying , respectable jobs as doctors , lawyers and engineers .
baudenbauch believes that , as a general rule , the germans working and living in switzerland are happy , and do n't share the opinions of either steinbrueck or mueller . mrm / jp / tt / dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister skirmishes with swiss as economic outlook sinks german finance minister peer steinbrueck says he does n't know just how bad this biting recession is going to get .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 20.03.2009 obama offers iran new chapter in diplomatic engagement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could obama 's message mark a new dawn ?
us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters . " unlimited sanctions which still continue and have been renewed by the united states are wrong and need to be reviewed , " he said . jp / mik / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders also agreed on a plan to improve energy and high-speed internet connections . european union leaders on friday , march 20 , agreed to provide the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- with 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- in loans at the close of the regular two-day spring summit .
according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .
" the decisions that we have made today , and the extra money that is being released , will help ensure that we do everything in our power to return the global economy to growth at the quickest possible opportunity , " british prime minister gordon brown said .
saving endangered currencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says the eu is showing its non-eurozone members solidarity in addition to the imf pledge , eu members also worked out a plan to prevent eu countries without the euro as their currency from falling into further financial peril .
the eu 's top leaders agreed to double to 50 billion euros the credit limit on a fund designed to bail out such countries if their currency is on the brink of collapse .
this decision marks the second time in three months that the eu has decided to double the facility .
hungary , latvia and romania have already requested some 16 billion euros from the fund to save their currencies , but politicians at the summit said the move to double the fund again was not based on an expectation that more countries would follow suit .
luxembourg premier jean-claude juncker , head of the informal group of countries which use the euro , said the move was meant " to show our partners in central and eastern europe that the eu as a whole is ready for solidarity whenever solidarity would be needed . "
he added that he did n't " think that this credit line will be consumed . " juncker refuted reports that the european central bank was establishing a similar fund to keep crisis-stricken euro users like ireland , malta and greece from default .
agreement on energy projects , new partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders did n't make a decision about lukashenko leaders also managed to agree on a long-debated scheme to put 5 billion euros from the eu budget towards projects to improve energy and high-speed internet connections .

" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .
" so now they have this feeling that germany reunited and powerful again is trying to teach them a lesson , " he added .
on the other hand , baudenbacher says that , so long after the war , the germans are finally at a point where they feel as if they should n't have to walk around in " sackcloth and ashes . "
switzerland tops the emigration list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans see switzerland as their dream destination of course no matter who is wrong and who is right , this is n't a topic that 's going to go away , even if both sides own up and apologize to one another .

to date there are roughly 220,000 germans living in switzerland , the majority of whom hold well-paying , respectable jobs as doctors , lawyers and engineers .

it marks the first time in modern-day germany that bank shareholders face possible expropriation - which would happen if they were to block the state 's planned bailout steps - and could mark the start of germany 's first bank nationalization since the 1930s .
exhausting the alternatives berlin has provided the bank with 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 137 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it ran into difficulties in october 2008 , with social democrat finance minister peer steinbrueck insisting the bank must be saved because of its importance to the german system .
he says the bill is solely targeted at hypo real estate to give the government an option if it fails to secure a controlling majority in the bank , which it believes is necessary to restructure the lender .
it wants to get a controlling stake of over 90 percent in the bank .
" bank rescue keeps us from chaos , " cdu budget spokesman steffen kampeter told lawmakers friday .
" this step is the necessary answer from the government to the financial crisis . "
however , the government stressed that munich-based hypo real estate would only be nationalized for a limited period of time if all other attempts by the state to take control have been exhausted .
the legislation stipulates that the government , which plans a capital increase in the bank , must first try alternatives to expropriation such as seeking agreement from shareholders to part with stock or their participation in a capital injection .

hypo 's biggest investor is christopher flowers , who holds a stake of roughly 24 percent . berlin has so far failed to persuade flowers , head of new york-based investment firm j.c. flowers & co . , to sell his shares at market rates before it goes ahead with a capital increase .
he insists that he sees long-term prospects of recovery for the stock and has said he wants to keep his investment in the bank and would prefer the german government to take a 75 percent plus-one-share stake .
the stock has fallen 95 percent since september and treaded at 83 eurocents at 9:15 a.m. in frankfurt , reported bloomberg friday .
analysts have said that the bank may need as much as 10 billion euros in fresh capital to help it meet minimum capital reserve requirements .
the legislation now has to be approved by the bundesrat , the upper house , before it can become law .
the vote is scheduled for april .

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu rebuffs pressure to bolster stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone agrees : europe 's economic recovery program is large enough european union leaders rejected calls by the us to increase the size of their economic recovery plan as part of international efforts to avert a global recession .
instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .
while not signalling out europe specifically , the imf warned that responses to the crisis were still in " an early stage " and that " measures are still needed to restore financial stability . mik / jp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "
dire predictions by imf the eu meeting in brussels was designed to forge a common view among all 27 eu member states ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 , which will be called upon to change the rules of international finance . it came amid dire new forecasts from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , which now expects the global economy to contract by up to 1 per cent in 2009 . the imf expects a much deeper recession in the 16-member eurozone , with its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- set to shrink by 3.2 per cent this year , compared to a drop of 2.6 per cent in the united states .

according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 20.03.2009 german parliament approves hypo real nationalization bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalizing hypo real estate would be a last resort the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has passed controversial legislation enabling the state to seize control of ailing commercial lender hypo real estate . widely seen as a last-ditch attempt to stabilize the german financial market , the measure was passed on friday , march 20 , by a vote of 379-107 .
it marks the first time in modern-day germany that bank shareholders face possible expropriation - which would happen if they were to block the state 's planned bailout steps - and could mark the start of germany 's first bank nationalization since the 1930s .
exhausting the alternatives berlin has provided the bank with 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 137 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it ran into difficulties in october 2008 , with social democrat finance minister peer steinbrueck insisting the bank must be saved because of its importance to the german system .
he says the bill is solely targeted at hypo real estate to give the government an option if it fails to secure a controlling majority in the bank , which it believes is necessary to restructure the lender .
it wants to get a controlling stake of over 90 percent in the bank .
" bank rescue keeps us from chaos , " cdu budget spokesman steffen kampeter told lawmakers friday .
" this step is the necessary answer from the government to the financial crisis . "
however , the government stressed that munich-based hypo real estate would only be nationalized for a limited period of time if all other attempts by the state to take control have been exhausted .
the legislation stipulates that the government , which plans a capital increase in the bank , must first try alternatives to expropriation such as seeking agreement from shareholders to part with stock or their participation in a capital injection .
flowers reluctant to sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can christopher flowers be persuaded to sell his stake ?
hypo 's biggest investor is christopher flowers , who holds a stake of roughly 24 percent . berlin has so far failed to persuade flowers , head of new york-based investment firm j.c. flowers & co . , to sell his shares at market rates before it goes ahead with a capital increase .
he insists that he sees long-term prospects of recovery for the stock and has said he wants to keep his investment in the bank and would prefer the german government to take a 75 percent plus-one-share stake .
the stock has fallen 95 percent since september and treaded at 83 eurocents at 9:15 a.m. in frankfurt , reported bloomberg friday .
analysts have said that the bank may need as much as 10 billion euros in fresh capital to help it meet minimum capital reserve requirements .
the legislation now has to be approved by the bundesrat , the upper house , before it can become law .
the vote is scheduled for april .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 swiss ready to talk taxes after trading insults with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight was triggered by debate over banking secrecy laws in switzerland switzerland is hoping to smooth over relations with germany after two politicians recently exchanged insults .
but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .
history of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck says he 's been getting hate mail from switzerland historically there has a been a lot of tension between germany and switzerland , especially when it comes to the atrocities committed by the german national socialists during the 1930s and 40s .
another thorny issue is banking secrecy , which is deeply woven into the fabric of swiss life .
carl baudenbacher is a professor of economic law , and a swiss citizen married to a german . he has a unique perspective on the situation . baudenbacher told deutsche welle that on the swiss side there has always been a certain inferiority complex when it comes to germany , and that the swiss do n't like to be lectured by their bigger neighbor - which got even bigger after the fall of the berlin wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu rebuffs pressure to bolster stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone agrees : europe 's economic recovery program is large enough european union leaders rejected calls by the us to increase the size of their economic recovery plan as part of international efforts to avert a global recession .
instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu rebuffs pressure to bolster stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone agrees : europe 's economic recovery program is large enough european union leaders rejected calls by the us to increase the size of their economic recovery plan as part of international efforts to avert a global recession .
instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .
the agreement , reached after months of haggling , was clinched after germany received assurances that the money would have to be spent by the end of 2010 .
" i think we have reached a compromise that everyone can subscribe to , " topolanek said , with barroso noting that entire eu would benefit from the implementation of these investments . a compromise text tabled by the czech presidency earmarks a total of 2.3 billion euros for gas and electricity infrastructure projects . some 505 million euros are to be spent on offshore wind energy projects , 1.2 billion for carbon capture and storage programmes , and a further 1 billion for the spread of broadband internet in rural areas .
in addition , the european commission sought agreement from leaders to double a credit line for struggling non-eurozone members to 50 billion euros , after already doubling it to 25 billion euros in december .
" if we feel we want to give a signal of great support we could agree to double the ceiling to 50 billion euros , " barroso said .
" i hope that tomorrow this will be approved unanimously . "
the existing 25-billion-euro credit line is getting rapidly depleted after hungary and latvia drew nearly 10 billion euros from it and others starting with romania likely to follow soon .
" we are roughly in agreement on almost doubling the facility , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money talk : german chancellor angela merkel and finance minister peer steinbrück in brussels one official said that eu leaders were also " close to an agreement " to contribute $ 75 billion to a major increase in the international monetary fund 's resources for lending to an increasing number of struggling countries .
europe wants to double the resources of the imf to $ 500 billion while washington has suggested lifting its lending capacity threefold to $ 750 billion .
" we did n't yet decide but there was a very strong willingness to increase the resources of imf , " finnish prime minister matti vanhanen said .
" tomorrow i hope we can make a decision . "

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu pledges 75 billion euros to boost imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit has wrapped up with another monetary pledge an eu summit has concluded with the band of 27 european nations pledging more financial measures in the face of the economic crisis .
leaders also agreed on a plan to improve energy and high-speed internet connections . european union leaders on friday , march 20 , agreed to provide the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- with 75 billion euros -lrb- $ 101.5 billion -rrb- in loans at the close of the regular two-day spring summit .
according to czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , making such funds available will enable the imf " to react better in the context of the crisis . "
the pledge on behalf of the eu comes as part of a call to the international community to double the fund 's resources .
eu diplomats had already proposed that the bloc offer between $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion to the imf .
" the decisions that we have made today , and the extra money that is being released , will help ensure that we do everything in our power to return the global economy to growth at the quickest possible opportunity , " british prime minister gordon brown said .
saving endangered currencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says the eu is showing its non-eurozone members solidarity in addition to the imf pledge , eu members also worked out a plan to prevent eu countries without the euro as their currency from falling into further financial peril .
the eu 's top leaders agreed to double to 50 billion euros the credit limit on a fund designed to bail out such countries if their currency is on the brink of collapse .
this decision marks the second time in three months that the eu has decided to double the facility .
hungary , latvia and romania have already requested some 16 billion euros from the fund to save their currencies , but politicians at the summit said the move to double the fund again was not based on an expectation that more countries would follow suit .
luxembourg premier jean-claude juncker , head of the informal group of countries which use the euro , said the move was meant " to show our partners in central and eastern europe that the eu as a whole is ready for solidarity whenever solidarity would be needed . "
he added that he did n't " think that this credit line will be consumed . " juncker refuted reports that the european central bank was establishing a similar fund to keep crisis-stricken euro users like ireland , malta and greece from default .
agreement on energy projects , new partnership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders did n't make a decision about lukashenko leaders also managed to agree on a long-debated scheme to put 5 billion euros from the eu budget towards projects to improve energy and high-speed internet connections .
the " nabucco " gas pipeline from azerbaijan to austria , in what czech deputy minister alexandervondra , who brokered the compromise , called a " clear reaction " to the crisis caused by january 's russia-ukraine gas dispute , was one of the top projects agreed upon .
the eu leaders also approved the may launch of a new partnership with the eu 's former-soviet neighbors , armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine .
they put off a decision on whether to invite belarusian president alexander lukashenko , who is widely termed " europe 's last dictator . "
eu leaders also planned for the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- summit in london on april 2 and agreed to focus an upcoming summit with us president barack obama on april 4 on energy security , climate change and relations with the middle east , the south caucasus and iran . ls / tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us president barack obama has extended an olive branch to iran in a bid to end decades of distrust and animosity .
the eu 's foreign policy chief voiced hope the message will usher in a new era in international relations . in one of his most decisive foreign policy statements since taking in office in january , obama said in a video message with farsi subtitles released by the white house on friday , march 20 , that washington was committed to pursuing " constructive ties " with the islamic republic . " my administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us , and to pursuing constructive ties among the united states , iran and the international community , " obama said in the surprise message times to mark the start of nowruz , the iranian new year . with friendship come responsibilities although the us president did not specifically mention us allegations of iran 's support of terrorist activities or its nuclear program which washington has accused tehran of pursuing for the last several years , obama stressed that " the united states wants the islamic republic of iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations . " " you have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities , and that place can not be reached through terror or arms , but rather through peaceful actions that demonstrate the true greatness of the iranian people and civilization … .. and the measure of that greatness is not the capacity to destroy , it is your demonstrated ability to build and create . " obama 's address clearly signaled his administration 's recognition of iran as a potential negotiating partner , even though the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980 . in fact , obama has declined to take the military option off the table as a way of preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons . but by vowing to commit to renewed diplomacy with tehran , obama was following up on his campaign promise to engage with washington 's adversaries .
it also evoked his january 20 inaugural address in which he promised the muslim world he would " extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . " hoping for a sensible response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana 's attempts to negotiate with tehran are complicated by the refusal of the us to talk directly with iran the offer of direct talks and a new diplomatic start with iran is a " very good " one and deserves an " intelligent " response , said the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana in response to obama 's message . solana heads international negotiations over iran 's controversial nuclear program and is tasked with negotiating with tehran on behalf of the united nations security council 's permanent members and germany . " i hope very much that iran will react intelligently , " solana told journalists on the fringes of an eu summit in brussels . " i hope very much iran will pay good attention to what has been said by president obama .
i hope this will open a new chapter in the relations with tehran , " he said . meanwhile , a top advisor to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad welcomed the olive branch to tehran but urged obama to back his words with concrete action to repair past mistakes . " we welcome the wish of the president of the united states to put away past differences , " ahmadinejad 's press advisor ali akbar javanfekr told afp .
" but the way to do that is not by iran forgetting the previous hostile and aggressive attitude of the united states … .the american administration has to recognize its past mistakes and repair them as a way to put away the differences . " " he has to go further than words and take action .
if obama shows willingness to take action , the iranian government will not show its back to him , " stressed javanfekr . he said the differences referred to by obama are a result of the " hostile , aggressive and colonialist attitude of the american government … .the united states is mainly responsible for these differences and if it does not address them , they will remain , " he said .
" by fundamentally changing its behaviour america can offer us a friendly hand , " javanfekr told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 eu rebuffs pressure to bolster stimulus spending großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone agrees : europe 's economic recovery program is large enough european union leaders rejected calls by the us to increase the size of their economic recovery plan as part of international efforts to avert a global recession .
instead the eu will spend money on energy security . " we heard expressions from -lrb- eu leaders -rrb- like , ' we do n't wish to be dictated to by the us or by those who want more fiscal stimulus ' , " said czech prime minister mirek topolanek at an eu summit in brussels on thursday , march 19 . the eu 's economic recovery package is currently worth 3.3 per cent of the bloc 's annual gdp , spread over two years .
about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but their criticisms were rejected by eu leaders .
" all member states have adopted important stimulus programmes , " said german chancellor angela merkel . " we are getting to a point in which europe is doing everything it can , " said swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt . while expressing deep concern over the state of the global economy , reinfeldt said the large budget deficits of many eu member states meant there were " no easy solutions . "
agreement to fund projects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will invest in energy security the main concrete result of the first day of the two-day meeting in brussels was an agreement to use 5 billion euros in community funds to finance energy security and other projects designed to stimulate the economy .

about half this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn .
the package has been described as insufficient by obama 's chief economic advisor , lawrence summers , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .

it marks the first time in modern-day germany that bank shareholders face possible expropriation - which would happen if they were to block the state 's planned bailout steps - and could mark the start of germany 's first bank nationalization since the 1930s .
exhausting the alternatives berlin has provided the bank with 102 billion euros -lrb- $ 137 billion -rrb- in state guarantees since it ran into difficulties in october 2008 , with social democrat finance minister peer steinbrueck insisting the bank must be saved because of its importance to the german system .
he says the bill is solely targeted at hypo real estate to give the government an option if it fails to secure a controlling majority in the bank , which it believes is necessary to restructure the lender .
it wants to get a controlling stake of over 90 percent in the bank .
" bank rescue keeps us from chaos , " cdu budget spokesman steffen kampeter told lawmakers friday .
" this step is the necessary answer from the government to the financial crisis . "
however , the government stressed that munich-based hypo real estate would only be nationalized for a limited period of time if all other attempts by the state to take control have been exhausted .
the legislation stipulates that the government , which plans a capital increase in the bank , must first try alternatives to expropriation such as seeking agreement from shareholders to part with stock or their participation in a capital injection .

analysts have said that the bank may need as much as 10 billion euros in fresh capital to help it meet minimum capital reserve requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.03.2009 swiss ready to talk taxes after trading insults with germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight was triggered by debate over banking secrecy laws in switzerland switzerland is hoping to smooth over relations with germany after two politicians recently exchanged insults .
but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .

but tempers are fraying and things could be rough for a while . switzerland has moved to ease tensions with germany after words were exchanged this week between german finance minster peer steinbrueck and thomas mueller , a member of the swiss parliament from the christian democratic people 's party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss president struck a conciliatory tone swiss president hans-rudolf mertz said at a news conference in bern on thursday evening that the government was ready to renegotiate tax agreements despite the conflict .
" problems ca n't be solved with verbal attacks and insults , " merz said .
" for my part i never have and never will insult anybody .
it is not my style . "
steinbrueck told the daily sueddeutsche zeitung that he has been getting threatening letters from switzerland and is being " bad-mouthed as a nazi stooge " after mueller compared him to " that generation of germans … who went through the streets wearing leather coats , boots and -lrb- nazi -rrb- arm bands " on the floor of the swiss parliament .
mueller was later admonished by members of his party as well as the speaker of the lower chamber , chiara simoneschi .
mueller himself has refused to make a statement , though the german daily bild is reporting that mueller intended his remarks to be a personal attack on steinbrueck . the fight broke out after steinbrueck made a speech to the finance ministers of the g20 group of economic powers in london at the weekend in which he compared the swiss to indians running scared from the cavalry .

the michelin-starred fat duck , in bray , berkshire , was shut for more than two weeks from 24 february after 400 diners complained of having fallen ill .
blumenthal , 42 , told australia 's hospitality magazine that the cause was " categorically not food poisoning " .
he said a number of customers and staff " had tested positive for norovirus " .
norovirus , known as the " winter vomiting disease " , is the most common cause of stomach bugs in the uk .
the virus , which causes sudden vomiting and diarrhoea , is easily transmitted from one person to another by contact with an infected person or through contaminated food or drink or touching contaminated surfaces or objects .
' incredible ' support speaking to hospitality magazine after arriving in australia for the melbourne food and wine festival , mr blumenthal said : " the only thing that has come up is that three staff and five customers have tested positive for something called norovirus . "
he said support for the restaurant had been " incredible " but it had been a costly experience for the restaurant .
" it 's affected the restaurant big time because we had to cancel 800 people because of the closure but in terms of the business and people wanting to come in then no , " he said .
the celebrity chef added : " for the last five years we 've been sending food off every month for sampling and i do n't know any other restaurant in the country that does that .
" we also have a company that has been looking after all our health and safety stuff for the last five years . "
earlier this month , the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said the number of cases of reported illness among customers , going back to late january , had risen to about 400 since initial media coverage of the outbreak .
but the hpa said the restaurant was safe to re-open for business last week .
a spokeswoman for hpa 's thames valley health protection unit said : " results of some tests are still awaited and the detailed questioning of people who reported illness is likely to continue for some weeks in order to build a more complete picture . "

the michelin-starred fat duck , in bray , berkshire , was shut for more than two weeks from 24 february after 400 diners complained of having fallen ill .
blumenthal , 42 , told australia 's hospitality magazine that the cause was " categorically not food poisoning " .
he said a number of customers and staff " had tested positive for norovirus " .
norovirus , known as the " winter vomiting disease " , is the most common cause of stomach bugs in the uk .
the virus , which causes sudden vomiting and diarrhoea , is easily transmitted from one person to another by contact with an infected person or through contaminated food or drink or touching contaminated surfaces or objects .
' incredible ' support speaking to hospitality magazine after arriving in australia for the melbourne food and wine festival , mr blumenthal said : " the only thing that has come up is that three staff and five customers have tested positive for something called norovirus . "
he said support for the restaurant had been " incredible " but it had been a costly experience for the restaurant .
" it 's affected the restaurant big time because we had to cancel 800 people because of the closure but in terms of the business and people wanting to come in then no , " he said .
the celebrity chef added : " for the last five years we 've been sending food off every month for sampling and i do n't know any other restaurant in the country that does that .
" we also have a company that has been looking after all our health and safety stuff for the last five years . "
earlier this month , the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said the number of cases of reported illness among customers , going back to late january , had risen to about 400 since initial media coverage of the outbreak .
but the hpa said the restaurant was safe to re-open for business last week .

the michelin-starred fat duck , in bray , berkshire , was shut for more than two weeks from 24 february after 400 diners complained of having fallen ill .
blumenthal , 42 , told australia 's hospitality magazine that the cause was " categorically not food poisoning " .
he said a number of customers and staff " had tested positive for norovirus " .
norovirus , known as the " winter vomiting disease " , is the most common cause of stomach bugs in the uk .
the virus , which causes sudden vomiting and diarrhoea , is easily transmitted from one person to another by contact with an infected person or through contaminated food or drink or touching contaminated surfaces or objects .
' incredible ' support speaking to hospitality magazine after arriving in australia for the melbourne food and wine festival , mr blumenthal said : " the only thing that has come up is that three staff and five customers have tested positive for something called norovirus . "
he said support for the restaurant had been " incredible " but it had been a costly experience for the restaurant .
" it 's affected the restaurant big time because we had to cancel 800 people because of the closure but in terms of the business and people wanting to come in then no , " he said .
the celebrity chef added : " for the last five years we 've been sending food off every month for sampling and i do n't know any other restaurant in the country that does that .
" we also have a company that has been looking after all our health and safety stuff for the last five years . "
earlier this month , the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said the number of cases of reported illness among customers , going back to late january , had risen to about 400 since initial media coverage of the outbreak .
but the hpa said the restaurant was safe to re-open for business last week .
a spokeswoman for hpa 's thames valley health protection unit said : " results of some tests are still awaited and the detailed questioning of people who reported illness is likely to continue for some weeks in order to build a more complete picture . "

it comes after report authors into the 2005 outbreak criticised a council 's inspectors for not inspecting a butcher " as well as they should have done " .
mason jones , five , of deri , in bargoed , caerphilly county , died during the outbreak and 156 others became ill .
butcher william tudor was jailed after admitting supplying contaminated meat .
in the report from a public inquiry into the outbreak - wales ' largest - author professor hugh pennington , laid the blame for the outbreak on tudor , who supplied raw and cooked meat for schools in bridgend , rhondda cynon taf , caerphilly and merthyr tydfil .
but he also criticised bridgend council 's environmental heath officers who inspected tudor 's bridgend premises .
he said " clues were missed " and their inspections did not assess or monitor tudor 's management of food safety as well as they " could " , or " should " have done .
food hygiene rules should have been sufficient to prevent the outbreak the process by which meat supply contracts were awarded to john tudor and son in 1998 and 2002 by rhondda cynon taf , bridgend , caerphilly and merthyr tydfil councils were " seriously flawed " , the report also said .
he gave 24 recommendations for what he wants to see put in place to try to prevent an outbreak happening again .
these include additional resources to ensure that all food businesses in wales understand and implement regulations .
prof pennington had also investigated an e.coli outbreak in scotland 13 years ago , after which he recommended the sharing of information about meat suppliers .
he said it was now a matter of urgency that this was implemented .
it comes as a bbc wales week in week out investigation discovered that some councils in wales are unaware of the standard of meat being supplied to schools .
in particular , it found that the supplier of frozen meat to gwynedd council had scored " weak " for hygiene and management practices in three meat hygiene service -lrb- mhs -rrb- audits during 2008 .
but the authority were not told this as the third party auditing company it uses - the consortium - did not read the mhs reports .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
the mhs said that if a slaughterhouse or cutting plant posed an imminent risk to public health it would be closed down .
gwynedd council said it has been assured by the consortium - which spot checks the company - that it is a competent supplier of frozen meat .
however the consortium has identified some areas where improvements could be made .
and will continue closely monitoring the company .
following the investigation , the wlga called for more sharing of information about potential suppliers .
it said there was " a possible way forward " on the exchange of such information and wlga chief executive steve thomas said " some database across wales should be put in place " .
mr thomas said : " that exchange of information is absolutely key .
" it might be however that some sort of common risk register , some database across wales should be put in place and could be investigated .
" it may have data implications but could be investigated as a possible way forward to make sure that information sharing is undertaken to common standards . "

and will continue closely monitoring the company .
following the investigation , the wlga called for more sharing of information about potential suppliers .
it said there was " a possible way forward " on the exchange of such information and wlga chief executive steve thomas said " some database across wales should be put in place " .
mr thomas said : " that exchange of information is absolutely key .
" it might be however that some sort of common risk register , some database across wales should be put in place and could be investigated .
" it may have data implications but could be investigated as a possible way forward to make sure that information sharing is undertaken to common standards . "

advertisement cornwall 's hospital trust is heading for " corporate failure " and requires radical change and improvement , says a report .
the leadership of the royal cornwall hospitals ' trust -lrb- rcht -rrb- is heading " towards corporate failure " , an independent review has concluded .
the report was commissioned by the south west strategic health authority and the rcht .
the trust 's chief executive john watkinson , who is currently suspended from duty , condemned the report as " deeply flawed " .
medical director dominic byrne has now resigned in protest over it .
the news followed the healthcare commission 's conclusion that last year , for the third year running , the trust provided a " weak " quality of service to patients .
the report raises serious concerns and makes clear the rcht can not stand alone to solve its problems sir mike pitt , sw strategic health authority sir mike pitt , chair of the south west strategic health authority , said : " the report raises serious concerns ... and makes clear that the rcht can not stand alone or look to others to solve its problems . "
the rcht said it accepted the report and the 27 recommendations for improvements it made .
peter colclough , the rcht 's interim chief executive , said : " the time is right now to act on the recommendations .
" it is important to stress that the problems highlighted relate to the trust 's management ... and not to the quality of the many excellent clinical services that continue to be provided . "
the independent review , chaired by david fielding , was ordered after mr watkinson was suspended last september .
rcht report findings leadership heading " towards corporate failure " managers " over optimistic " about quality of patient service trust " off-target " to repay £ 4m government loan management falls short of expected standards management fails to follow " spirit " of nhs code of conduct his suspension followed a critical report on financial management at his former employer , bromley hospitals nhs trust -lrb- bht -rrb- in london , which had debts of £ 87m .
the cornwall report concluded : " although the chief executive is said to be charismatic , energetic and committed to patients and the cornwall nhs , his ' can do ' approach is not complemented by sufficient investment in developing basic management capacity ... across the organisation , which is patchy at best . "
but mr watkinson said in a statement the report contained " factual inaccuracies and unbalanced reporting " , highlighting that in his first full year as chief executive , the trust made a surplus of £ 1.2m.
" this contrasts with a deficit in the previous year of £ 36m , " he said .
" this is a net improvement in one year of more than £ 37m and the first time in six years that finances have not got worse year on year . "
this is disputed by the trust .
confidential discussions mr watkinson said when he was brought to cornwall , the trust was the worst-performing nhs trust in england .
" after only one full year in charge at the time of my suspension , it would be remarkable if scope for improvement did not remain , " he said .
the trust said it would discuss the report 's findings with mr watkinson confidentially .
on thursday , the rcht announced a new chairman , martin watts , would be taking over .
peter davies resigned from the post last july in protest at plans to move some cancer services from cornwall to devon .

advertisement cornwall 's hospital trust is heading for " corporate failure " and requires radical change and improvement , says a report .
the leadership of the royal cornwall hospitals ' trust -lrb- rcht -rrb- is heading " towards corporate failure " , an independent review has concluded .
the report was commissioned by the south west strategic health authority and the rcht .
the trust 's chief executive john watkinson , who is currently suspended from duty , condemned the report as " deeply flawed " .
medical director dominic byrne has now resigned in protest over it .
the news followed the healthcare commission 's conclusion that last year , for the third year running , the trust provided a " weak " quality of service to patients .
the report raises serious concerns and makes clear the rcht can not stand alone to solve its problems sir mike pitt , sw strategic health authority sir mike pitt , chair of the south west strategic health authority , said : " the report raises serious concerns ... and makes clear that the rcht can not stand alone or look to others to solve its problems . "
the rcht said it accepted the report and the 27 recommendations for improvements it made .
peter colclough , the rcht 's interim chief executive , said : " the time is right now to act on the recommendations .
" it is important to stress that the problems highlighted relate to the trust 's management ... and not to the quality of the many excellent clinical services that continue to be provided . "
the independent review , chaired by david fielding , was ordered after mr watkinson was suspended last september .
rcht report findings leadership heading " towards corporate failure " managers " over optimistic " about quality of patient service trust " off-target " to repay £ 4m government loan management falls short of expected standards management fails to follow " spirit " of nhs code of conduct his suspension followed a critical report on financial management at his former employer , bromley hospitals nhs trust -lrb- bht -rrb- in london , which had debts of £ 87m .
the cornwall report concluded : " although the chief executive is said to be charismatic , energetic and committed to patients and the cornwall nhs , his ' can do ' approach is not complemented by sufficient investment in developing basic management capacity ... across the organisation , which is patchy at best . "
but mr watkinson said in a statement the report contained " factual inaccuracies and unbalanced reporting " , highlighting that in his first full year as chief executive , the trust made a surplus of £ 1.2m.
" this contrasts with a deficit in the previous year of £ 36m , " he said .
" this is a net improvement in one year of more than £ 37m and the first time in six years that finances have not got worse year on year . "
this is disputed by the trust .
confidential discussions mr watkinson said when he was brought to cornwall , the trust was the worst-performing nhs trust in england .
" after only one full year in charge at the time of my suspension , it would be remarkable if scope for improvement did not remain , " he said .
the trust said it would discuss the report 's findings with mr watkinson confidentially .
on thursday , the rcht announced a new chairman , martin watts , would be taking over .
peter davies resigned from the post last july in protest at plans to move some cancer services from cornwall to devon .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- decline of india 's political leviathans bbc news / south asia graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 09:16 gmt , friday , 20 march 2009 decline of india 's political leviathans as india braces for another split verdict in the forthcoming general election , mahesh rangarajan analyses the decline of the country 's national parties .
india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy . "
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government " read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .

we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

india is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
neither of the premier parties , congress or the hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
after five years at the helm , the alliance headed by dr manmohan singh has much to smile about .
for four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , india will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government read your views on this article yet , the congress is a shadow of its former self .
it last secured a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
its rival , the bjp , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
for the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , tamil nadu and andhra pradesh .
recently a long time ally in the eastern state of orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the bjp 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
excluded groups india 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the united front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
the bjp has failed to accommodate regional sentiment the coalition government was headed by hd deve gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in karnataka .
he did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
given that indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
uttar pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as brazil .
its chief minister mayawati , may well be a contender .
she is both a woman and dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
states in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the world bank .
n chandrababu naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in andhra pradesh in southern india .
a pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state-level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
the " bete noire " of congress , he has moved away from the bjp .
mr naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the third front in indian politics .
it is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
there is no one large all-india party at its core .
all these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
marginal players in general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
changing fortunes seats won by congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
in 2004:145 seats won by bjp in 1984 elections : 2 .
in 2004:138 seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
in 2004:154 in uttar pradesh , the congress and bjp between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
the former is a marginal player in the entire gangetic basin , not just in uttar pradesh but in bihar and west bengal .
in turn , the bjp has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern india .
since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
as elections near , with results out on 16 may after a five-phase poll across this vast land , india is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
but the baton may just pass from congress hands .
it may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
such an arrangement will be shaky .
congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post-poll alliance that can continue to rule india .
even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
while by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
the polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
these now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
fading appeal the congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
this is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
it also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
initially , the cultivating communities of north india and then the dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
beyond hindi speaking north india , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
the bjp far less than the congress never quite managed , except in gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
the two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
federal governments in india have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the congress .
this may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
while such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
this was the case with vp singh , who as prime minister -lrb- 1989-90 -rrb- redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
strange as it may sound , short-lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
the world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
mahesh rangarajan is a leading historian .
he teaches at delhi university .
here is a selection of your comments .
mahesh rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
while politics in india may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
in this sense , democracy in india continues to be an evolving success .
however , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
the ideal governments in india , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
one can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
shantanu rao , usa this is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation. i would like to add that formation of the mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the lower house .
the congress had won 64 of these while the bjp had won 38 .
both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
the strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing house may not cross 225 in the 15th house .
that will be invitation to political instability at the time when india needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
but the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
that is not a very healthy trend .
sanghvi vijay , india in the opening lines you have said congress and hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party .
if you were an unbiased writer you would have not included hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
but it is not the case .
the english speaking media has a bias and always labels bjp as communal and saffron party .
is it a crime to be a hindu in india ?
why are hindus always at the receiving end ?
why not the congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
or call the communists as red ?
rasita , india mahesh rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
but still the major member of the coalition government will be only congress or the bjp .
it has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in india .
indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
i strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be bjp in the north india .
it has been very clearly demonstrated that bjp has been able to capture power in many states like karnataka in the south where it had never ruled .
people in tamil nadu prefer bjp for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral -lrb- road sector -rrb- .
gopalan subramanian , india !
somehow i feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in india .
the regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the indo-us nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the congress party .
in another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies aiadmk led to the untimely fall of the bjp party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax-payer 's money in another election .
regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
coalition politics can not be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
i am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy. those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
pulkit nigam , usa i fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
that is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
tamil nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - i fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of india as a whole .
it is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
anil , usa the weakening of the national parties in india is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
they tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
in a way there is poetic justice in all this-the people of india having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
this is unlikely to change in near future .
harjot kahlon , usa a narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
however , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
i suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
i wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country can not afford a hung parliament and political horse trading laxman karajgikar , uk while agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in india , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
the anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
we must not take western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate india .
many european countries have successful coalition governments .
the last bjp led coalition and the current upa govt performance is reasonably good .
think of indian politics from indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
omkarnath kamalapurkar , india i can not agree more to the author .
this would really going to be a very challenging time for india .
with regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down india as a nation .
these are the testing times for india on the front of national security -lrb- terrorism -rrb- , integrity -lrb- naxalites -rrb- and now the economic slowdown .
in a situation like this , india requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
i hope that either bjp or congress would be able to form the government .
this is the best that india can hope for .
abhishek jain , india indian politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
they do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
we need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
somes guha , usa we indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of india .
we collectively inculcate in our mind that , we as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
we require leaders who know needs of nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
the leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the india .
a leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
we ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
shirish madhukar nawathe , india great article and nice to see democracy at work .
mohan , usa i believe a two-party system like that in us is better for india than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
the existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two-party system .
their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
irfan alvi , usa congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980 's when it overturned the shah bano maintenance court judgement of india 's supreme court , an act that eventually led to the babri mosque dispute .
it was accused -lrb- and still is -rrb- of openly favouring muslims over the majority hindu community .
the bjp has a problem in that its vision of a nationalistic india does not appeal to much of lower caste hindus , who see it -lrb- rightly or wrongly -rrb- as dominated by the upper castes .
its agenda also alienates much of the non-hindi parts of the country .
only in karnataka does it have a foothold outside north and west india .
i foresee another fractured mandate .
s kumar , london , uk it is now high time india should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st century .
mere economic growth is meaningless when human development index for india is worse than sub-saharan countries .
india must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from usa & germany in particular .
indian youth are directionless , politicians are power hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
population , corruption & reservation have taken front seats .
dr amrit patel , usa i disagree with many of your comments .
you have joined with foreign journalists in branding bjp as the hindu nationalist party .
it is more secular than congress , which is a feudal party .
you have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
you should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
in the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of uk , germany , usa , ireland , and many other countries where christians are in majority as christian nationalist parties .
viswanathan , usa before independence , india had only one party - the indian national congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the british out .
after independence , mahatma gandhi 's advice to dissolve the congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but congress under nehru was a coalition .
eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of congress into multiple parties .
the so-called national parties , congress and bjp , can not win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so-called regional parties .
since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
one salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
in the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in india and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
in course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like democrats and republicans in the u.s. , would emerge .
because of the parliamentary system , where party members can not cross-vote -lrb- as in the u.s. congress -rrb- on specific issues , indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
these would be resolved in an entirely indian fashion over the next few decades .
thiruvengadam ramakrishnan , u.s.a. i believe the congress party would emerge as the largest party in the lok sabha .
nazim emamali , trinidad thank you for an excellent analysis .
yes , both congress and bjp are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
but , one should not be surprised if the third front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
kp fabian , india i 'm very much hopeful that congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
my best wishes to upa front .
md hafizur rahman azad , bangladesh indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties . .educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
but there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
is it possible ?
only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
mass media must initiate the revolution .
samson aseervatam , india mahesh 's analysis of the indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
it is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what i would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
thinking forward , i feel that the indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
a decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
in such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
this is already true in many states like uttar pradesh , bihar and west bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
what has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
the greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
in this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
it is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
anirban sarkar , united kingdom while i see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , i also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
i further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
murli , uk it is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
there needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
in order to marginalize these small and regional parties , bjp and congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either congress or bjp depending upon number of seats they win , will form a government and the other will ensure that the government is not pulled down .
this will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
keshav sridhar , india the article is proof of current crisis in indian politics .
there is no party with proper policy or structure.the regionalism has been a issue in india which has been sidelined for long .the late it service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
this election will one step closer to end of indian tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of india education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
rabinder henry , india the regional parties who have ruled southern india have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
it is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern india .
though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
by electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south india are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united india but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
i strongly suggest that at least south india is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties raj , india the 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
the mandate will definitely be fragmented .
the congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
the party is going to increase its tally by 25- 35 seats .
the government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance -lrb- upa -rrb- .
the smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
the next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in south asia .
the past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
the poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
muslims and christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
krishnendu das , india i only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour india has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in south asia .
pakistan , nepal , sri lanka , and my own bangladesh have much to learn from india from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
never have we ever heard the army in india pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
despite india 's many faults , from denying kashmiris , assamese and numerous others from right of self-determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of democracy .
whilst india has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from bangladesh and sustained economic growth from sri lanka , india 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
that is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
a bangladeshi , uk speaking to my cousin in india about the upcoming election , i said " do n't vote bjp or i 'll smack you " .
his reply , " what should i do then ?
ineffectual congress ?
united front ? "
i think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in india .
a ' vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse india 's democratic system .
a change is needed .
trisha , sydney , australia i also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

the authority 's insurer , zurich municipal , has received 43 claims from drivers who say their cars were ruined at loddon bridge site last month .
the site at winnersh was submerged when the river loddon burst its banks due to melting snow upstream on 10 february claims are likely to top £ 500,000 which will be paid out by the council 's insurers .
motorist jackie wood , from shinfield , returned from work to find her new bmw " underwater in a swimming pool " .
she said : " we are very happy , the council has done us proud .
i think they considered the costs involved in taking it to court and took this option .
this was a regrettable situation and i 'm pleased that we can now start to consider settlement of these claim councillor norman jorgensen " i do think they have to take more care in the future . "
zurich municipal will deal with each case on its own merit and the claimants will be asked to provide evidence of costs they have incurred .
the council said the decision to open the site was given careful consideration .
it added the river 's water level was lower than a usual winter 's day , no heavy rain was forecast , and as only a flood watch was issued there appeared no reason to withdraw the service .
drivers were also advised not to park their cars in the lowest lying areas of the car park - and these areas were coned off .
the council and its park-and-ride partners have agreed that in future the facility will automatically be closed if an environment agency flood watch is issued .
councillor norman jorgensen , member for corporate services , said : " this was a regrettable situation and i 'm pleased that we can now start to consider settlement of these claims .
" with hindsight we would not have opened the park and ride that morning but unfortunately there was no way of knowing it would flood at all . "

the authority 's insurer , zurich municipal , has received 43 claims from drivers who say their cars were ruined at loddon bridge site last month .
the site at winnersh was submerged when the river loddon burst its banks due to melting snow upstream on 10 february claims are likely to top £ 500,000 which will be paid out by the council 's insurers .
motorist jackie wood , from shinfield , returned from work to find her new bmw " underwater in a swimming pool " .
she said : " we are very happy , the council has done us proud .
i think they considered the costs involved in taking it to court and took this option .
this was a regrettable situation and i 'm pleased that we can now start to consider settlement of these claim councillor norman jorgensen " i do think they have to take more care in the future . "
zurich municipal will deal with each case on its own merit and the claimants will be asked to provide evidence of costs they have incurred .
the council said the decision to open the site was given careful consideration .
it added the river 's water level was lower than a usual winter 's day , no heavy rain was forecast , and as only a flood watch was issued there appeared no reason to withdraw the service .
drivers were also advised not to park their cars in the lowest lying areas of the car park - and these areas were coned off .
the council and its park-and-ride partners have agreed that in future the facility will automatically be closed if an environment agency flood watch is issued .
councillor norman jorgensen , member for corporate services , said : " this was a regrettable situation and i 'm pleased that we can now start to consider settlement of these claims .
" with hindsight we would not have opened the park and ride that morning but unfortunately there was no way of knowing it would flood at all . "

it added the river 's water level was lower than a usual winter 's day , no heavy rain was forecast , and as only a flood watch was issued there appeared no reason to withdraw the service .
drivers were also advised not to park their cars in the lowest lying areas of the car park - and these areas were coned off .
the council and its park-and-ride partners have agreed that in future the facility will automatically be closed if an environment agency flood watch is issued .
councillor norman jorgensen , member for corporate services , said : " this was a regrettable situation and i 'm pleased that we can now start to consider settlement of these claims .
" with hindsight we would not have opened the park and ride that morning but unfortunately there was no way of knowing it would flood at all . "
