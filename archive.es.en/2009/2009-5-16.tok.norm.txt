but now , muslim author navid kermani has been dropped from the quartet after a controversial article has upset the two christian candidates .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a recent trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .
the prize , worth 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- is scheduled to be awarded on july 5. td / dpa / epd / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kremlin-backed project is intended to deliver russian natural gas to europe , but the european union is n't sure it 's interested .
both moscow and brussels are looking for new ways to feed europe 's hunger for fuel .
bitter price battles between russia and its gas transport partner ukraine have led to disruptions of gas supplies to europe , including during two cold weeks this past january .
the south stream is just one of two pipelines planned by russia to deliver gas to europe , while avoiding ukraine 's pipeline network .
the nord stream pipeline would deliver gas from russia directly to germany through the baltic sea .
eu seeking independent solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in january , germany 's gas reserves sank dangerously low however , russia has often been accused of using its gas reserves as a political weapon .
european customers rely on russia for one quarter of their natural gas .
tired of this dependence , the eu is looking to diversify its gas suppliers by backing the nabucco pipeline , which would move gas westward from central asia , bypassing both russia and ukraine .
but gazprom is n't convinced the eu 's project is about money at all .
“ activities around nabucco are being initiated by politicians , often from across the atlantic , because it is a political , not an economic project , ” gazprom said in a statement .
as of yet , the nabucco pipeline still does n't have guarantees from central asian governments that it will have enough gas to fill it .
but with the new signed deals , russian gas is scheduled to begin flowing through the south stream pipeline , under the black sea to bulgaria and then on to europe , by late 2015 .
gazprom still needs to reach deals with austria and slovenia . hf / gb / kj , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rivals bayern munich slipped up in hoffenheim , drawing 2-2 . clinical finishing from wolfsburg 's strikers secured the club a crucial 5-0 demolition of hanover .
brazilian grafite , the top scorer in the bundesliga , grabbed two goals , and his bosnian partner in crime edin dzeko snatched a hat-trick as the league leaders ran riot away from home .
" the chance to bring the title to wolfsburg is now huge , " coach felix magath told reporters after the match .
" this was a crucial step .
we made out life easier with this win .
but nothing is decided yet . "
wolfsburg are now two points clear at the top of the table , after second place team bayern munich stumbled in hoffenheim , salvaging just a 2-2 draw from a tricky away fixture .
with one match left in the season , wolfsburg are now masters of their own destiny : a win at home to werder bremen in the final fixture , and they will be crowned german champions .
even a draw next saturday would almost certainly suffice for wolfsburg to win their first ever budesliga title .
goal rush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job well done : coach felix magath congratulates striker grafite wolfsburg 's success is largely thanks to their flowing attacking style .
with 75 goals so far this season , the team has scored the most goals in the bundesliga .
51 of these goals have come from their strike partnership , 26 from grafite and 25 from edin dzeko .
these two forwards are the two top scorers in the entire league .
dzeko opened the scoring in style in hannover after fourteen minutes , rifling a half-volley into the top corner from distance .
dzeko picked up two more in the second half , after grafite grabbed two quick-fire goals for his tally , too .
the dominant 5-0 victory never looked in doubt .
hanover had a few moments going forward , but for most of the ninety minutes wolfsburg 's north german rivals were on the back foot .

their campaign lost momentum in the second half of the year , but the little german club with big money behind it might just have decided the championship result after all .
hoffenheim held visiting bayern munich to a 2-2 draw , opening the door for wolfsburg to stretch their lead .
bayern 's french playmaker franck ribery opened the scoring on nine minutes , and was outstanding for the entire ninety .
however , hoffenheim struck back through striker demba ba and then midfielder carlos eduardo to take a 2-1 lead .
just before half-time ribery picked out luca toni with a pinpoint cross , and the italian international put bayern level .
depsite piling on the pressure in the second half , the defending champions from bavaria could n't find a way past hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
the score remained 2-2 .

stuttgart are third in the table , level on points with bayern munich , but trailing on goal difference .
in their final fixture of the season , stuttgart travel to munich to play bayern , in what will be a winner-takes-all encounter .
even if wolfsburg win and claim the title as their own , stuttgart and bayern will be fighting for the coveted second place in the league , which secures automatic qualification for the champions ' league next year .
bayern munich run the risk of losing superstar franck ribery if they miss out on the runner 's up spot and on champions ' league football .

it looks like these three sides will fight amongst each other to avoid relegation to the second division .
borussia mönchengladbach , the closest team to the drop zone , missed the chance to mathematically guarantee their safety saturday as they were dismantled 5-0 by bayer leverkusen , however with a superior goal difference and a three point advantage over bielefeld and cottbus , they are still well placed to stay in the german top flight for another year .

the rally was part of a series of protests across the european union . trade union officials said 100,000 people took part in berlin 's protest , while police put the total at " several tens of thousands " .

europe needs a new social deal " .
amidst germany 's deepest recession since world war two , unemployment has risen consecutively in the past 6 months and forecasts for the coming year are even bleaker .

" change is overdue " dgb 's head , michael sommer , told the crowd of protestors that " if we do n't act now , there will be consequences for democracy and social peace " .
" a change is overdue , " he said , calling for provisions to be introduced that would ensure there will be no repeat of the current financial crisis .

but now , muslim author navid kermani has been dropped from the quartet after a controversial article has upset the two christian candidates .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a recent trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .
the prize , worth 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- is scheduled to be awarded on july 5. td / dpa / epd / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , muslim author navid kermani has been dropped from the quartet after a controversial article has upset the two christian candidates .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a recent trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .

the rally was part of a series of protests across the european union . trade union officials said 100,000 people took part in berlin 's protest , while police put the total at " several tens of thousands " .
the rally was organized by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- as part of a series of four demonstrations across europe with the motto " fight the crisis .
europe needs a new social deal " .
amidst germany 's deepest recession since world war two , unemployment has risen consecutively in the past 6 months and forecasts for the coming year are even bleaker .
demonstrators accused the government of putting big business first , and not doing enough to protect the people .
" change is overdue " dgb 's head , michael sommer , told the crowd of protestors that " if we do n't act now , there will be consequences for democracy and social peace " .
" a change is overdue , " he said , calling for provisions to be introduced that would ensure there will be no repeat of the current financial crisis .
berthold huber , chairman of ig metall , the engineering workers ' union , called for a " protective shield " for employees .
frank bsirske , from the union ver.di , appealed for berlin to introduce a third economic stimulus package - to add to its previous stimulus packages which , combined , are worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ us 110 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd politician franz muentefering wanted to show his support to german workers this suggestion , however , was dismissed by franz muentefering , the chairman of the social democratic party .
instead , muentefering , who was the highest profile government politician to join the protests , told the demonstrators , " we are here to oppose international financial capitalism " .
" we must do all we can at the moment to protect jobs , " he said .
almost 300,000 people in germany have lost their jobs since the us investment bank lehman brothers went bankrupt in september 2008 , and the country 's gross domestic product is falling to record levels .
protestors united across europe the rallies began on thursday when up to 50,000 turned out for a protest in madrid .
it was followed by a march in brussels on friday , and an estimated 20,000 rallied in prague on saturday .
in brussels , the head of the european trade union confederation , john monks , told the demonstrators that a model " that comes with a social safety net " is needed .
" it offers a fall-back whenever the greed and excesses of financial capitalism give individuals a real battering , " he added , urging politicians to " take active , ambitious , coordinated , social measures " . cg / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , muslim author navid kermani has been dropped from the quartet after a controversial article has upset the two christian candidates .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a recent trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .
the prize , worth 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- is scheduled to be awarded on july 5. td / dpa / epd / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the chance to bring the title to wolfsburg is now huge , " coach felix magath told reporters after the match .
" this was a crucial step .
we made out life easier with this win .
but nothing is decided yet . "
wolfsburg are now two points clear at the top of the table , after second place team bayern munich stumbled in hoffenheim , salvaging just a 2-2 draw from a tricky away fixture .
with one match left in the season , wolfsburg are now masters of their own destiny : a win at home to werder bremen in the final fixture , and they will be crowned german champions .
even a draw next saturday would almost certainly suffice for wolfsburg to win their first ever budesliga title .
goal rush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job well done : coach felix magath congratulates striker grafite wolfsburg 's success is largely thanks to their flowing attacking style .

51 of these goals have come from their strike partnership , 26 from grafite and 25 from edin dzeko .
these two forwards are the two top scorers in the entire league .
dzeko opened the scoring in style in hannover after fourteen minutes , rifling a half-volley into the top corner from distance .
dzeko picked up two more in the second half , after grafite grabbed two quick-fire goals for his tally , too .

just before half-time ribery picked out luca toni with a pinpoint cross , and the italian international put bayern level .

stuttgart are third in the table , level on points with bayern munich , but trailing on goal difference .
in their final fixture of the season , stuttgart travel to munich to play bayern , in what will be a winner-takes-all encounter .
even if wolfsburg win and claim the title as their own , stuttgart and bayern will be fighting for the coveted second place in the league , which secures automatic qualification for the champions ' league next year .
bayern munich run the risk of losing superstar franck ribery if they miss out on the runner 's up spot and on champions ' league football .

but now , muslim author navid kermani has been dropped from the quartet after a controversial article has upset the two christian candidates .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .

rivals bayern munich slipped up in hoffenheim , drawing 2-2 . clinical finishing from wolfsburg 's strikers secured the club a crucial 5-0 demolition of hanover .
brazilian grafite , the top scorer in the bundesliga , grabbed two goals , and his bosnian partner in crime edin dzeko snatched a hat-trick as the league leaders ran riot away from home .
" the chance to bring the title to wolfsburg is now huge , " coach felix magath told reporters after the match .
" this was a crucial step .
we made out life easier with this win .
but nothing is decided yet . "
wolfsburg are now two points clear at the top of the table , after second place team bayern munich stumbled in hoffenheim , salvaging just a 2-2 draw from a tricky away fixture .
with one match left in the season , wolfsburg are now masters of their own destiny : a win at home to werder bremen in the final fixture , and they will be crowned german champions .
even a draw next saturday would almost certainly suffice for wolfsburg to win their first ever budesliga title .
goal rush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job well done : coach felix magath congratulates striker grafite wolfsburg 's success is largely thanks to their flowing attacking style .
with 75 goals so far this season , the team has scored the most goals in the bundesliga .
51 of these goals have come from their strike partnership , 26 from grafite and 25 from edin dzeko .
these two forwards are the two top scorers in the entire league .
dzeko opened the scoring in style in hannover after fourteen minutes , rifling a half-volley into the top corner from distance .
dzeko picked up two more in the second half , after grafite grabbed two quick-fire goals for his tally , too .
the dominant 5-0 victory never looked in doubt .
hanover had a few moments going forward , but for most of the ninety minutes wolfsburg 's north german rivals were on the back foot .
hoffenheim dash bayern munich 's hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery may not wear a bayern shirt at all next season half-way through the season , it looked like newly-promoted hoffenheim might challenge for the league title .
their campaign lost momentum in the second half of the year , but the little german club with big money behind it might just have decided the championship result after all .
hoffenheim held visiting bayern munich to a 2-2 draw , opening the door for wolfsburg to stretch their lead .
bayern 's french playmaker franck ribery opened the scoring on nine minutes , and was outstanding for the entire ninety .
however , hoffenheim struck back through striker demba ba and then midfielder carlos eduardo to take a 2-1 lead .
just before half-time ribery picked out luca toni with a pinpoint cross , and the italian international put bayern level .
depsite piling on the pressure in the second half , the defending champions from bavaria could n't find a way past hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
the score remained 2-2 .
stuttgart still in with a shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and luca toni need to pick themselves up ready to face stuttgart germany 's 2007 league champions stuttgart - who have been extremely strong in the second half of the season - beat struggling energie cottbus 2-0 , keeping their championship hopes alive .
stuttgart are third in the table , level on points with bayern munich , but trailing on goal difference .
in their final fixture of the season , stuttgart travel to munich to play bayern , in what will be a winner-takes-all encounter .
even if wolfsburg win and claim the title as their own , stuttgart and bayern will be fighting for the coveted second place in the league , which secures automatic qualification for the champions ' league next year .
bayern munich run the risk of losing superstar franck ribery if they miss out on the runner 's up spot and on champions ' league football .
drop zone bottom side karslruhe salvaged themselves a glimmer of hope in their fight for bundesliga survival , winning 3-1 in bremen .
karlsruhe are still last on 26 points , but cottbus and bielefeld both lost on saturday , staying on 27 points each .
it looks like these three sides will fight amongst each other to avoid relegation to the second division .
borussia mönchengladbach , the closest team to the drop zone , missed the chance to mathematically guarantee their safety saturday as they were dismantled 5-0 by bayer leverkusen , however with a superior goal difference and a three point advantage over bielefeld and cottbus , they are still well placed to stay in the german top flight for another year .
in the bundesliga , the bottom two clubs are automatically relegated , whilst third from bottom enters a playoff fixture against the third place team from the second division. msh / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .
on may 10 , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble called on washington to provide more data on potential transfer candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is wary of taking in guantanamo detainees " first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat ?
this is the main concern for many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them in ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? "
schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "
obama halted the guantanamo tribunals pending a review after taking office in january .
however , he did not rule out the use of a modified system in the future . nk / kj , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rally was part of a series of protests across the european union . trade union officials said 100,000 people took part in berlin 's protest , while police put the total at " several tens of thousands " .
the rally was organized by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- as part of a series of four demonstrations across europe with the motto " fight the crisis .
europe needs a new social deal " .
amidst germany 's deepest recession since world war two , unemployment has risen consecutively in the past 6 months and forecasts for the coming year are even bleaker .
demonstrators accused the government of putting big business first , and not doing enough to protect the people .
" change is overdue " dgb 's head , michael sommer , told the crowd of protestors that " if we do n't act now , there will be consequences for democracy and social peace " .
" a change is overdue , " he said , calling for provisions to be introduced that would ensure there will be no repeat of the current financial crisis .
berthold huber , chairman of ig metall , the engineering workers ' union , called for a " protective shield " for employees .
frank bsirske , from the union ver.di , appealed for berlin to introduce a third economic stimulus package - to add to its previous stimulus packages which , combined , are worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ us 110 billion -rrb- .

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .
on may 10 , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble called on washington to provide more data on potential transfer candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is wary of taking in guantanamo detainees " first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat ?
this is the main concern for many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them in ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? "
schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "
obama halted the guantanamo tribunals pending a review after taking office in january .
however , he did not rule out the use of a modified system in the future . nk / kj , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rivals bayern munich slipped up in hoffenheim , drawing 2-2 . clinical finishing from wolfsburg 's strikers secured the club a crucial 5-0 demolition of hanover .
brazilian grafite , the top scorer in the bundesliga , grabbed two goals , and his bosnian partner in crime edin dzeko snatched a hat-trick as the league leaders ran riot away from home .
" the chance to bring the title to wolfsburg is now huge , " coach felix magath told reporters after the match .
" this was a crucial step .
we made out life easier with this win .
but nothing is decided yet . "
wolfsburg are now two points clear at the top of the table , after second place team bayern munich stumbled in hoffenheim , salvaging just a 2-2 draw from a tricky away fixture .
with one match left in the season , wolfsburg are now masters of their own destiny : a win at home to werder bremen in the final fixture , and they will be crowned german champions .
even a draw next saturday would almost certainly suffice for wolfsburg to win their first ever budesliga title .
goal rush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job well done : coach felix magath congratulates striker grafite wolfsburg 's success is largely thanks to their flowing attacking style .
with 75 goals so far this season , the team has scored the most goals in the bundesliga .
51 of these goals have come from their strike partnership , 26 from grafite and 25 from edin dzeko .
these two forwards are the two top scorers in the entire league .
dzeko opened the scoring in style in hannover after fourteen minutes , rifling a half-volley into the top corner from distance .
dzeko picked up two more in the second half , after grafite grabbed two quick-fire goals for his tally , too .
the dominant 5-0 victory never looked in doubt .
hanover had a few moments going forward , but for most of the ninety minutes wolfsburg 's north german rivals were on the back foot .
hoffenheim dash bayern munich 's hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery may not wear a bayern shirt at all next season half-way through the season , it looked like newly-promoted hoffenheim might challenge for the league title .
their campaign lost momentum in the second half of the year , but the little german club with big money behind it might just have decided the championship result after all .
hoffenheim held visiting bayern munich to a 2-2 draw , opening the door for wolfsburg to stretch their lead .
bayern 's french playmaker franck ribery opened the scoring on nine minutes , and was outstanding for the entire ninety .
however , hoffenheim struck back through striker demba ba and then midfielder carlos eduardo to take a 2-1 lead .
just before half-time ribery picked out luca toni with a pinpoint cross , and the italian international put bayern level .
depsite piling on the pressure in the second half , the defending champions from bavaria could n't find a way past hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
the score remained 2-2 .
stuttgart still in with a shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and luca toni need to pick themselves up ready to face stuttgart germany 's 2007 league champions stuttgart - who have been extremely strong in the second half of the season - beat struggling energie cottbus 2-0 , keeping their championship hopes alive .
stuttgart are third in the table , level on points with bayern munich , but trailing on goal difference .
in their final fixture of the season , stuttgart travel to munich to play bayern , in what will be a winner-takes-all encounter .
even if wolfsburg win and claim the title as their own , stuttgart and bayern will be fighting for the coveted second place in the league , which secures automatic qualification for the champions ' league next year .
bayern munich run the risk of losing superstar franck ribery if they miss out on the runner 's up spot and on champions ' league football .
drop zone bottom side karslruhe salvaged themselves a glimmer of hope in their fight for bundesliga survival , winning 3-1 in bremen .
karlsruhe are still last on 26 points , but cottbus and bielefeld both lost on saturday , staying on 27 points each .
it looks like these three sides will fight amongst each other to avoid relegation to the second division .
borussia mönchengladbach , the closest team to the drop zone , missed the chance to mathematically guarantee their safety saturday as they were dismantled 5-0 by bayer leverkusen , however with a superior goal difference and a three point advantage over bielefeld and cottbus , they are still well placed to stay in the german top flight for another year .
in the bundesliga , the bottom two clubs are automatically relegated , whilst third from bottom enters a playoff fixture against the third place team from the second division. msh / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .

they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .

the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 16.05.2009 gay protestors arrested in moscow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights activists say that russia 's alleged homophobia is " a disgrace . "
a banned gay rights demonstration was broken up by moscow police and at least a dozen protestors were arrested on the eve of the international day of anti-homophobia . riot police have forcefully broken up an unauthorized march by supporters of gay rights in moscow , a city now infamous for its crackdowns on gay protests and events .
the banned march was meant to coincide with saturday 's eurovision pop-music contest , which has a big gay following and is taking place in moscow for the first time .
despite the city government 's refusal to sanction the march , a small group of protestors assembled near moscow state university , shouting " homophobia is the shame of russia ! " and " equal rights for everyone ! " .
among those arrested was one of the country 's leading gay rights activists nikolai alexeyev .
others were taken into custody after attempting to speak with journalists .

a banned gay rights demonstration was broken up by moscow police and at least a dozen protestors were arrested on the eve of the international day of anti-homophobia . riot police have forcefully broken up an unauthorized march by supporters of gay rights in moscow , a city now infamous for its crackdowns on gay protests and events .
the banned march was meant to coincide with saturday 's eurovision pop-music contest , which has a big gay following and is taking place in moscow for the first time .
despite the city government 's refusal to sanction the march , a small group of protestors assembled near moscow state university , shouting " homophobia is the shame of russia ! " and " equal rights for everyone ! " .
among those arrested was one of the country 's leading gay rights activists nikolai alexeyev .

but now , muslim author navid kermani has been dropped from the quartet after a controversial article has upset the two christian candidates .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a recent trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .
the prize , worth 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- is scheduled to be awarded on july 5. td / dpa / epd / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.05.2009 france receives first guantanamo detainee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fate of many guantanamo prisoners remains unresolved france has become the first eu nation to take in a former guantanamo inmate who does n't have any direct link to the host country . an algerian native was released from guantanamo bay prison and transferred to france on friday after spending seven years behind bars . 42-year-old lakhdar boumediene is the first guantanamo detainee to be granted refuge abroad without having any direct citizenship or residency claim in the host country .
his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .
on may 10 , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble called on washington to provide more data on potential transfer candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is wary of taking in guantanamo detainees " first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat ?
this is the main concern for many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them in ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? "
schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "
obama halted the guantanamo tribunals pending a review after taking office in january .
however , he did not rule out the use of a modified system in the future . nk / kj , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .
the prize , worth 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- is scheduled to be awarded on july 5. td / dpa / epd / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
this followed a complaint from the european broadcasting union , which stated the song - or rather dita von teese 's outfit - was not suitable for family viewing .
" the ebu told us we should take account of cultural differences between ourselves and other countries , " said thomas schreiber of german public broadcaster ard .
frontal nudity is common on german television .
von teese will apply her feminine touch to the song performed by " alex swings , oscar sings ! " - a duo made up of alex christensen from hamburg and oscar loya from the us .
germany has only won the contest once since eurovision began in 1956 , although it has participated in all of them except one , in 1996 .
last year germany was placed 23rd out of 25 entries .
it will be looking to do better than that this year , however norway , turkey and france are favorites to win .
more than 20,000 people were expected to watch the final live at the olimpiyskiy indoor arena in moscow , while an estimated 100 million television viewers were expected to tune in across europe and the world . cg / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .
on may 10 , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble called on washington to provide more data on potential transfer candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is wary of taking in guantanamo detainees " first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat ?
this is the main concern for many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them in ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? "
schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "
obama halted the guantanamo tribunals pending a review after taking office in january .

according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .

but now , muslim author navid kermani has been dropped from the quartet after a controversial article has upset the two christian candidates .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a recent trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .
the prize , worth 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- is scheduled to be awarded on july 5. td / dpa / epd / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .

rivals bayern munich slipped up in hoffenheim , drawing 2-2 . clinical finishing from wolfsburg 's strikers secured the club a crucial 5-0 demolition of hanover .
brazilian grafite , the top scorer in the bundesliga , grabbed two goals , and his bosnian partner in crime edin dzeko snatched a hat-trick as the league leaders ran riot away from home .
" the chance to bring the title to wolfsburg is now huge , " coach felix magath told reporters after the match .
" this was a crucial step .
we made out life easier with this win .
but nothing is decided yet . "
wolfsburg are now two points clear at the top of the table , after second place team bayern munich stumbled in hoffenheim , salvaging just a 2-2 draw from a tricky away fixture .
with one match left in the season , wolfsburg are now masters of their own destiny : a win at home to werder bremen in the final fixture , and they will be crowned german champions .
even a draw next saturday would almost certainly suffice for wolfsburg to win their first ever budesliga title .
goal rush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job well done : coach felix magath congratulates striker grafite wolfsburg 's success is largely thanks to their flowing attacking style .
with 75 goals so far this season , the team has scored the most goals in the bundesliga .
51 of these goals have come from their strike partnership , 26 from grafite and 25 from edin dzeko .
these two forwards are the two top scorers in the entire league .
dzeko opened the scoring in style in hannover after fourteen minutes , rifling a half-volley into the top corner from distance .
dzeko picked up two more in the second half , after grafite grabbed two quick-fire goals for his tally , too .
the dominant 5-0 victory never looked in doubt .
hanover had a few moments going forward , but for most of the ninety minutes wolfsburg 's north german rivals were on the back foot .
hoffenheim dash bayern munich 's hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery may not wear a bayern shirt at all next season half-way through the season , it looked like newly-promoted hoffenheim might challenge for the league title .
their campaign lost momentum in the second half of the year , but the little german club with big money behind it might just have decided the championship result after all .
hoffenheim held visiting bayern munich to a 2-2 draw , opening the door for wolfsburg to stretch their lead .
bayern 's french playmaker franck ribery opened the scoring on nine minutes , and was outstanding for the entire ninety .
however , hoffenheim struck back through striker demba ba and then midfielder carlos eduardo to take a 2-1 lead .
just before half-time ribery picked out luca toni with a pinpoint cross , and the italian international put bayern level .
depsite piling on the pressure in the second half , the defending champions from bavaria could n't find a way past hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
the score remained 2-2 .
stuttgart still in with a shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and luca toni need to pick themselves up ready to face stuttgart germany 's 2007 league champions stuttgart - who have been extremely strong in the second half of the season - beat struggling energie cottbus 2-0 , keeping their championship hopes alive .
stuttgart are third in the table , level on points with bayern munich , but trailing on goal difference .
in their final fixture of the season , stuttgart travel to munich to play bayern , in what will be a winner-takes-all encounter .
even if wolfsburg win and claim the title as their own , stuttgart and bayern will be fighting for the coveted second place in the league , which secures automatic qualification for the champions ' league next year .
bayern munich run the risk of losing superstar franck ribery if they miss out on the runner 's up spot and on champions ' league football .
drop zone bottom side karslruhe salvaged themselves a glimmer of hope in their fight for bundesliga survival , winning 3-1 in bremen .
karlsruhe are still last on 26 points , but cottbus and bielefeld both lost on saturday , staying on 27 points each .
it looks like these three sides will fight amongst each other to avoid relegation to the second division .
borussia mönchengladbach , the closest team to the drop zone , missed the chance to mathematically guarantee their safety saturday as they were dismantled 5-0 by bayer leverkusen , however with a superior goal difference and a three point advantage over bielefeld and cottbus , they are still well placed to stay in the german top flight for another year .
in the bundesliga , the bottom two clubs are automatically relegated , whilst third from bottom enters a playoff fixture against the third place team from the second division. msh / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rivals bayern munich slipped up in hoffenheim , drawing 2-2 . clinical finishing from wolfsburg 's strikers secured the club a crucial 5-0 demolition of hanover .
brazilian grafite , the top scorer in the bundesliga , grabbed two goals , and his bosnian partner in crime edin dzeko snatched a hat-trick as the league leaders ran riot away from home .
" the chance to bring the title to wolfsburg is now huge , " coach felix magath told reporters after the match .
" this was a crucial step .
we made out life easier with this win .
but nothing is decided yet . "
wolfsburg are now two points clear at the top of the table , after second place team bayern munich stumbled in hoffenheim , salvaging just a 2-2 draw from a tricky away fixture .
with one match left in the season , wolfsburg are now masters of their own destiny : a win at home to werder bremen in the final fixture , and they will be crowned german champions .
even a draw next saturday would almost certainly suffice for wolfsburg to win their first ever budesliga title .
goal rush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job well done : coach felix magath congratulates striker grafite wolfsburg 's success is largely thanks to their flowing attacking style .
with 75 goals so far this season , the team has scored the most goals in the bundesliga .
51 of these goals have come from their strike partnership , 26 from grafite and 25 from edin dzeko .
these two forwards are the two top scorers in the entire league .
dzeko opened the scoring in style in hannover after fourteen minutes , rifling a half-volley into the top corner from distance .
dzeko picked up two more in the second half , after grafite grabbed two quick-fire goals for his tally , too .
the dominant 5-0 victory never looked in doubt .
hanover had a few moments going forward , but for most of the ninety minutes wolfsburg 's north german rivals were on the back foot .
hoffenheim dash bayern munich 's hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery may not wear a bayern shirt at all next season half-way through the season , it looked like newly-promoted hoffenheim might challenge for the league title .
their campaign lost momentum in the second half of the year , but the little german club with big money behind it might just have decided the championship result after all .
hoffenheim held visiting bayern munich to a 2-2 draw , opening the door for wolfsburg to stretch their lead .
bayern 's french playmaker franck ribery opened the scoring on nine minutes , and was outstanding for the entire ninety .
however , hoffenheim struck back through striker demba ba and then midfielder carlos eduardo to take a 2-1 lead .
just before half-time ribery picked out luca toni with a pinpoint cross , and the italian international put bayern level .
depsite piling on the pressure in the second half , the defending champions from bavaria could n't find a way past hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
the score remained 2-2 .
stuttgart still in with a shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and luca toni need to pick themselves up ready to face stuttgart germany 's 2007 league champions stuttgart - who have been extremely strong in the second half of the season - beat struggling energie cottbus 2-0 , keeping their championship hopes alive .
stuttgart are third in the table , level on points with bayern munich , but trailing on goal difference .
in their final fixture of the season , stuttgart travel to munich to play bayern , in what will be a winner-takes-all encounter .
even if wolfsburg win and claim the title as their own , stuttgart and bayern will be fighting for the coveted second place in the league , which secures automatic qualification for the champions ' league next year .
bayern munich run the risk of losing superstar franck ribery if they miss out on the runner 's up spot and on champions ' league football .
drop zone bottom side karslruhe salvaged themselves a glimmer of hope in their fight for bundesliga survival , winning 3-1 in bremen .
karlsruhe are still last on 26 points , but cottbus and bielefeld both lost on saturday , staying on 27 points each .
it looks like these three sides will fight amongst each other to avoid relegation to the second division .
borussia mönchengladbach , the closest team to the drop zone , missed the chance to mathematically guarantee their safety saturday as they were dismantled 5-0 by bayer leverkusen , however with a superior goal difference and a three point advantage over bielefeld and cottbus , they are still well placed to stay in the german top flight for another year .
in the bundesliga , the bottom two clubs are automatically relegated , whilst third from bottom enters a playoff fixture against the third place team from the second division. msh / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rivals bayern munich slipped up in hoffenheim , drawing 2-2 . clinical finishing from wolfsburg 's strikers secured the club a crucial 5-0 demolition of hanover .
brazilian grafite , the top scorer in the bundesliga , grabbed two goals , and his bosnian partner in crime edin dzeko snatched a hat-trick as the league leaders ran riot away from home .
" the chance to bring the title to wolfsburg is now huge , " coach felix magath told reporters after the match .
" this was a crucial step .
we made out life easier with this win .
but nothing is decided yet . "
wolfsburg are now two points clear at the top of the table , after second place team bayern munich stumbled in hoffenheim , salvaging just a 2-2 draw from a tricky away fixture .
with one match left in the season , wolfsburg are now masters of their own destiny : a win at home to werder bremen in the final fixture , and they will be crowned german champions .
even a draw next saturday would almost certainly suffice for wolfsburg to win their first ever budesliga title .
goal rush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job well done : coach felix magath congratulates striker grafite wolfsburg 's success is largely thanks to their flowing attacking style .
with 75 goals so far this season , the team has scored the most goals in the bundesliga .
51 of these goals have come from their strike partnership , 26 from grafite and 25 from edin dzeko .
these two forwards are the two top scorers in the entire league .
dzeko opened the scoring in style in hannover after fourteen minutes , rifling a half-volley into the top corner from distance .
dzeko picked up two more in the second half , after grafite grabbed two quick-fire goals for his tally , too .
the dominant 5-0 victory never looked in doubt .
hanover had a few moments going forward , but for most of the ninety minutes wolfsburg 's north german rivals were on the back foot .
hoffenheim dash bayern munich 's hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery may not wear a bayern shirt at all next season half-way through the season , it looked like newly-promoted hoffenheim might challenge for the league title .
their campaign lost momentum in the second half of the year , but the little german club with big money behind it might just have decided the championship result after all .
hoffenheim held visiting bayern munich to a 2-2 draw , opening the door for wolfsburg to stretch their lead .
bayern 's french playmaker franck ribery opened the scoring on nine minutes , and was outstanding for the entire ninety .
however , hoffenheim struck back through striker demba ba and then midfielder carlos eduardo to take a 2-1 lead .
just before half-time ribery picked out luca toni with a pinpoint cross , and the italian international put bayern level .
depsite piling on the pressure in the second half , the defending champions from bavaria could n't find a way past hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
the score remained 2-2 .
stuttgart still in with a shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and luca toni need to pick themselves up ready to face stuttgart germany 's 2007 league champions stuttgart - who have been extremely strong in the second half of the season - beat struggling energie cottbus 2-0 , keeping their championship hopes alive .
stuttgart are third in the table , level on points with bayern munich , but trailing on goal difference .
in their final fixture of the season , stuttgart travel to munich to play bayern , in what will be a winner-takes-all encounter .
even if wolfsburg win and claim the title as their own , stuttgart and bayern will be fighting for the coveted second place in the league , which secures automatic qualification for the champions ' league next year .
bayern munich run the risk of losing superstar franck ribery if they miss out on the runner 's up spot and on champions ' league football .
drop zone bottom side karslruhe salvaged themselves a glimmer of hope in their fight for bundesliga survival , winning 3-1 in bremen .
karlsruhe are still last on 26 points , but cottbus and bielefeld both lost on saturday , staying on 27 points each .
it looks like these three sides will fight amongst each other to avoid relegation to the second division .
borussia mönchengladbach , the closest team to the drop zone , missed the chance to mathematically guarantee their safety saturday as they were dismantled 5-0 by bayer leverkusen , however with a superior goal difference and a three point advantage over bielefeld and cottbus , they are still well placed to stay in the german top flight for another year .
in the bundesliga , the bottom two clubs are automatically relegated , whilst third from bottom enters a playoff fixture against the third place team from the second division. msh / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .

boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .

the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .
on may 10 , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble called on washington to provide more data on potential transfer candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is wary of taking in guantanamo detainees " first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat ?
this is the main concern for many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them in ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? "
schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "
obama halted the guantanamo tribunals pending a review after taking office in january .

a banned gay rights demonstration was broken up by moscow police and at least a dozen protestors were arrested on the eve of the international day of anti-homophobia . riot police have forcefully broken up an unauthorized march by supporters of gay rights in moscow , a city now infamous for its crackdowns on gay protests and events .
the banned march was meant to coincide with saturday 's eurovision pop-music contest , which has a big gay following and is taking place in moscow for the first time .
despite the city government 's refusal to sanction the march , a small group of protestors assembled near moscow state university , shouting " homophobia is the shame of russia ! " and " equal rights for everyone ! " .
among those arrested was one of the country 's leading gay rights activists nikolai alexeyev .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .

"
this followed a complaint from the european broadcasting union , which stated the song - or rather dita von teese 's outfit - was not suitable for family viewing .
" the ebu told us we should take account of cultural differences between ourselves and other countries , " said thomas schreiber of german public broadcaster ard .
frontal nudity is common on german television .
von teese will apply her feminine touch to the song performed by " alex swings , oscar sings ! " - a duo made up of alex christensen from hamburg and oscar loya from the us .
germany has only won the contest once since eurovision began in 1956 , although it has participated in all of them except one , in 1996 .
last year germany was placed 23rd out of 25 entries .
it will be looking to do better than that this year , however norway , turkey and france are favorites to win .
more than 20,000 people were expected to watch the final live at the olimpiyskiy indoor arena in moscow , while an estimated 100 million television viewers were expected to tune in across europe and the world . cg / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rally was part of a series of protests across the european union . trade union officials said 100,000 people took part in berlin 's protest , while police put the total at " several tens of thousands " .
the rally was organized by the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- as part of a series of four demonstrations across europe with the motto " fight the crisis .
europe needs a new social deal " .
amidst germany 's deepest recession since world war two , unemployment has risen consecutively in the past 6 months and forecasts for the coming year are even bleaker .
demonstrators accused the government of putting big business first , and not doing enough to protect the people .
" change is overdue " dgb 's head , michael sommer , told the crowd of protestors that " if we do n't act now , there will be consequences for democracy and social peace " .
" a change is overdue , " he said , calling for provisions to be introduced that would ensure there will be no repeat of the current financial crisis .
berthold huber , chairman of ig metall , the engineering workers ' union , called for a " protective shield " for employees .
frank bsirske , from the union ver.di , appealed for berlin to introduce a third economic stimulus package - to add to its previous stimulus packages which , combined , are worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ us 110 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd politician franz muentefering wanted to show his support to german workers this suggestion , however , was dismissed by franz muentefering , the chairman of the social democratic party .
instead , muentefering , who was the highest profile government politician to join the protests , told the demonstrators , " we are here to oppose international financial capitalism " .
" we must do all we can at the moment to protect jobs , " he said .
almost 300,000 people in germany have lost their jobs since the us investment bank lehman brothers went bankrupt in september 2008 , and the country 's gross domestic product is falling to record levels .
protestors united across europe the rallies began on thursday when up to 50,000 turned out for a protest in madrid .
it was followed by a march in brussels on friday , and an estimated 20,000 rallied in prague on saturday .
in brussels , the head of the european trade union confederation , john monks , told the demonstrators that a model " that comes with a social safety net " is needed .
" it offers a fall-back whenever the greed and excesses of financial capitalism give individuals a real battering , " he added , urging politicians to " take active , ambitious , coordinated , social measures " . cg / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a banned gay rights demonstration was broken up by moscow police and at least a dozen protestors were arrested on the eve of the international day of anti-homophobia . riot police have forcefully broken up an unauthorized march by supporters of gay rights in moscow , a city now infamous for its crackdowns on gay protests and events .
the banned march was meant to coincide with saturday 's eurovision pop-music contest , which has a big gay following and is taking place in moscow for the first time .
despite the city government 's refusal to sanction the march , a small group of protestors assembled near moscow state university , shouting " homophobia is the shame of russia ! " and " equal rights for everyone ! " .
among those arrested was one of the country 's leading gay rights activists nikolai alexeyev .
others were taken into custody after attempting to speak with journalists .

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .
on may 10 , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble called on washington to provide more data on potential transfer candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is wary of taking in guantanamo detainees " first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat ?
this is the main concern for many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them in ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? "
schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "
obama halted the guantanamo tribunals pending a review after taking office in january .
however , he did not rule out the use of a modified system in the future . nk / kj , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rivals bayern munich slipped up in hoffenheim , drawing 2-2 . clinical finishing from wolfsburg 's strikers secured the club a crucial 5-0 demolition of hanover .
brazilian grafite , the top scorer in the bundesliga , grabbed two goals , and his bosnian partner in crime edin dzeko snatched a hat-trick as the league leaders ran riot away from home .
" the chance to bring the title to wolfsburg is now huge , " coach felix magath told reporters after the match .
" this was a crucial step .
we made out life easier with this win .
but nothing is decided yet . "
wolfsburg are now two points clear at the top of the table , after second place team bayern munich stumbled in hoffenheim , salvaging just a 2-2 draw from a tricky away fixture .
with one match left in the season , wolfsburg are now masters of their own destiny : a win at home to werder bremen in the final fixture , and they will be crowned german champions .
even a draw next saturday would almost certainly suffice for wolfsburg to win their first ever budesliga title .
goal rush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job well done : coach felix magath congratulates striker grafite wolfsburg 's success is largely thanks to their flowing attacking style .
with 75 goals so far this season , the team has scored the most goals in the bundesliga .
51 of these goals have come from their strike partnership , 26 from grafite and 25 from edin dzeko .
these two forwards are the two top scorers in the entire league .
dzeko opened the scoring in style in hannover after fourteen minutes , rifling a half-volley into the top corner from distance .
dzeko picked up two more in the second half , after grafite grabbed two quick-fire goals for his tally , too .
the dominant 5-0 victory never looked in doubt .
hanover had a few moments going forward , but for most of the ninety minutes wolfsburg 's north german rivals were on the back foot .
hoffenheim dash bayern munich 's hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery may not wear a bayern shirt at all next season half-way through the season , it looked like newly-promoted hoffenheim might challenge for the league title .
their campaign lost momentum in the second half of the year , but the little german club with big money behind it might just have decided the championship result after all .
hoffenheim held visiting bayern munich to a 2-2 draw , opening the door for wolfsburg to stretch their lead .
bayern 's french playmaker franck ribery opened the scoring on nine minutes , and was outstanding for the entire ninety .
however , hoffenheim struck back through striker demba ba and then midfielder carlos eduardo to take a 2-1 lead .
just before half-time ribery picked out luca toni with a pinpoint cross , and the italian international put bayern level .
depsite piling on the pressure in the second half , the defending champions from bavaria could n't find a way past hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
the score remained 2-2 .
stuttgart still in with a shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and luca toni need to pick themselves up ready to face stuttgart germany 's 2007 league champions stuttgart - who have been extremely strong in the second half of the season - beat struggling energie cottbus 2-0 , keeping their championship hopes alive .
stuttgart are third in the table , level on points with bayern munich , but trailing on goal difference .
in their final fixture of the season , stuttgart travel to munich to play bayern , in what will be a winner-takes-all encounter .
even if wolfsburg win and claim the title as their own , stuttgart and bayern will be fighting for the coveted second place in the league , which secures automatic qualification for the champions ' league next year .
bayern munich run the risk of losing superstar franck ribery if they miss out on the runner 's up spot and on champions ' league football .
drop zone bottom side karslruhe salvaged themselves a glimmer of hope in their fight for bundesliga survival , winning 3-1 in bremen .
karlsruhe are still last on 26 points , but cottbus and bielefeld both lost on saturday , staying on 27 points each .
it looks like these three sides will fight amongst each other to avoid relegation to the second division .

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .

boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .

the kremlin-backed project is intended to deliver russian natural gas to europe , but the european union is n't sure it 's interested .
both moscow and brussels are looking for new ways to feed europe 's hunger for fuel .
bitter price battles between russia and its gas transport partner ukraine have led to disruptions of gas supplies to europe , including during two cold weeks this past january .
the south stream is just one of two pipelines planned by russia to deliver gas to europe , while avoiding ukraine 's pipeline network .
the nord stream pipeline would deliver gas from russia directly to germany through the baltic sea .
eu seeking independent solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in january , germany 's gas reserves sank dangerously low however , russia has often been accused of using its gas reserves as a political weapon .
european customers rely on russia for one quarter of their natural gas .
tired of this dependence , the eu is looking to diversify its gas suppliers by backing the nabucco pipeline , which would move gas westward from central asia , bypassing both russia and ukraine .
but gazprom is n't convinced the eu 's project is about money at all .
“ activities around nabucco are being initiated by politicians , often from across the atlantic , because it is a political , not an economic project , ” gazprom said in a statement .
as of yet , the nabucco pipeline still does n't have guarantees from central asian governments that it will have enough gas to fill it .
but with the new signed deals , russian gas is scheduled to begin flowing through the south stream pipeline , under the black sea to bulgaria and then on to europe , by late 2015 .

the kremlin-backed project is intended to deliver russian natural gas to europe , but the european union is n't sure it 's interested .
both moscow and brussels are looking for new ways to feed europe 's hunger for fuel .
bitter price battles between russia and its gas transport partner ukraine have led to disruptions of gas supplies to europe , including during two cold weeks this past january .
the south stream is just one of two pipelines planned by russia to deliver gas to europe , while avoiding ukraine 's pipeline network .
the nord stream pipeline would deliver gas from russia directly to germany through the baltic sea .
eu seeking independent solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in january , germany 's gas reserves sank dangerously low however , russia has often been accused of using its gas reserves as a political weapon .
european customers rely on russia for one quarter of their natural gas .
tired of this dependence , the eu is looking to diversify its gas suppliers by backing the nabucco pipeline , which would move gas westward from central asia , bypassing both russia and ukraine .
but gazprom is n't convinced the eu 's project is about money at all .
“ activities around nabucco are being initiated by politicians , often from across the atlantic , because it is a political , not an economic project , ” gazprom said in a statement .
as of yet , the nabucco pipeline still does n't have guarantees from central asian governments that it will have enough gas to fill it .
but with the new signed deals , russian gas is scheduled to begin flowing through the south stream pipeline , under the black sea to bulgaria and then on to europe , by late 2015 .
gazprom still needs to reach deals with austria and slovenia . hf / gb / kj , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a banned gay rights demonstration was broken up by moscow police and at least a dozen protestors were arrested on the eve of the international day of anti-homophobia . riot police have forcefully broken up an unauthorized march by supporters of gay rights in moscow , a city now infamous for its crackdowns on gay protests and events .
the banned march was meant to coincide with saturday 's eurovision pop-music contest , which has a big gay following and is taking place in moscow for the first time .
despite the city government 's refusal to sanction the march , a small group of protestors assembled near moscow state university , shouting " homophobia is the shame of russia ! " and " equal rights for everyone ! " .
among those arrested was one of the country 's leading gay rights activists nikolai alexeyev .
others were taken into custody after attempting to speak with journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gay pride protestors were dragged into detention buses moscow authorities have repeatedly denied permission for gay pride parades in recent years and events for homosexuals have been met with arrests by police and attacks by right-wing and religious extremists .
moscow mayor yuri luzhkov once described a gay rights parade as " satanic " .
a day against homophobia the arrests come as the world prepares to observe the international day of anti-homophobia .
events are planned in at least 50 countries , according to the quebec organization that first launched a day against homophobia in 2003 .
may 17 was chosen because it was on this date in 1990 that the world health organization removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses .
parades , lectures and support events are scheduled across europe .
in berlin a group dedicated to preventing violence against gays is planning to hold its third kiss marathon .
under the motto “ protect every kiss , ” the maneo group plans to meet at a memorial to gay victims of the nazi regime in the tiergarten park and simply kiss .
" the kiss represents love and affection , " maneo project manager bastian finke writes on the group 's website .
" we are calling for the kiss to be protected .
because tolerance is our future . " hj / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , muslim author navid kermani has been dropped from the quartet after a controversial article has upset the two christian candidates .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a recent trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .
the prize , worth 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- is scheduled to be awarded on july 5. td / dpa / epd / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this followed a complaint from the european broadcasting union , which stated the song - or rather dita von teese 's outfit - was not suitable for family viewing .
" the ebu told us we should take account of cultural differences between ourselves and other countries , " said thomas schreiber of german public broadcaster ard .
frontal nudity is common on german television .
von teese will apply her feminine touch to the song performed by " alex swings , oscar sings ! " - a duo made up of alex christensen from hamburg and oscar loya from the us .
germany has only won the contest once since eurovision began in 1956 , although it has participated in all of them except one , in 1996 .
last year germany was placed 23rd out of 25 entries .
it will be looking to do better than that this year , however norway , turkey and france are favorites to win .
more than 20,000 people were expected to watch the final live at the olimpiyskiy indoor arena in moscow , while an estimated 100 million television viewers were expected to tune in across europe and the world . cg / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rivals bayern munich slipped up in hoffenheim , drawing 2-2 . clinical finishing from wolfsburg 's strikers secured the club a crucial 5-0 demolition of hanover .
brazilian grafite , the top scorer in the bundesliga , grabbed two goals , and his bosnian partner in crime edin dzeko snatched a hat-trick as the league leaders ran riot away from home .
" the chance to bring the title to wolfsburg is now huge , " coach felix magath told reporters after the match .
" this was a crucial step .
we made out life easier with this win .
but nothing is decided yet . "
wolfsburg are now two points clear at the top of the table , after second place team bayern munich stumbled in hoffenheim , salvaging just a 2-2 draw from a tricky away fixture .
with one match left in the season , wolfsburg are now masters of their own destiny : a win at home to werder bremen in the final fixture , and they will be crowned german champions .
even a draw next saturday would almost certainly suffice for wolfsburg to win their first ever budesliga title .
goal rush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job well done : coach felix magath congratulates striker grafite wolfsburg 's success is largely thanks to their flowing attacking style .
with 75 goals so far this season , the team has scored the most goals in the bundesliga .
51 of these goals have come from their strike partnership , 26 from grafite and 25 from edin dzeko .
these two forwards are the two top scorers in the entire league .
dzeko opened the scoring in style in hannover after fourteen minutes , rifling a half-volley into the top corner from distance .
dzeko picked up two more in the second half , after grafite grabbed two quick-fire goals for his tally , too .
the dominant 5-0 victory never looked in doubt .
hanover had a few moments going forward , but for most of the ninety minutes wolfsburg 's north german rivals were on the back foot .
hoffenheim dash bayern munich 's hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery may not wear a bayern shirt at all next season half-way through the season , it looked like newly-promoted hoffenheim might challenge for the league title .
their campaign lost momentum in the second half of the year , but the little german club with big money behind it might just have decided the championship result after all .

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .
on may 10 , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble called on washington to provide more data on potential transfer candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is wary of taking in guantanamo detainees " first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat ?
this is the main concern for many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them in ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? "
schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "
obama halted the guantanamo tribunals pending a review after taking office in january .
however , he did not rule out the use of a modified system in the future . nk / kj , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , muslim author navid kermani has been dropped from the quartet after a controversial article has upset the two christian candidates .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a recent trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .
the prize , worth 45,000 euros -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- is scheduled to be awarded on july 5. td / dpa / epd / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .
on may 10 , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble called on washington to provide more data on potential transfer candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is wary of taking in guantanamo detainees " first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat ?
this is the main concern for many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them in ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? "
schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 16.05.2009 france receives first guantanamo detainee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fate of many guantanamo prisoners remains unresolved france has become the first eu nation to take in a former guantanamo inmate who does n't have any direct link to the host country . an algerian native was released from guantanamo bay prison and transferred to france on friday after spending seven years behind bars . 42-year-old lakhdar boumediene is the first guantanamo detainee to be granted refuge abroad without having any direct citizenship or residency claim in the host country .
his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .
on may 10 , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble called on washington to provide more data on potential transfer candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is wary of taking in guantanamo detainees " first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat ?
this is the main concern for many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them in ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? "
schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "
obama halted the guantanamo tribunals pending a review after taking office in january .
however , he did not rule out the use of a modified system in the future . nk / kj , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .

schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "

according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .

"
this followed a complaint from the european broadcasting union , which stated the song - or rather dita von teese 's outfit - was not suitable for family viewing .
" the ebu told us we should take account of cultural differences between ourselves and other countries , " said thomas schreiber of german public broadcaster ard .
frontal nudity is common on german television .
von teese will apply her feminine touch to the song performed by " alex swings , oscar sings ! " - a duo made up of alex christensen from hamburg and oscar loya from the us .
germany has only won the contest once since eurovision began in 1956 , although it has participated in all of them except one , in 1996 .
last year germany was placed 23rd out of 25 entries .
it will be looking to do better than that this year , however norway , turkey and france are favorites to win .
more than 20,000 people were expected to watch the final live at the olimpiyskiy indoor arena in moscow , while an estimated 100 million television viewers were expected to tune in across europe and the world . cg / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
this followed a complaint from the european broadcasting union , which stated the song - or rather dita von teese 's outfit - was not suitable for family viewing .
" the ebu told us we should take account of cultural differences between ourselves and other countries , " said thomas schreiber of german public broadcaster ard .
frontal nudity is common on german television .
von teese will apply her feminine touch to the song performed by " alex swings , oscar sings ! " - a duo made up of alex christensen from hamburg and oscar loya from the us .
germany has only won the contest once since eurovision began in 1956 , although it has participated in all of them except one , in 1996 .
last year germany was placed 23rd out of 25 entries .
it will be looking to do better than that this year , however norway , turkey and france are favorites to win .
more than 20,000 people were expected to watch the final live at the olimpiyskiy indoor arena in moscow , while an estimated 100 million television viewers were expected to tune in across europe and the world . cg / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , muslim author navid kermani has been dropped from the quartet after a controversial article has upset the two christian candidates .
catholic cardinal karl lehmann of mainz and peter steinacker , the former head of the lutheran church of hesse and nassau have objected to sharing the prize with kermani , a cologne-based writer who was born in iran .
in march , kermani penned an article for switzerland 's neue zuercher zeitung about a recent trip to rome , where he went to see a 17th century painting by guido reni depicting the crucifixion of jesus christ .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kermani 's analysis of a guido reni painting is at the centre of the dispute kermani 's piece is an analysis of the painting and leads to a philosophical discussion of the crucifix as a religious symbol .
" i 'd express my personal rejection of the theology of the cross frankly with ' blasphemy and idolatry ' . "
" not that i respect people who pray before the cross any less than other people at prayer .
this is n't an accusation .
it 's a rejection , " he wrote . this did not go down too well with cardinal lehmann and peter steinacker , who formally complained to the cultural committee of the state of hesse .
giving in to the pressure , the committee has responded by withdrawing the prize from kermani .
the fourth recipient is salomon korn of the central council of jews in germany . dilemma does n't end there the argument looks set to become a major scandal .
aiman mazyek , the general secretary of the central council of muslims , has described lehmann and steinackers ' reaction as " immature and childish . " the president of the german parliament , norbert lammert , said that if kermani 's article really is the reason for taking the prize away from him , then perhaps the state should abolish the prize altogether .
meanwhile , the lutheran bishop of berlin , markus droege , on saturday said he had little understanding of the controversy , adding that kermani 's stance should rather have been taken up as an offer for dialogue .

rivals bayern munich slipped up in hoffenheim , drawing 2-2 . clinical finishing from wolfsburg 's strikers secured the club a crucial 5-0 demolition of hanover .
brazilian grafite , the top scorer in the bundesliga , grabbed two goals , and his bosnian partner in crime edin dzeko snatched a hat-trick as the league leaders ran riot away from home .
" the chance to bring the title to wolfsburg is now huge , " coach felix magath told reporters after the match .
" this was a crucial step .
we made out life easier with this win .
but nothing is decided yet . "
wolfsburg are now two points clear at the top of the table , after second place team bayern munich stumbled in hoffenheim , salvaging just a 2-2 draw from a tricky away fixture .
with one match left in the season , wolfsburg are now masters of their own destiny : a win at home to werder bremen in the final fixture , and they will be crowned german champions .
even a draw next saturday would almost certainly suffice for wolfsburg to win their first ever budesliga title .
goal rush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job well done : coach felix magath congratulates striker grafite wolfsburg 's success is largely thanks to their flowing attacking style .
with 75 goals so far this season , the team has scored the most goals in the bundesliga .
51 of these goals have come from their strike partnership , 26 from grafite and 25 from edin dzeko .
these two forwards are the two top scorers in the entire league .
dzeko opened the scoring in style in hannover after fourteen minutes , rifling a half-volley into the top corner from distance .
dzeko picked up two more in the second half , after grafite grabbed two quick-fire goals for his tally , too .
the dominant 5-0 victory never looked in doubt .
hanover had a few moments going forward , but for most of the ninety minutes wolfsburg 's north german rivals were on the back foot .
hoffenheim dash bayern munich 's hopes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ribery may not wear a bayern shirt at all next season half-way through the season , it looked like newly-promoted hoffenheim might challenge for the league title .
their campaign lost momentum in the second half of the year , but the little german club with big money behind it might just have decided the championship result after all .
hoffenheim held visiting bayern munich to a 2-2 draw , opening the door for wolfsburg to stretch their lead .
bayern 's french playmaker franck ribery opened the scoring on nine minutes , and was outstanding for the entire ninety .
however , hoffenheim struck back through striker demba ba and then midfielder carlos eduardo to take a 2-1 lead .
just before half-time ribery picked out luca toni with a pinpoint cross , and the italian international put bayern level .
depsite piling on the pressure in the second half , the defending champions from bavaria could n't find a way past hoffenheim keeper timo hildebrand .
the score remained 2-2 .
stuttgart still in with a shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and luca toni need to pick themselves up ready to face stuttgart germany 's 2007 league champions stuttgart - who have been extremely strong in the second half of the season - beat struggling energie cottbus 2-0 , keeping their championship hopes alive .
stuttgart are third in the table , level on points with bayern munich , but trailing on goal difference .
in their final fixture of the season , stuttgart travel to munich to play bayern , in what will be a winner-takes-all encounter .
even if wolfsburg win and claim the title as their own , stuttgart and bayern will be fighting for the coveted second place in the league , which secures automatic qualification for the champions ' league next year .
bayern munich run the risk of losing superstar franck ribery if they miss out on the runner 's up spot and on champions ' league football .
drop zone bottom side karslruhe salvaged themselves a glimmer of hope in their fight for bundesliga survival , winning 3-1 in bremen .
karlsruhe are still last on 26 points , but cottbus and bielefeld both lost on saturday , staying on 27 points each .
it looks like these three sides will fight amongst each other to avoid relegation to the second division .
borussia mönchengladbach , the closest team to the drop zone , missed the chance to mathematically guarantee their safety saturday as they were dismantled 5-0 by bayer leverkusen , however with a superior goal difference and a three point advantage over bielefeld and cottbus , they are still well placed to stay in the german top flight for another year .
in the bundesliga , the bottom two clubs are automatically relegated , whilst third from bottom enters a playoff fixture against the third place team from the second division. msh / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kremlin-backed project is intended to deliver russian natural gas to europe , but the european union is n't sure it 's interested .
both moscow and brussels are looking for new ways to feed europe 's hunger for fuel .
bitter price battles between russia and its gas transport partner ukraine have led to disruptions of gas supplies to europe , including during two cold weeks this past january .
the south stream is just one of two pipelines planned by russia to deliver gas to europe , while avoiding ukraine 's pipeline network .
the nord stream pipeline would deliver gas from russia directly to germany through the baltic sea .
eu seeking independent solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in january , germany 's gas reserves sank dangerously low however , russia has often been accused of using its gas reserves as a political weapon .
european customers rely on russia for one quarter of their natural gas .
tired of this dependence , the eu is looking to diversify its gas suppliers by backing the nabucco pipeline , which would move gas westward from central asia , bypassing both russia and ukraine .
but gazprom is n't convinced the eu 's project is about money at all .
“ activities around nabucco are being initiated by politicians , often from across the atlantic , because it is a political , not an economic project , ” gazprom said in a statement .
as of yet , the nabucco pipeline still does n't have guarantees from central asian governments that it will have enough gas to fill it .
but with the new signed deals , russian gas is scheduled to begin flowing through the south stream pipeline , under the black sea to bulgaria and then on to europe , by late 2015 .
gazprom still needs to reach deals with austria and slovenia . hf / gb / kj , ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his transfer came after french president nicolas sarkozy promised to take in at least one guantanamo prisoner to help us president barack obama fulfil his pledge to close the controversial detention facility by the end of 2009 .
paris announced on may 6 that it was prepared to take in boumediene and also offered residency to his wife and two children .
" he has been cleared of all charges relative to participation in eventual terrorist activities , " a french foreign ministry spokesman said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama has pledged to close guantanamo nervertheless , boumediene will be subjected to a special visa ruling which will limit where he can travel within the 25-nation passport-free european schengen zone .
boumediene was among six guantanamo inmates arrested in bosnia in 2001 .
they were initially charged with plotting to attack the us embassy in sarajevo , but in november 2008 , a us judge cleared five of the six for release after ruling that they had been illegally detained .
the algerian 's release was made possible by a landmark us supreme court ruling last june that gave guantanamo detainees the legal right to challenge their imprisonment .
europe wary of guantanamo detainees boumediene 's transfer to france leaves 240 guantanamo detainees still facing an uncertain future .
although many european countries consider the prison camp a homegrown us problem , some have offered to take in released inmates under certain conditions .
on may 10 , german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble called on washington to provide more data on potential transfer candidates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is wary of taking in guantanamo detainees " first , are we sure that these people do not pose a threat ?
this is the main concern for many citizens here .
second , why ca n't the united states take them in ?
and third , do they have a link to germany ? "
schaueble said .
the guantanamo bay detention camp , which was established specially for terror suspects in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington , has come under severe fire from human rights groups . critics say prisoners were systematically tortured in the camp , describing it as a legal vacuum with inmates classified as " enemy combatants " rather than prisoners of war .
according to a 2002 directive by then president george w. bush , " enemy combatants " are not subject to the geneva conventions .
obama restarts guantanamo tribunals the transfer of boumediene came as us president barack obama announced that the controversial tribunals for trying terrorist suspects held at guantanamo bay would remain in place .
however , the president said new rules would be enacted to enhance the rights of defendants .
" these reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution , while bringing them in line with the rule of law , " obama said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics accuse obama of backtracking on campaign promises under the proposed changes , the use of evidence obtained through " cruel , inhumane and degrading " interrogation methods would no longer be admitted as evidence .
defendants would also have more leeway in choosing a defense attorney and would enjoy greater protections if they refused to testify .
obama 's announcement was criticized by rights activists , who accuse him of breaking an earlier campaign promise to end the tribunals .
" the military commissions system is flawed beyond repair , " said kenneth roth , executive director of human rights watch .
" by resurrecting this failed bush administration idea , president obama is backtracking dangerously on his reform agenda . "
obama halted the guantanamo tribunals pending a review after taking office in january .
however , he did not rule out the use of a modified system in the future . nk / kj , dpa / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
