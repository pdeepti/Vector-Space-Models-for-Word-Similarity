program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 29.05.2009 eu , acp trade talks end in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no deal but parties remain flexible wrapping up two days of intense talks , officials from the european union and their counterparts from the african , caribbean and pacific region -lrb- acp -rrb- have agreed to remain flexible . with both sides standing firm on their positions , talks between the eu and members of the acp ended friday .
no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .
temporary deals allow acp countries to export their products to europe without any customs duties , quotas or restrictions .
in return , acp countries will have to open their markets to european products .
rice and sugar would not be affected until 2010 and 2015 respectively .
parties to keep talking " there was commitment to continue with the negotiation process and implementation for the caribbean region , " said acp president william haome .
he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "
banana prices at issue one key demand from the acp countries is for europe to provide 500 million euros -lrb- $ 707 million -rrb- as compensation following an eu decision to lower customs duties for bananas coming from latin america .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acp countries fear latin american banana prices might go lower acp countries fear that european demand for their bananas will slump if latin american bananas cost less .
but talks have been dragging on in geneva between the world trade organization and the acp 's top banana producers , which are resisting lowering import tariffs for latin america .
" i find it especially important that together we recall the importance of maintaining an open , equitable and transparent trading system , especially in times of this economic crisis , and we call for an early , ambitious and balanced comprehensive agreement , " said eu commissioner olli rehn .
so , as is often the case with difficult negotiations in brussels , these meetings ended with positive statements and a promise from both sides to remain flexible .
diplomatic speak for " no one budged . "

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .

a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .

" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 29.05.2009 eu , acp trade talks end in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no deal but parties remain flexible wrapping up two days of intense talks , officials from the european union and their counterparts from the african , caribbean and pacific region -lrb- acp -rrb- have agreed to remain flexible . with both sides standing firm on their positions , talks between the eu and members of the acp ended friday .
no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .
temporary deals allow acp countries to export their products to europe without any customs duties , quotas or restrictions .
in return , acp countries will have to open their markets to european products .
rice and sugar would not be affected until 2010 and 2015 respectively .
parties to keep talking " there was commitment to continue with the negotiation process and implementation for the caribbean region , " said acp president william haome .
he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "
banana prices at issue one key demand from the acp countries is for europe to provide 500 million euros -lrb- $ 707 million -rrb- as compensation following an eu decision to lower customs duties for bananas coming from latin america .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acp countries fear latin american banana prices might go lower acp countries fear that european demand for their bananas will slump if latin american bananas cost less .
but talks have been dragging on in geneva between the world trade organization and the acp 's top banana producers , which are resisting lowering import tariffs for latin america .

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .

but recent spats between gas supplier russia and transit country ukraine have left some european countries in the cold .
some nations , including slovakia and its neighbor the czech republic , now think nuclear power may free them from their dependence on russian natural gas .
state-run companies from the czech republic and slovakia announced plans on friday to build a new nuclear reactor in jaslovske bohunice on the site of the old soviet power generator that was shut down last december .
the deal that was signed between czech energy company cez as and slovak state energy firm javys as will set up a joint-stock company to construct a new 100 billion koruny -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- reactor .
javys as will have a 51 percent stake while cez will control 49 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak prime minister robert fico does n't rule out starting up an old reactor no further details were provided , but a feasibility study , due to be completed by 2010 , will provide a timetable for the project .
as recently as this january , slovak officials threatened to re-start the old soviet reactor when gas supplies to several european union countries were halted because of a price dispute between russia and the ukraine .
no guarantees and slovakia still wo n't guarantee not to start the old reactor up again .
" i can not rule it out , " said slovak prime minister robert fico after the european nuclear energy forum in prague . " if there was such a threat in slovakia , it is more important to have light and warmth than dark and cold . "
both the czech and slovak republics are among the biggest proponents of nuclear power .
according to the world nuclear association , slovakia currently has five nuclear generators , which provide half of the country 's electricity , with two more under construction .
the czech republic has six nuclear plants which supply one third of its electricity. av / afp / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but recent spats between gas supplier russia and transit country ukraine have left some european countries in the cold .
some nations , including slovakia and its neighbor the czech republic , now think nuclear power may free them from their dependence on russian natural gas .
state-run companies from the czech republic and slovakia announced plans on friday to build a new nuclear reactor in jaslovske bohunice on the site of the old soviet power generator that was shut down last december .
the deal that was signed between czech energy company cez as and slovak state energy firm javys as will set up a joint-stock company to construct a new 100 billion koruny -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- reactor .
javys as will have a 51 percent stake while cez will control 49 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak prime minister robert fico does n't rule out starting up an old reactor no further details were provided , but a feasibility study , due to be completed by 2010 , will provide a timetable for the project .
as recently as this january , slovak officials threatened to re-start the old soviet reactor when gas supplies to several european union countries were halted because of a price dispute between russia and the ukraine .
no guarantees and slovakia still wo n't guarantee not to start the old reactor up again .
" i can not rule it out , " said slovak prime minister robert fico after the european nuclear energy forum in prague . " if there was such a threat in slovakia , it is more important to have light and warmth than dark and cold . "
both the czech and slovak republics are among the biggest proponents of nuclear power .
according to the world nuclear association , slovakia currently has five nuclear generators , which provide half of the country 's electricity , with two more under construction .

no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .
temporary deals allow acp countries to export their products to europe without any customs duties , quotas or restrictions .
in return , acp countries will have to open their markets to european products .
rice and sugar would not be affected until 2010 and 2015 respectively .
parties to keep talking " there was commitment to continue with the negotiation process and implementation for the caribbean region , " said acp president william haome .
he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "
banana prices at issue one key demand from the acp countries is for europe to provide 500 million euros -lrb- $ 707 million -rrb- as compensation following an eu decision to lower customs duties for bananas coming from latin america .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acp countries fear latin american banana prices might go lower acp countries fear that european demand for their bananas will slump if latin american bananas cost less .
but talks have been dragging on in geneva between the world trade organization and the acp 's top banana producers , which are resisting lowering import tariffs for latin america .
" i find it especially important that together we recall the importance of maintaining an open , equitable and transparent trading system , especially in times of this economic crisis , and we call for an early , ambitious and balanced comprehensive agreement , " said eu commissioner olli rehn .
so , as is often the case with difficult negotiations in brussels , these meetings ended with positive statements and a promise from both sides to remain flexible .
diplomatic speak for " no one budged . "

the european union says it 's on track to meet kyoto greenhouse gas reduction goals , but the prospects of it meeting its own more ambitious targets are less rosy . the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas is confident that eu countries will meet kyoto protocol goals of reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
the eu-15 -lrb- the 15 nations that made up the eu when kyoto was agreed upon -rrb- cut emissions by 1.6 percent in 2007 , bringing their total reductions to 5 percent below 1990 levels .
the eu-27 , which includes the 12 countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 , cut emissions by 1.2 percent , bringing their total to 9.3 percent below 1990 levels .
while the 12 newest eu countries are not bound to eu-wide kyoto promises , all member states , with the exception of cyprus and malta , are bound to individual reduction goals .
this latest drop " gives us confidence that we will successfully reach our kyoto target , " dimas said in a statement on friday .
" the proactive climate policies and measures taken nationally and at eu level since kyoto are starting to pay off . "
cuts may not be as significant as they sound the eu 's own report admits that the eu-15 reductions were due mainly to a warmer winter and industry reductions , which suggests that european citizens have not changed their energy-consumption habits .
new figures released by the copenhagen-based european environmental agency -lrb- eea -rrb- indicate that eu policies have had little effect on car and household emissions , which make up a quarter of the bloc 's total greenhouse gas output .
with kyoto set to expire in 2012 , the bigger issue may be whether the eu can meet its own greenhouse gas reduction targets .

the european union says it 's on track to meet kyoto greenhouse gas reduction goals , but the prospects of it meeting its own more ambitious targets are less rosy . the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas is confident that eu countries will meet kyoto protocol goals of reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
the eu-15 -lrb- the 15 nations that made up the eu when kyoto was agreed upon -rrb- cut emissions by 1.6 percent in 2007 , bringing their total reductions to 5 percent below 1990 levels .
the eu-27 , which includes the 12 countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 , cut emissions by 1.2 percent , bringing their total to 9.3 percent below 1990 levels .
while the 12 newest eu countries are not bound to eu-wide kyoto promises , all member states , with the exception of cyprus and malta , are bound to individual reduction goals .
this latest drop " gives us confidence that we will successfully reach our kyoto target , " dimas said in a statement on friday .
" the proactive climate policies and measures taken nationally and at eu level since kyoto are starting to pay off . "
cuts may not be as significant as they sound the eu 's own report admits that the eu-15 reductions were due mainly to a warmer winter and industry reductions , which suggests that european citizens have not changed their energy-consumption habits .
new figures released by the copenhagen-based european environmental agency -lrb- eea -rrb- indicate that eu policies have had little effect on car and household emissions , which make up a quarter of the bloc 's total greenhouse gas output .
with kyoto set to expire in 2012 , the bigger issue may be whether the eu can meet its own greenhouse gas reduction targets .
in march 2007 the eu agreed to cut emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
united nations talks scheduled to take plan in copenhagen later this year are intended to produce a climate change agreement to replace kyoto. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 29.05.2009 fiat pulls out of second opel meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must find a suitor for opel before gm files for bankruptcy german officials hold further talks with gm and the last remaining bidder , magna , to decide the future of opel .
if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .

the european union says it 's on track to meet kyoto greenhouse gas reduction goals , but the prospects of it meeting its own more ambitious targets are less rosy . the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas is confident that eu countries will meet kyoto protocol goals of reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
the eu-15 -lrb- the 15 nations that made up the eu when kyoto was agreed upon -rrb- cut emissions by 1.6 percent in 2007 , bringing their total reductions to 5 percent below 1990 levels .
the eu-27 , which includes the 12 countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 , cut emissions by 1.2 percent , bringing their total to 9.3 percent below 1990 levels .
while the 12 newest eu countries are not bound to eu-wide kyoto promises , all member states , with the exception of cyprus and malta , are bound to individual reduction goals .
this latest drop " gives us confidence that we will successfully reach our kyoto target , " dimas said in a statement on friday .
" the proactive climate policies and measures taken nationally and at eu level since kyoto are starting to pay off . "
cuts may not be as significant as they sound the eu 's own report admits that the eu-15 reductions were due mainly to a warmer winter and industry reductions , which suggests that european citizens have not changed their energy-consumption habits .
new figures released by the copenhagen-based european environmental agency -lrb- eea -rrb- indicate that eu policies have had little effect on car and household emissions , which make up a quarter of the bloc 's total greenhouse gas output .
with kyoto set to expire in 2012 , the bigger issue may be whether the eu can meet its own greenhouse gas reduction targets .
in march 2007 the eu agreed to cut emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
united nations talks scheduled to take plan in copenhagen later this year are intended to produce a climate change agreement to replace kyoto. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they could n't agree on the best path forward and germany 's environment minster says disaster looms .
-lrb- 26.05.2009 -rrb- germany prepares for mediterranean climate climate change is likely to offer a relatively kind fate to germany , but the country is already preparing for the mixed-bag in store .

if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .

media reports quoting german government officials now say that austrian-canadian car parts supplier magna has reached a preliminary agreement with general motors on the terms of a takeover of opel. dpa news agency reports that german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier mediated the agreement during talks with magna chief executive frank stronach . a number of questions remain unresolved , however , including the appointment of a board of trustees to oversee opel - a move demanded by berlin but opposed by the us administration glb / dpa / afp / reuters / bloomberg editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .
that 's not to say that we 'll come to a decision today – it 's a plan that we 'll have to submit to some scrutiny , and should look over carefully . " deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .
ceo sergio marchionne said it was " unreasonable to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , " adding that it would expose his company to " unnecessary and unwarranted " risks . political math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister zu guttenberg has been one of berlin 's lead negotiators the unexpected new 300-million-euro request upset german government representatives , as well .
the north rhine-westphalia state premier called the negotiating tactic " unacceptable , " and guttenberg , the german economics minister , said he was strictly against providing any funds to gm until a deal has been finalized . " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .
he said an appraisal of gm 's assets six months ago showed its european operations comprised nearly half of the company 's worth , and berlin should n't expect the americans to give it away . " we ca n't expect charity , " said koch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 29.05.2009 eu , acp trade talks end in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no deal but parties remain flexible wrapping up two days of intense talks , officials from the european union and their counterparts from the african , caribbean and pacific region -lrb- acp -rrb- have agreed to remain flexible . with both sides standing firm on their positions , talks between the eu and members of the acp ended friday .
no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .
temporary deals allow acp countries to export their products to europe without any customs duties , quotas or restrictions .
in return , acp countries will have to open their markets to european products .
rice and sugar would not be affected until 2010 and 2015 respectively .
parties to keep talking " there was commitment to continue with the negotiation process and implementation for the caribbean region , " said acp president william haome .
he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "
banana prices at issue one key demand from the acp countries is for europe to provide 500 million euros -lrb- $ 707 million -rrb- as compensation following an eu decision to lower customs duties for bananas coming from latin america .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acp countries fear latin american banana prices might go lower acp countries fear that european demand for their bananas will slump if latin american bananas cost less .
but talks have been dragging on in geneva between the world trade organization and the acp 's top banana producers , which are resisting lowering import tariffs for latin america .
" i find it especially important that together we recall the importance of maintaining an open , equitable and transparent trading system , especially in times of this economic crisis , and we call for an early , ambitious and balanced comprehensive agreement , " said eu commissioner olli rehn .
so , as is often the case with difficult negotiations in brussels , these meetings ended with positive statements and a promise from both sides to remain flexible .
diplomatic speak for " no one budged . "

while 96 countries have signed the treaty , including 20 of the 28 nato members , only seven countries have ratified it .
in order for the treaty to enter into force , it needs to be ratified by 30 nations .
within europe , germany , britain and the netherlands rank among the biggest stockpilers with a combined total of just under 96 million cluster bombs .
the country with the most bombs by far , 730 million , is the united states , which has not joined the treaty .
" the us is out of step with most of its major military allies , " says human rights watch arms division director steve goose .
attitudes changing a report posted on the human rights watch website notes that there has been " a major shift in global opinion about cluster munitions in recent years , with numerous former users and producers , exporters and stockpilers of the weapon now denouncing it because of the humanitarian harm it causes . "
cluster bombs are either shot from the ground or dropped from airplanes and explode in the air , scattering smaller munitions over an area the size of several football fields .
the munitions do n't explode on contact with the ground but can be detonated later with a mere touch , which makes them especially dangerous to civilians once a conflict has ended .
according to statistics , one third of all cluster bomb casualties are children .
currently seventeen countries , including the us , china , russia and brazil , produce cluster bombs .
the us has already banned their export and campaigners hope that president barack obama will now enroll the us in the treaty. av / reuters / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de over 100 states agree on landmark cluster bomb ban more than 100 governments have agreed on a draft convention to ban cluster bombs , which have killed and maimed tens of thousands of civilians .
but the treaty provides a loophole for resistant countries like the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 29.05.2009 eu , acp trade talks end in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no deal but parties remain flexible wrapping up two days of intense talks , officials from the european union and their counterparts from the african , caribbean and pacific region -lrb- acp -rrb- have agreed to remain flexible . with both sides standing firm on their positions , talks between the eu and members of the acp ended friday .
no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .
temporary deals allow acp countries to export their products to europe without any customs duties , quotas or restrictions .
in return , acp countries will have to open their markets to european products .
rice and sugar would not be affected until 2010 and 2015 respectively .
parties to keep talking " there was commitment to continue with the negotiation process and implementation for the caribbean region , " said acp president william haome .
he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "
banana prices at issue one key demand from the acp countries is for europe to provide 500 million euros -lrb- $ 707 million -rrb- as compensation following an eu decision to lower customs duties for bananas coming from latin america .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acp countries fear latin american banana prices might go lower acp countries fear that european demand for their bananas will slump if latin american bananas cost less .
but talks have been dragging on in geneva between the world trade organization and the acp 's top banana producers , which are resisting lowering import tariffs for latin america .
" i find it especially important that together we recall the importance of maintaining an open , equitable and transparent trading system , especially in times of this economic crisis , and we call for an early , ambitious and balanced comprehensive agreement , " said eu commissioner olli rehn .
so , as is often the case with difficult negotiations in brussels , these meetings ended with positive statements and a promise from both sides to remain flexible .
diplomatic speak for " no one budged . "

no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .
temporary deals allow acp countries to export their products to europe without any customs duties , quotas or restrictions .
in return , acp countries will have to open their markets to european products .
rice and sugar would not be affected until 2010 and 2015 respectively .
parties to keep talking " there was commitment to continue with the negotiation process and implementation for the caribbean region , " said acp president william haome .
he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "
banana prices at issue one key demand from the acp countries is for europe to provide 500 million euros -lrb- $ 707 million -rrb- as compensation following an eu decision to lower customs duties for bananas coming from latin america .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acp countries fear latin american banana prices might go lower acp countries fear that european demand for their bananas will slump if latin american bananas cost less .
but talks have been dragging on in geneva between the world trade organization and the acp 's top banana producers , which are resisting lowering import tariffs for latin america .
" i find it especially important that together we recall the importance of maintaining an open , equitable and transparent trading system , especially in times of this economic crisis , and we call for an early , ambitious and balanced comprehensive agreement , " said eu commissioner olli rehn .
so , as is often the case with difficult negotiations in brussels , these meetings ended with positive statements and a promise from both sides to remain flexible .

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .
that 's not to say that we 'll come to a decision today – it 's a plan that we 'll have to submit to some scrutiny , and should look over carefully . " deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .
ceo sergio marchionne said it was " unreasonable to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , " adding that it would expose his company to " unnecessary and unwarranted " risks . political math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister zu guttenberg has been one of berlin 's lead negotiators the unexpected new 300-million-euro request upset german government representatives , as well .
the north rhine-westphalia state premier called the negotiating tactic " unacceptable , " and guttenberg , the german economics minister , said he was strictly against providing any funds to gm until a deal has been finalized . " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .
he said an appraisal of gm 's assets six months ago showed its european operations comprised nearly half of the company 's worth , and berlin should n't expect the americans to give it away . " we ca n't expect charity , " said koch .
" there 's nobody over there who 's looking out for europe .
it 's simply in the concrete economic interest of gm to try and maintain a footprint in europe .
but , we do expect them to attempt to keep to our timetable .

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .
that 's not to say that we 'll come to a decision today – it 's a plan that we 'll have to submit to some scrutiny , and should look over carefully . " deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .
ceo sergio marchionne said it was " unreasonable to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , " adding that it would expose his company to " unnecessary and unwarranted " risks . political math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister zu guttenberg has been one of berlin 's lead negotiators the unexpected new 300-million-euro request upset german government representatives , as well .
the north rhine-westphalia state premier called the negotiating tactic " unacceptable , " and guttenberg , the german economics minister , said he was strictly against providing any funds to gm until a deal has been finalized . " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .
he said an appraisal of gm 's assets six months ago showed its european operations comprised nearly half of the company 's worth , and berlin should n't expect the americans to give it away . " we ca n't expect charity , " said koch .
" there 's nobody over there who 's looking out for europe .
it 's simply in the concrete economic interest of gm to try and maintain a footprint in europe .
but , we do expect them to attempt to keep to our timetable . " unease in brussels that germany has its own timetable and plan for opel , and that it is hoping to enforce it , has ruffled a few feathers in brussels , where european commission president jose manuel barroso presided over a discussion about the future of opel on friday . belgium , in particular , is upset that it has been left out of the decision-making process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 29.05.2009 eu , acp trade talks end in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no deal but parties remain flexible wrapping up two days of intense talks , officials from the european union and their counterparts from the african , caribbean and pacific region -lrb- acp -rrb- have agreed to remain flexible . with both sides standing firm on their positions , talks between the eu and members of the acp ended friday .
no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .
temporary deals allow acp countries to export their products to europe without any customs duties , quotas or restrictions .
in return , acp countries will have to open their markets to european products .
rice and sugar would not be affected until 2010 and 2015 respectively .
parties to keep talking " there was commitment to continue with the negotiation process and implementation for the caribbean region , " said acp president william haome .
he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "
banana prices at issue one key demand from the acp countries is for europe to provide 500 million euros -lrb- $ 707 million -rrb- as compensation following an eu decision to lower customs duties for bananas coming from latin america .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acp countries fear latin american banana prices might go lower acp countries fear that european demand for their bananas will slump if latin american bananas cost less .
but talks have been dragging on in geneva between the world trade organization and the acp 's top banana producers , which are resisting lowering import tariffs for latin america .
" i find it especially important that together we recall the importance of maintaining an open , equitable and transparent trading system , especially in times of this economic crisis , and we call for an early , ambitious and balanced comprehensive agreement , " said eu commissioner olli rehn .
so , as is often the case with difficult negotiations in brussels , these meetings ended with positive statements and a promise from both sides to remain flexible .
diplomatic speak for " no one budged . "

but recent spats between gas supplier russia and transit country ukraine have left some european countries in the cold .
some nations , including slovakia and its neighbor the czech republic , now think nuclear power may free them from their dependence on russian natural gas .
state-run companies from the czech republic and slovakia announced plans on friday to build a new nuclear reactor in jaslovske bohunice on the site of the old soviet power generator that was shut down last december .
the deal that was signed between czech energy company cez as and slovak state energy firm javys as will set up a joint-stock company to construct a new 100 billion koruny -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- reactor .
javys as will have a 51 percent stake while cez will control 49 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak prime minister robert fico does n't rule out starting up an old reactor no further details were provided , but a feasibility study , due to be completed by 2010 , will provide a timetable for the project .
as recently as this january , slovak officials threatened to re-start the old soviet reactor when gas supplies to several european union countries were halted because of a price dispute between russia and the ukraine .
no guarantees and slovakia still wo n't guarantee not to start the old reactor up again .
" i can not rule it out , " said slovak prime minister robert fico after the european nuclear energy forum in prague . " if there was such a threat in slovakia , it is more important to have light and warmth than dark and cold . "
both the czech and slovak republics are among the biggest proponents of nuclear power .
according to the world nuclear association , slovakia currently has five nuclear generators , which provide half of the country 's electricity , with two more under construction .
the czech republic has six nuclear plants which supply one third of its electricity. av / afp / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 29.05.2009 fiat pulls out of second opel meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must find a suitor for opel before gm files for bankruptcy german officials hold further talks with gm and the last remaining bidder , magna , to decide the future of opel .
if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .
eu industry commissioner günther verheugen said that a meeting being held in brussels on friday was a chance for german officials to update their eu counterparts as to what measures are being considered to prop up opel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is in the pole position after fiat dropped out of friday 's meeting meanwhile in berlin , the planned friday meeting between german officials and representatives of magna and gm was suddenly postponed for several hours .
media reports quoting german government officials now say that austrian-canadian car parts supplier magna has reached a preliminary agreement with general motors on the terms of a takeover of opel. dpa news agency reports that german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier mediated the agreement during talks with magna chief executive frank stronach . a number of questions remain unresolved , however , including the appointment of a board of trustees to oversee opel - a move demanded by berlin but opposed by the us administration glb / dpa / afp / reuters / bloomberg editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .
that 's not to say that we 'll come to a decision today – it 's a plan that we 'll have to submit to some scrutiny , and should look over carefully . " deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .
ceo sergio marchionne said it was " unreasonable to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , " adding that it would expose his company to " unnecessary and unwarranted " risks . political math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister zu guttenberg has been one of berlin 's lead negotiators the unexpected new 300-million-euro request upset german government representatives , as well .
the north rhine-westphalia state premier called the negotiating tactic " unacceptable , " and guttenberg , the german economics minister , said he was strictly against providing any funds to gm until a deal has been finalized . " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .
he said an appraisal of gm 's assets six months ago showed its european operations comprised nearly half of the company 's worth , and berlin should n't expect the americans to give it away . " we ca n't expect charity , " said koch .
" there 's nobody over there who 's looking out for europe .
it 's simply in the concrete economic interest of gm to try and maintain a footprint in europe .
but , we do expect them to attempt to keep to our timetable . " unease in brussels that germany has its own timetable and plan for opel , and that it is hoping to enforce it , has ruffled a few feathers in brussels , where european commission president jose manuel barroso presided over a discussion about the future of opel on friday . belgium , in particular , is upset that it has been left out of the decision-making process .
it believes berlin is looking after the future of its opel plants , and is going to show less concern for those in belgium and elsewhere in europe . german deputy economics minister peter hintze , who represented guttenberg in the discussions in the belgian capital , tried to allay their concerns , saying the german government was pursuing " a european strategy , " and that any forthcoming financing from the german government could be spent on any work site in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 29.05.2009 fiat pulls out of second opel meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must find a suitor for opel before gm files for bankruptcy german officials hold further talks with gm and the last remaining bidder , magna , to decide the future of opel .
if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .
eu industry commissioner günther verheugen said that a meeting being held in brussels on friday was a chance for german officials to update their eu counterparts as to what measures are being considered to prop up opel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is in the pole position after fiat dropped out of friday 's meeting meanwhile in berlin , the planned friday meeting between german officials and representatives of magna and gm was suddenly postponed for several hours .
media reports quoting german government officials now say that austrian-canadian car parts supplier magna has reached a preliminary agreement with general motors on the terms of a takeover of opel. dpa news agency reports that german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier mediated the agreement during talks with magna chief executive frank stronach . a number of questions remain unresolved , however , including the appointment of a board of trustees to oversee opel - a move demanded by berlin but opposed by the us administration glb / dpa / afp / reuters / bloomberg editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .

he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .

the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 29.05.2009 fiat pulls out of second opel meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must find a suitor for opel before gm files for bankruptcy german officials hold further talks with gm and the last remaining bidder , magna , to decide the future of opel .
if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .
eu industry commissioner günther verheugen said that a meeting being held in brussels on friday was a chance for german officials to update their eu counterparts as to what measures are being considered to prop up opel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is in the pole position after fiat dropped out of friday 's meeting meanwhile in berlin , the planned friday meeting between german officials and representatives of magna and gm was suddenly postponed for several hours .

but recent spats between gas supplier russia and transit country ukraine have left some european countries in the cold .
some nations , including slovakia and its neighbor the czech republic , now think nuclear power may free them from their dependence on russian natural gas .
state-run companies from the czech republic and slovakia announced plans on friday to build a new nuclear reactor in jaslovske bohunice on the site of the old soviet power generator that was shut down last december .
the deal that was signed between czech energy company cez as and slovak state energy firm javys as will set up a joint-stock company to construct a new 100 billion koruny -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- reactor .
javys as will have a 51 percent stake while cez will control 49 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak prime minister robert fico does n't rule out starting up an old reactor no further details were provided , but a feasibility study , due to be completed by 2010 , will provide a timetable for the project .
as recently as this january , slovak officials threatened to re-start the old soviet reactor when gas supplies to several european union countries were halted because of a price dispute between russia and the ukraine .
no guarantees and slovakia still wo n't guarantee not to start the old reactor up again .
" i can not rule it out , " said slovak prime minister robert fico after the european nuclear energy forum in prague . " if there was such a threat in slovakia , it is more important to have light and warmth than dark and cold . "
both the czech and slovak republics are among the biggest proponents of nuclear power .
according to the world nuclear association , slovakia currently has five nuclear generators , which provide half of the country 's electricity , with two more under construction .
the czech republic has six nuclear plants which supply one third of its electricity. av / afp / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the national teams will be disbanded until each member is deemed fit to return to competition by the federation and the olympic committee .
“ together with the german olympic committee we have decided that our national teams in the events show-jumping , dressage and three-day should be disbanded with immediate effect , " said sönke lauterbach , the federation 's general secretary .
“ those who wish to perform for the national teams in the future will have to appear before and be examined by a special commission .

the commission is to probe the teams ' doping practices and also the attitudes of the riders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 29.05.2009 eu says it 's on its way to meeting kyoto emission reduction goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu countries have cut their greenhous gas emissions , but are individual europeans doing enough ?
the european union says it 's on track to meet kyoto greenhouse gas reduction goals , but the prospects of it meeting its own more ambitious targets are less rosy . the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas is confident that eu countries will meet kyoto protocol goals of reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
the eu-15 -lrb- the 15 nations that made up the eu when kyoto was agreed upon -rrb- cut emissions by 1.6 percent in 2007 , bringing their total reductions to 5 percent below 1990 levels .
the eu-27 , which includes the 12 countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 , cut emissions by 1.2 percent , bringing their total to 9.3 percent below 1990 levels .
while the 12 newest eu countries are not bound to eu-wide kyoto promises , all member states , with the exception of cyprus and malta , are bound to individual reduction goals .
this latest drop " gives us confidence that we will successfully reach our kyoto target , " dimas said in a statement on friday .
" the proactive climate policies and measures taken nationally and at eu level since kyoto are starting to pay off . "
cuts may not be as significant as they sound the eu 's own report admits that the eu-15 reductions were due mainly to a warmer winter and industry reductions , which suggests that european citizens have not changed their energy-consumption habits .
new figures released by the copenhagen-based european environmental agency -lrb- eea -rrb- indicate that eu policies have had little effect on car and household emissions , which make up a quarter of the bloc 's total greenhouse gas output .
with kyoto set to expire in 2012 , the bigger issue may be whether the eu can meet its own greenhouse gas reduction targets .
in march 2007 the eu agreed to cut emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
united nations talks scheduled to take plan in copenhagen later this year are intended to produce a climate change agreement to replace kyoto. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de carbon capture could help world meet emissions targets as talks on technology 's role in fighting climate change begin in norway , many see carbon capture technology as a way of helping the environment .
it 's permitted in germany , but environmentalists are critical of the plan .
-lrb- 27.05.2009 -rrb- little progress made in talks ahead of copenhagen politicians at a pair of international conferences stressed the importance of fighting climate change .
but they could n't agree on the best path forward and germany 's environment minster says disaster looms .
-lrb- 26.05.2009 -rrb- germany prepares for mediterranean climate climate change is likely to offer a relatively kind fate to germany , but the country is already preparing for the mixed-bag in store .
rising temperatures could prove problematic to some while others could benefit .

the european union says it 's on track to meet kyoto greenhouse gas reduction goals , but the prospects of it meeting its own more ambitious targets are less rosy . the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas is confident that eu countries will meet kyoto protocol goals of reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .

but recent spats between gas supplier russia and transit country ukraine have left some european countries in the cold .
some nations , including slovakia and its neighbor the czech republic , now think nuclear power may free them from their dependence on russian natural gas .
state-run companies from the czech republic and slovakia announced plans on friday to build a new nuclear reactor in jaslovske bohunice on the site of the old soviet power generator that was shut down last december .
the deal that was signed between czech energy company cez as and slovak state energy firm javys as will set up a joint-stock company to construct a new 100 billion koruny -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- reactor .
javys as will have a 51 percent stake while cez will control 49 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak prime minister robert fico does n't rule out starting up an old reactor no further details were provided , but a feasibility study , due to be completed by 2010 , will provide a timetable for the project .
as recently as this january , slovak officials threatened to re-start the old soviet reactor when gas supplies to several european union countries were halted because of a price dispute between russia and the ukraine .
no guarantees and slovakia still wo n't guarantee not to start the old reactor up again .
" i can not rule it out , " said slovak prime minister robert fico after the european nuclear energy forum in prague . " if there was such a threat in slovakia , it is more important to have light and warmth than dark and cold . "
both the czech and slovak republics are among the biggest proponents of nuclear power .
according to the world nuclear association , slovakia currently has five nuclear generators , which provide half of the country 's electricity , with two more under construction .
the czech republic has six nuclear plants which supply one third of its electricity. av / afp / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .
that 's not to say that we 'll come to a decision today – it 's a plan that we 'll have to submit to some scrutiny , and should look over carefully . " deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .
ceo sergio marchionne said it was " unreasonable to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , " adding that it would expose his company to " unnecessary and unwarranted " risks . political math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister zu guttenberg has been one of berlin 's lead negotiators the unexpected new 300-million-euro request upset german government representatives , as well .
the north rhine-westphalia state premier called the negotiating tactic " unacceptable , " and guttenberg , the german economics minister , said he was strictly against providing any funds to gm until a deal has been finalized . " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .
he said an appraisal of gm 's assets six months ago showed its european operations comprised nearly half of the company 's worth , and berlin should n't expect the americans to give it away . " we ca n't expect charity , " said koch .
" there 's nobody over there who 's looking out for europe .
it 's simply in the concrete economic interest of gm to try and maintain a footprint in europe .
but , we do expect them to attempt to keep to our timetable . " unease in brussels that germany has its own timetable and plan for opel , and that it is hoping to enforce it , has ruffled a few feathers in brussels , where european commission president jose manuel barroso presided over a discussion about the future of opel on friday . belgium , in particular , is upset that it has been left out of the decision-making process .
it believes berlin is looking after the future of its opel plants , and is going to show less concern for those in belgium and elsewhere in europe . german deputy economics minister peter hintze , who represented guttenberg in the discussions in the belgian capital , tried to allay their concerns , saying the german government was pursuing " a european strategy , " and that any forthcoming financing from the german government could be spent on any work site in europe . " what we are doing will have a positive effect for all of europe , " he said . author : matt hermann editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the national teams will be disbanded until each member is deemed fit to return to competition by the federation and the olympic committee .
“ together with the german olympic committee we have decided that our national teams in the events show-jumping , dressage and three-day should be disbanded with immediate effect , " said sönke lauterbach , the federation 's general secretary .
“ those who wish to perform for the national teams in the future will have to appear before and be examined by a special commission .
we 've established this independent commission to give german equestrian sport a new beginning and to create a way to control the use of doping substances in the future , ” he added .
the commission is to probe the teams ' doping practices and also the attitudes of the riders .
until the riders have faced the commission , germany will remain without a national team , lauterbach said .
“ this means , at least for the moment , that we simply wo n't have a national team , " he explained .
" once the commission gets up and running and begins its work , at least for the next few months we wo n't be able to reinstate the riders .
for that time , we will be without a team . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beerbaum has been germany 's top rider for over two decades top rider published confession leading up to the 2008 beijing games , where germany won three gold , one silver , and one bronze , german teams tested positive for several forbidden medications .
though that in itself does n't lead to sanctions , or to the medals being withdrawn , the german equestrian federation decided to implement the sanctions after its undisputed top rider , olympic gold medalist ludger beerbaum , admitted to years of “ dubious practices ” in a newspaper interview published two weeks ago .
in the interview , beerbaum was quoted as saying he previously had the attitude that " anything that was n't found out was allowed . ”
in response , the national federation suspended him from team events indefinitely .
however , otto becker , germany 's national trainer , is confident that beerbaum will return to competition in the near future .
“ i 've spoken with him and i get the impression that he accepts the decision .
he told me he wants to clear up the situation as soon as possible .
he is very optimistic and says he just wants to get the facts straight and give the public his side of the story .
i think that , once this is all over , he 'll return to active competition , for many years to come , " becker said .
the federation has yet to comment on whether it will reinstate its riders in time to compete in events later this year .

no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .

he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 29.05.2009 fiat pulls out of second opel meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must find a suitor for opel before gm files for bankruptcy german officials hold further talks with gm and the last remaining bidder , magna , to decide the future of opel .
if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .
eu industry commissioner günther verheugen said that a meeting being held in brussels on friday was a chance for german officials to update their eu counterparts as to what measures are being considered to prop up opel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is in the pole position after fiat dropped out of friday 's meeting meanwhile in berlin , the planned friday meeting between german officials and representatives of magna and gm was suddenly postponed for several hours .
media reports quoting german government officials now say that austrian-canadian car parts supplier magna has reached a preliminary agreement with general motors on the terms of a takeover of opel. dpa news agency reports that german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier mediated the agreement during talks with magna chief executive frank stronach . a number of questions remain unresolved , however , including the appointment of a board of trustees to oversee opel - a move demanded by berlin but opposed by the us administration glb / dpa / afp / reuters / bloomberg editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .
eu industry commissioner günther verheugen said that a meeting being held in brussels on friday was a chance for german officials to update their eu counterparts as to what measures are being considered to prop up opel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is in the pole position after fiat dropped out of friday 's meeting meanwhile in berlin , the planned friday meeting between german officials and representatives of magna and gm was suddenly postponed for several hours .
media reports quoting german government officials now say that austrian-canadian car parts supplier magna has reached a preliminary agreement with general motors on the terms of a takeover of opel. dpa news agency reports that german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier mediated the agreement during talks with magna chief executive frank stronach . a number of questions remain unresolved , however , including the appointment of a board of trustees to oversee opel - a move demanded by berlin but opposed by the us administration glb / dpa / afp / reuters / bloomberg editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .
that 's not to say that we 'll come to a decision today – it 's a plan that we 'll have to submit to some scrutiny , and should look over carefully . " deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .
ceo sergio marchionne said it was " unreasonable to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , " adding that it would expose his company to " unnecessary and unwarranted " risks . political math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister zu guttenberg has been one of berlin 's lead negotiators the unexpected new 300-million-euro request upset german government representatives , as well .
the north rhine-westphalia state premier called the negotiating tactic " unacceptable , " and guttenberg , the german economics minister , said he was strictly against providing any funds to gm until a deal has been finalized . " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .
he said an appraisal of gm 's assets six months ago showed its european operations comprised nearly half of the company 's worth , and berlin should n't expect the americans to give it away . " we ca n't expect charity , " said koch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 29.05.2009 fiat pulls out of second opel meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must find a suitor for opel before gm files for bankruptcy german officials hold further talks with gm and the last remaining bidder , magna , to decide the future of opel .
if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .
eu industry commissioner günther verheugen said that a meeting being held in brussels on friday was a chance for german officials to update their eu counterparts as to what measures are being considered to prop up opel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is in the pole position after fiat dropped out of friday 's meeting meanwhile in berlin , the planned friday meeting between german officials and representatives of magna and gm was suddenly postponed for several hours .
media reports quoting german government officials now say that austrian-canadian car parts supplier magna has reached a preliminary agreement with general motors on the terms of a takeover of opel. dpa news agency reports that german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier mediated the agreement during talks with magna chief executive frank stronach . a number of questions remain unresolved , however , including the appointment of a board of trustees to oversee opel - a move demanded by berlin but opposed by the us administration glb / dpa / afp / reuters / bloomberg editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .
that 's not to say that we 'll come to a decision today – it 's a plan that we 'll have to submit to some scrutiny , and should look over carefully . " deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .
ceo sergio marchionne said it was " unreasonable to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , " adding that it would expose his company to " unnecessary and unwarranted " risks . political math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister zu guttenberg has been one of berlin 's lead negotiators the unexpected new 300-million-euro request upset german government representatives , as well .
the north rhine-westphalia state premier called the negotiating tactic " unacceptable , " and guttenberg , the german economics minister , said he was strictly against providing any funds to gm until a deal has been finalized . " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .
he said an appraisal of gm 's assets six months ago showed its european operations comprised nearly half of the company 's worth , and berlin should n't expect the americans to give it away . " we ca n't expect charity , " said koch .
" there 's nobody over there who 's looking out for europe .
it 's simply in the concrete economic interest of gm to try and maintain a footprint in europe .
but , we do expect them to attempt to keep to our timetable .

no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .

he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acp countries fear latin american banana prices might go lower acp countries fear that european demand for their bananas will slump if latin american bananas cost less .
but talks have been dragging on in geneva between the world trade organization and the acp 's top banana producers , which are resisting lowering import tariffs for latin america .
" i find it especially important that together we recall the importance of maintaining an open , equitable and transparent trading system , especially in times of this economic crisis , and we call for an early , ambitious and balanced comprehensive agreement , " said eu commissioner olli rehn .
so , as is often the case with difficult negotiations in brussels , these meetings ended with positive statements and a promise from both sides to remain flexible .

no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .
temporary deals allow acp countries to export their products to europe without any customs duties , quotas or restrictions .
in return , acp countries will have to open their markets to european products .
rice and sugar would not be affected until 2010 and 2015 respectively .
parties to keep talking " there was commitment to continue with the negotiation process and implementation for the caribbean region , " said acp president william haome .
he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "
banana prices at issue one key demand from the acp countries is for europe to provide 500 million euros -lrb- $ 707 million -rrb- as compensation following an eu decision to lower customs duties for bananas coming from latin america .

if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .

the european union says it 's on track to meet kyoto greenhouse gas reduction goals , but the prospects of it meeting its own more ambitious targets are less rosy . the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas is confident that eu countries will meet kyoto protocol goals of reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
the eu-15 -lrb- the 15 nations that made up the eu when kyoto was agreed upon -rrb- cut emissions by 1.6 percent in 2007 , bringing their total reductions to 5 percent below 1990 levels .

while 96 countries have signed the treaty , including 20 of the 28 nato members , only seven countries have ratified it .
in order for the treaty to enter into force , it needs to be ratified by 30 nations .
within europe , germany , britain and the netherlands rank among the biggest stockpilers with a combined total of just under 96 million cluster bombs .
the country with the most bombs by far , 730 million , is the united states , which has not joined the treaty .
" the us is out of step with most of its major military allies , " says human rights watch arms division director steve goose .
attitudes changing a report posted on the human rights watch website notes that there has been " a major shift in global opinion about cluster munitions in recent years , with numerous former users and producers , exporters and stockpilers of the weapon now denouncing it because of the humanitarian harm it causes . "
cluster bombs are either shot from the ground or dropped from airplanes and explode in the air , scattering smaller munitions over an area the size of several football fields .
the munitions do n't explode on contact with the ground but can be detonated later with a mere touch , which makes them especially dangerous to civilians once a conflict has ended .
according to statistics , one third of all cluster bomb casualties are children .
currently seventeen countries , including the us , china , russia and brazil , produce cluster bombs .
the us has already banned their export and campaigners hope that president barack obama will now enroll the us in the treaty. av / reuters / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 29.05.2009 eu , acp trade talks end in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no deal but parties remain flexible wrapping up two days of intense talks , officials from the european union and their counterparts from the african , caribbean and pacific region -lrb- acp -rrb- have agreed to remain flexible . with both sides standing firm on their positions , talks between the eu and members of the acp ended friday .
no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .
temporary deals allow acp countries to export their products to europe without any customs duties , quotas or restrictions .
in return , acp countries will have to open their markets to european products .
rice and sugar would not be affected until 2010 and 2015 respectively .
parties to keep talking " there was commitment to continue with the negotiation process and implementation for the caribbean region , " said acp president william haome .
he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "
banana prices at issue one key demand from the acp countries is for europe to provide 500 million euros -lrb- $ 707 million -rrb- as compensation following an eu decision to lower customs duties for bananas coming from latin america .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acp countries fear latin american banana prices might go lower acp countries fear that european demand for their bananas will slump if latin american bananas cost less .
but talks have been dragging on in geneva between the world trade organization and the acp 's top banana producers , which are resisting lowering import tariffs for latin america .
" i find it especially important that together we recall the importance of maintaining an open , equitable and transparent trading system , especially in times of this economic crisis , and we call for an early , ambitious and balanced comprehensive agreement , " said eu commissioner olli rehn .
so , as is often the case with difficult negotiations in brussels , these meetings ended with positive statements and a promise from both sides to remain flexible .
diplomatic speak for " no one budged . "

if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .

he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .

the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .

“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .

but recent spats between gas supplier russia and transit country ukraine have left some european countries in the cold .
some nations , including slovakia and its neighbor the czech republic , now think nuclear power may free them from their dependence on russian natural gas .
state-run companies from the czech republic and slovakia announced plans on friday to build a new nuclear reactor in jaslovske bohunice on the site of the old soviet power generator that was shut down last december .
the deal that was signed between czech energy company cez as and slovak state energy firm javys as will set up a joint-stock company to construct a new 100 billion koruny -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- reactor .
javys as will have a 51 percent stake while cez will control 49 percent .

as recently as this january , slovak officials threatened to re-start the old soviet reactor when gas supplies to several european union countries were halted because of a price dispute between russia and the ukraine .
no guarantees and slovakia still wo n't guarantee not to start the old reactor up again .
" i can not rule it out , " said slovak prime minister robert fico after the european nuclear energy forum in prague . " if there was such a threat in slovakia , it is more important to have light and warmth than dark and cold . "
both the czech and slovak republics are among the biggest proponents of nuclear power .
according to the world nuclear association , slovakia currently has five nuclear generators , which provide half of the country 's electricity , with two more under construction .
the czech republic has six nuclear plants which supply one third of its electricity. av / afp / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no one was expecting any major breakthroughs and ending the meetings on a positive note was in itself seen as progress .
however , with regard to the two most important subjects , the economic partnership agreements -lrb- epas -rrb- and bananas , little was achieved . still , the eu hopes that it might be able to sign a few epas with acp countries like botswana before the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african leaders are hoping increased trade will help their countries ' economies " we expressed our openness to applying a new and flexible approach to the negotiation of epas to build confidence between the eu and acp countries , " said deputy czech foreign minister helena bambasova , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
thus far , only ghana , the ivory coast and cameroon have signed some partial agreements on goods .

he also noted that one key demand is that no country should be worse off at the end of the process .
the economic crisis , however , has significantly complicated negotiations because the developing countries want the eu to commit more financial aid in case the crisis can not be reversed .
" in the low income countries and particularly for acp states , " said haome , " the impact of the crisis poses problems for health and education , etc . , due to the increasing number of poor people and the worsening hunger situation . "

but talks have been dragging on in geneva between the world trade organization and the acp 's top banana producers , which are resisting lowering import tariffs for latin america .
" i find it especially important that together we recall the importance of maintaining an open , equitable and transparent trading system , especially in times of this economic crisis , and we call for an early , ambitious and balanced comprehensive agreement , " said eu commissioner olli rehn .
so , as is often the case with difficult negotiations in brussels , these meetings ended with positive statements and a promise from both sides to remain flexible .

the european union says it 's on track to meet kyoto greenhouse gas reduction goals , but the prospects of it meeting its own more ambitious targets are less rosy . the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas is confident that eu countries will meet kyoto protocol goals of reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
the eu-15 -lrb- the 15 nations that made up the eu when kyoto was agreed upon -rrb- cut emissions by 1.6 percent in 2007 , bringing their total reductions to 5 percent below 1990 levels .
the eu-27 , which includes the 12 countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 , cut emissions by 1.2 percent , bringing their total to 9.3 percent below 1990 levels .

this latest drop " gives us confidence that we will successfully reach our kyoto target , " dimas said in a statement on friday .
" the proactive climate policies and measures taken nationally and at eu level since kyoto are starting to pay off . "
cuts may not be as significant as they sound the eu 's own report admits that the eu-15 reductions were due mainly to a warmer winter and industry reductions , which suggests that european citizens have not changed their energy-consumption habits .
new figures released by the copenhagen-based european environmental agency -lrb- eea -rrb- indicate that eu policies have had little effect on car and household emissions , which make up a quarter of the bloc 's total greenhouse gas output .
with kyoto set to expire in 2012 , the bigger issue may be whether the eu can meet its own greenhouse gas reduction targets .

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .
that 's not to say that we 'll come to a decision today – it 's a plan that we 'll have to submit to some scrutiny , and should look over carefully . " deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .
ceo sergio marchionne said it was " unreasonable to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , " adding that it would expose his company to " unnecessary and unwarranted " risks . political math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister zu guttenberg has been one of berlin 's lead negotiators the unexpected new 300-million-euro request upset german government representatives , as well .
the north rhine-westphalia state premier called the negotiating tactic " unacceptable , " and guttenberg , the german economics minister , said he was strictly against providing any funds to gm until a deal has been finalized . " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .
he said an appraisal of gm 's assets six months ago showed its european operations comprised nearly half of the company 's worth , and berlin should n't expect the americans to give it away . " we ca n't expect charity , " said koch .
" there 's nobody over there who 's looking out for europe .
it 's simply in the concrete economic interest of gm to try and maintain a footprint in europe .
but , we do expect them to attempt to keep to our timetable . " unease in brussels that germany has its own timetable and plan for opel , and that it is hoping to enforce it , has ruffled a few feathers in brussels , where european commission president jose manuel barroso presided over a discussion about the future of opel on friday . belgium , in particular , is upset that it has been left out of the decision-making process .

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .
that 's not to say that we 'll come to a decision today – it 's a plan that we 'll have to submit to some scrutiny , and should look over carefully . " deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .
ceo sergio marchionne said it was " unreasonable to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , " adding that it would expose his company to " unnecessary and unwarranted " risks . political math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister zu guttenberg has been one of berlin 's lead negotiators the unexpected new 300-million-euro request upset german government representatives , as well .
the north rhine-westphalia state premier called the negotiating tactic " unacceptable , " and guttenberg , the german economics minister , said he was strictly against providing any funds to gm until a deal has been finalized . " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .
he said an appraisal of gm 's assets six months ago showed its european operations comprised nearly half of the company 's worth , and berlin should n't expect the americans to give it away . " we ca n't expect charity , " said koch .
" there 's nobody over there who 's looking out for europe .
it 's simply in the concrete economic interest of gm to try and maintain a footprint in europe .
but , we do expect them to attempt to keep to our timetable . " unease in brussels that germany has its own timetable and plan for opel , and that it is hoping to enforce it , has ruffled a few feathers in brussels , where european commission president jose manuel barroso presided over a discussion about the future of opel on friday . belgium , in particular , is upset that it has been left out of the decision-making process .

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .
that 's not to say that we 'll come to a decision today – it 's a plan that we 'll have to submit to some scrutiny , and should look over carefully . " deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .
it was a request that drove fiat from the negotiating table .
ceo sergio marchionne said it was " unreasonable to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , " adding that it would expose his company to " unnecessary and unwarranted " risks . political math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister zu guttenberg has been one of berlin 's lead negotiators the unexpected new 300-million-euro request upset german government representatives , as well .
the north rhine-westphalia state premier called the negotiating tactic " unacceptable , " and guttenberg , the german economics minister , said he was strictly against providing any funds to gm until a deal has been finalized . " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . " another politician , roland koch , who is premier of the german state where opel is headquartered , said , however , that for him , such hardball tactics reinforced how valuable opel was .
he said an appraisal of gm 's assets six months ago showed its european operations comprised nearly half of the company 's worth , and berlin should n't expect the americans to give it away . " we ca n't expect charity , " said koch .
" there 's nobody over there who 's looking out for europe .
it 's simply in the concrete economic interest of gm to try and maintain a footprint in europe .
but , we do expect them to attempt to keep to our timetable . " unease in brussels that germany has its own timetable and plan for opel , and that it is hoping to enforce it , has ruffled a few feathers in brussels , where european commission president jose manuel barroso presided over a discussion about the future of opel on friday . belgium , in particular , is upset that it has been left out of the decision-making process .
it believes berlin is looking after the future of its opel plants , and is going to show less concern for those in belgium and elsewhere in europe . german deputy economics minister peter hintze , who represented guttenberg in the discussions in the belgian capital , tried to allay their concerns , saying the german government was pursuing " a european strategy , " and that any forthcoming financing from the german government could be spent on any work site in europe . " what we are doing will have a positive effect for all of europe , " he said . author : matt hermann editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 29.05.2009 fiat pulls out of second opel meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must find a suitor for opel before gm files for bankruptcy german officials hold further talks with gm and the last remaining bidder , magna , to decide the future of opel .
if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .
eu industry commissioner günther verheugen said that a meeting being held in brussels on friday was a chance for german officials to update their eu counterparts as to what measures are being considered to prop up opel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is in the pole position after fiat dropped out of friday 's meeting meanwhile in berlin , the planned friday meeting between german officials and representatives of magna and gm was suddenly postponed for several hours .
media reports quoting german government officials now say that austrian-canadian car parts supplier magna has reached a preliminary agreement with general motors on the terms of a takeover of opel. dpa news agency reports that german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier mediated the agreement during talks with magna chief executive frank stronach . a number of questions remain unresolved , however , including the appointment of a board of trustees to oversee opel - a move demanded by berlin but opposed by the us administration glb / dpa / afp / reuters / bloomberg editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .

the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .

“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .

the european union says it 's on track to meet kyoto greenhouse gas reduction goals , but the prospects of it meeting its own more ambitious targets are less rosy . the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas is confident that eu countries will meet kyoto protocol goals of reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
the eu-15 -lrb- the 15 nations that made up the eu when kyoto was agreed upon -rrb- cut emissions by 1.6 percent in 2007 , bringing their total reductions to 5 percent below 1990 levels .
the eu-27 , which includes the 12 countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 , cut emissions by 1.2 percent , bringing their total to 9.3 percent below 1990 levels .
while the 12 newest eu countries are not bound to eu-wide kyoto promises , all member states , with the exception of cyprus and malta , are bound to individual reduction goals .
this latest drop " gives us confidence that we will successfully reach our kyoto target , " dimas said in a statement on friday .
" the proactive climate policies and measures taken nationally and at eu level since kyoto are starting to pay off . "
cuts may not be as significant as they sound the eu 's own report admits that the eu-15 reductions were due mainly to a warmer winter and industry reductions , which suggests that european citizens have not changed their energy-consumption habits .
new figures released by the copenhagen-based european environmental agency -lrb- eea -rrb- indicate that eu policies have had little effect on car and household emissions , which make up a quarter of the bloc 's total greenhouse gas output .

if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .
eu industry commissioner günther verheugen said that a meeting being held in brussels on friday was a chance for german officials to update their eu counterparts as to what measures are being considered to prop up opel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is in the pole position after fiat dropped out of friday 's meeting meanwhile in berlin , the planned friday meeting between german officials and representatives of magna and gm was suddenly postponed for several hours .

the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .
eu industry commissioner günther verheugen said that a meeting being held in brussels on friday was a chance for german officials to update their eu counterparts as to what measures are being considered to prop up opel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is in the pole position after fiat dropped out of friday 's meeting meanwhile in berlin , the planned friday meeting between german officials and representatives of magna and gm was suddenly postponed for several hours .
media reports quoting german government officials now say that austrian-canadian car parts supplier magna has reached a preliminary agreement with general motors on the terms of a takeover of opel. dpa news agency reports that german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier mediated the agreement during talks with magna chief executive frank stronach . a number of questions remain unresolved , however , including the appointment of a board of trustees to oversee opel - a move demanded by berlin but opposed by the us administration glb / dpa / afp / reuters / bloomberg editor : chuck penfold / susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the national teams will be disbanded until each member is deemed fit to return to competition by the federation and the olympic committee .
“ together with the german olympic committee we have decided that our national teams in the events show-jumping , dressage and three-day should be disbanded with immediate effect , " said sönke lauterbach , the federation 's general secretary .
“ those who wish to perform for the national teams in the future will have to appear before and be examined by a special commission .
we 've established this independent commission to give german equestrian sport a new beginning and to create a way to control the use of doping substances in the future , ” he added .
the commission is to probe the teams ' doping practices and also the attitudes of the riders .
until the riders have faced the commission , germany will remain without a national team , lauterbach said .
“ this means , at least for the moment , that we simply wo n't have a national team , " he explained .
" once the commission gets up and running and begins its work , at least for the next few months we wo n't be able to reinstate the riders .
for that time , we will be without a team . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beerbaum has been germany 's top rider for over two decades top rider published confession leading up to the 2008 beijing games , where germany won three gold , one silver , and one bronze , german teams tested positive for several forbidden medications .
though that in itself does n't lead to sanctions , or to the medals being withdrawn , the german equestrian federation decided to implement the sanctions after its undisputed top rider , olympic gold medalist ludger beerbaum , admitted to years of “ dubious practices ” in a newspaper interview published two weeks ago .
in the interview , beerbaum was quoted as saying he previously had the attitude that " anything that was n't found out was allowed . ”
in response , the national federation suspended him from team events indefinitely .
however , otto becker , germany 's national trainer , is confident that beerbaum will return to competition in the near future .
“ i 've spoken with him and i get the impression that he accepts the decision .
he told me he wants to clear up the situation as soon as possible .
he is very optimistic and says he just wants to get the facts straight and give the public his side of the story .
i think that , once this is all over , he 'll return to active competition , for many years to come , " becker said .
the federation has yet to comment on whether it will reinstate its riders in time to compete in events later this year .

if it is willing to cover the funds gm asked for on wednesday , it seems magna will take over opel . the italian carmaker fiat said in a statement on friday that it was suspending talks with the german government over its bid for opel and that it would not be in attendance at the emergency meeting in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchionne backed out of the talks friday but said fiat was still interested ceo sergio marchionne said it was “ unreasonable ” to provide opel with emergency funds while the government decides the timing and conditions of that financing , ” adding that it would expose his company to “ unnecessary and unwarranted ” risks .
he did say , however , that his company was still interested in taking over gm 's european unit .
the feud over 300 million euros leading into wednesday 's first meeting , which ended acrimoniously and without results , germany was set to make a decision on which company it thought should take over opel , but negotiators were shocked when gm began the meeting by asking for an extra 300 million euros -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- in loans .
germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .

the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .

“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .

germany had already promised to provide 1.5 billion euros to cover opel 's split from its parent company gm .
gm ceo fritz henderson said on thursday that the request had nothing to do with “ extra ” funding .
he said gm needed the funds up front , which were to come from the promised 1.5 billion euros , to keep opel afloat while a takeover deal was finalized .
however , germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is strictly against providing funds to gm until a deal has been finalized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg was n't happy with gm 's surprise demand " the goal of the americans is to get as much money as they can from the europeans , " guttenberg said in an interview broadcast on german public television on thursday .
" my goal is to prevent german taxpayers ' money from flowing to the united states . ”
the us dismissed the claims , with a treasury spokesman saying that it did n't want american taxpayers ' dollars being spent to support opel .
the spokesman went on to say that the us would do everything it could to make sure friday 's meeting ended with “ constructive results . ”
guttenberg has said germany wants to put the 1.5 billion euros in government funds along with opel 's assets in a trust fund to shield it from gm until the auto giant files for bankruptcy .
gm announced on thursday that it had reached a debt-for-equity swap deal with major bondholders , the clearest sign yet that a chapter 11 filing is imminent .
eu carefully watching gm-opel split meanwhile , the european union has voiced its concern over germany 's handling of the gm dissolution and called a meeting of the bloc 's trade and economy ministers to discuss the future of opel in europe , insisting that any solution must comply with eu-state aid rules and anti-protectionist policies .
in addition to the plants in germany , gm has opel plants in belgium , poland and spain ; vauxhall plants in britain ; and saab plants in sweden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will eu commissioner verheugen make the opel deal even more complicated ?
officials in belgium , in particular , where 2,600 people work at the opel plant in antwerp , are worried that gm will only keep germany in mind when considering the future of opel .
“ i think it is very important to underline that the solution is a solution for all the eu member states and that it 's not only germany , ” flemish premier kris peeters said on thursday .
the european commission has appealed to national governments to avoid moves that would ensure the survival of opel factories on their soil at the cost of others elsewhere .
eu industry commissioner günther verheugen said that a meeting being held in brussels on friday was a chance for german officials to update their eu counterparts as to what measures are being considered to prop up opel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is in the pole position after fiat dropped out of friday 's meeting meanwhile in berlin , the planned friday meeting between german officials and representatives of magna and gm was suddenly postponed for several hours .

magna has said it will slash some 10,000 jobs across europe , including 2,500 in germany . the german government is expected to provide a 1.5 billion euro bridging loan for the magna takeover bid . talks to secure the future of opel had taken a bad turn in recent days .
negotiations between the german government , general motors , magna and fiat , which had run from wednesday evening into the wee hours of thursday , ended acrimoniously and without result .
friday began with the news that fiat was rescinding its offer .
monday 's probable gm bankruptcy filing was looming large . so , it was with some relief that german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg came to the press before the meeting in the chancellery with a positive development . " magna has made a new presentation , " he said .
" they 're in negotiations with gm , and we are inspecting the offer as well .

" deciding factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal for magna to take over opel seems close the deal first came to light in media reports indicating that magna and gm had come to a tentative agreement late friday .
a deciding factor in closing the deal was said to be whether the parties could get a green light from berlin in order to secure the 1.5-billion-euro bridging loan . the initial details of magna 's offer were not made public , but german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier reportedly brokered the deal in meetings between magna and gm . the sticking point in negotiations on wednesday and thursday was a last-minute request from gm for 300 million euros worth of new help in covering debts .

but recent spats between gas supplier russia and transit country ukraine have left some european countries in the cold .
some nations , including slovakia and its neighbor the czech republic , now think nuclear power may free them from their dependence on russian natural gas .
state-run companies from the czech republic and slovakia announced plans on friday to build a new nuclear reactor in jaslovske bohunice on the site of the old soviet power generator that was shut down last december .
the deal that was signed between czech energy company cez as and slovak state energy firm javys as will set up a joint-stock company to construct a new 100 billion koruny -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- reactor .
javys as will have a 51 percent stake while cez will control 49 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak prime minister robert fico does n't rule out starting up an old reactor no further details were provided , but a feasibility study , due to be completed by 2010 , will provide a timetable for the project .
as recently as this january , slovak officials threatened to re-start the old soviet reactor when gas supplies to several european union countries were halted because of a price dispute between russia and the ukraine .
no guarantees and slovakia still wo n't guarantee not to start the old reactor up again .
" i can not rule it out , " said slovak prime minister robert fico after the european nuclear energy forum in prague . " if there was such a threat in slovakia , it is more important to have light and warmth than dark and cold . "
both the czech and slovak republics are among the biggest proponents of nuclear power .
according to the world nuclear association , slovakia currently has five nuclear generators , which provide half of the country 's electricity , with two more under construction .
the czech republic has six nuclear plants which supply one third of its electricity. av / afp / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in order for the treaty to enter into force , it needs to be ratified by 30 nations .
within europe , germany , britain and the netherlands rank among the biggest stockpilers with a combined total of just under 96 million cluster bombs .
the country with the most bombs by far , 730 million , is the united states , which has not joined the treaty .

"
cluster bombs are either shot from the ground or dropped from airplanes and explode in the air , scattering smaller munitions over an area the size of several football fields .
the munitions do n't explode on contact with the ground but can be detonated later with a mere touch , which makes them especially dangerous to civilians once a conflict has ended .
according to statistics , one third of all cluster bomb casualties are children .

the national teams will be disbanded until each member is deemed fit to return to competition by the federation and the olympic committee .
“ together with the german olympic committee we have decided that our national teams in the events show-jumping , dressage and three-day should be disbanded with immediate effect , " said sönke lauterbach , the federation 's general secretary .
“ those who wish to perform for the national teams in the future will have to appear before and be examined by a special commission .

the leverkusen sports director is still affectionately known by his first name only . dw-tv : is there anyone on the planet who calls you by your full name " rudolf " ?
rudi völler : my mother .
my mother thinks it 's important , but then again ... i mean who today would name their son rudolf ?
but things were different then .
you 've competed in all the big matches : a world cup final , a european championship final , the champions league , but not in a german cup final .
you 're right .
that 's missing from my collection .
i was in the semi-finals twice i think with bremen but we never made it .
so i 'm glad – both for me and the club – that we 're taking part in this true highlight .
in the past ten years , the final in berlin has become something really special .
it 's become just like in england , with the fa cup in wembley .
it 's a huge triumph we earned in the cup competition .
you 're in management at leverkusen but played as a striker for bremen in the 1980s .
are n't you a bit torn ?
no , not at all .
the two things are n't connected .
i had a great five years in bremen during the 80s .
i wish bremen all the best for next season , but not on saturday .
that 's different .
we want to win the match of course .
do leverkusen and bremen both deserve to be there ?
we definitely do .
we never had a real home match because our games were played on a neutral ground .
and in the quarter-finals , we beat the best team in germany – on neutral grounds in düsseldorf .
bayern munich are the best team in germany .
they have the best squad .
and we booted them out – in relatively convincing fashion .
that 's why we deserve to be in the final .
as for bremen , they won that semi-final in hamburg . … on penalties .
okay on penalties , but that does n't matter .
they deserve to be there too .
leverkusen 's league form was disappointing , just like bremen 's .
do you see parallels ?
both teams definitely under-performed in the league .
werder bremen is a club with champions league ambitions .
that was certainly their goal .
ours was a spot in the uefa cup , or fifth place .
neither team achieved what they wanted so there are parallels .
if you win the cup , can you nonetheless say the season was a success ?
yes , but only if we win on saturday .
if we do n't , no matter how the game goes , then for me it wo n't be a successful season .
there 's no getting around it .
leverkusen have n't won a title in 16 years – their last was the german cup in 1993 .
but the team has never beaten bremen in the competition .
bremen 's thomas schaaf is a very experienced coach , while your coach bruno labbadia is in his first season in the top flight .
my only answer is thomas schaaf won the cup in his first season .
that speaks volumes .
what kind of guys are they ?
tough to say .
thomas schaaf is definitely the quieter coach who does n't get upset when things do n't work out .
thomas has done a great job and has made a career for himself in bremen .
bruno has a great career ahead of him .
especially in the first half of the season , he showed what he could do with our team .
we led the league twice and played great , attractive football .
unfortunately , we then fell apart .
consistency has been leverkusen 's problem for years .
they tended to start well and usually looked good on the pitch , but they failed to get the crucial results .
" always the bridesmaid , never the bride " say the team 's critics .
in recent years , leverkusen has come away disappointed from the big games , in the bundesliga , the champions league or the cup final .
i 'm a realist in this respect .
the only thing that counts is where you are now , and i know that in a cup final against bremen , your form on that day is decisive .
whoever has a better day , gets off to the better start and handles the pressure better will win .
it 's fifty-fifty – both teams have an equal chance .
the one thing is n't related to the other .
what are your pre-game expectations .
do you think both teams will come out attacking , or will they try to avoid conceding an early goal .
normally , these are two teams that push the ball up the pitch .
bremen definitely , and we usually do too .
we always feel better pushing forward .
under normal circumstances , you can expect an attractive match .
we 'll have to see how the first few minutes go .
but i ca n't imagine , with the talent that both coaches have at their disposal , that they 'll only try to defend .
i 'm looking forward to it .
and finally , how about a prediction ? 2:1 for bayer leverkusen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i had a great five years in bremen during the 80s .
i wish bremen all the best for next season , but not on saturday .
that 's different .
we want to win the match of course .
do leverkusen and bremen both deserve to be there ?
we definitely do .
we never had a real home match because our games were played on a neutral ground .
and in the quarter-finals , we beat the best team in germany – on neutral grounds in düsseldorf .
bayern munich are the best team in germany .
they have the best squad .
and we booted them out – in relatively convincing fashion .
that 's why we deserve to be in the final .
as for bremen , they won that semi-final in hamburg . … on penalties .
okay on penalties , but that does n't matter .
they deserve to be there too .
leverkusen 's league form was disappointing , just like bremen 's .
do you see parallels ?
both teams definitely under-performed in the league .
werder bremen is a club with champions league ambitions .
that was certainly their goal .
ours was a spot in the uefa cup , or fifth place .
neither team achieved what they wanted so there are parallels .
if you win the cup , can you nonetheless say the season was a success ?
yes , but only if we win on saturday .
if we do n't , no matter how the game goes , then for me it wo n't be a successful season .
there 's no getting around it .
leverkusen have n't won a title in 16 years – their last was the german cup in 1993 .
but the team has never beaten bremen in the competition .
bremen 's thomas schaaf is a very experienced coach , while your coach bruno labbadia is in his first season in the top flight .
my only answer is thomas schaaf won the cup in his first season .
that speaks volumes .
what kind of guys are they ?
tough to say .
thomas schaaf is definitely the quieter coach who does n't get upset when things do n't work out .
thomas has done a great job and has made a career for himself in bremen .
bruno has a great career ahead of him .
especially in the first half of the season , he showed what he could do with our team .
we led the league twice and played great , attractive football .
unfortunately , we then fell apart .
consistency has been leverkusen 's problem for years .
they tended to start well and usually looked good on the pitch , but they failed to get the crucial results .
" always the bridesmaid , never the bride " say the team 's critics .
in recent years , leverkusen has come away disappointed from the big games , in the bundesliga , the champions league or the cup final .
i 'm a realist in this respect .
the only thing that counts is where you are now , and i know that in a cup final against bremen , your form on that day is decisive .
whoever has a better day , gets off to the better start and handles the pressure better will win .
it 's fifty-fifty – both teams have an equal chance .
the one thing is n't related to the other .
what are your pre-game expectations .
do you think both teams will come out attacking , or will they try to avoid conceding an early goal .
normally , these are two teams that push the ball up the pitch .
bremen definitely , and we usually do too .
we always feel better pushing forward .
under normal circumstances , you can expect an attractive match .
we 'll have to see how the first few minutes go .
but i ca n't imagine , with the talent that both coaches have at their disposal , that they 'll only try to defend .
i 'm looking forward to it .

the leverkusen sports director is still affectionately known by his first name only . dw-tv : is there anyone on the planet who calls you by your full name " rudolf " ?
rudi völler : my mother .
my mother thinks it 's important , but then again ... i mean who today would name their son rudolf ?
but things were different then .
you 've competed in all the big matches : a world cup final , a european championship final , the champions league , but not in a german cup final .
you 're right .
that 's missing from my collection .
i was in the semi-finals twice i think with bremen but we never made it .
so i 'm glad – both for me and the club – that we 're taking part in this true highlight .
in the past ten years , the final in berlin has become something really special .
it 's become just like in england , with the fa cup in wembley .
it 's a huge triumph we earned in the cup competition .
you 're in management at leverkusen but played as a striker for bremen in the 1980s .
are n't you a bit torn ?
no , not at all .

the european union says it 's on track to meet kyoto greenhouse gas reduction goals , but the prospects of it meeting its own more ambitious targets are less rosy . the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas is confident that eu countries will meet kyoto protocol goals of reducing emissions of the gases that cause global warming by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
the eu-15 -lrb- the 15 nations that made up the eu when kyoto was agreed upon -rrb- cut emissions by 1.6 percent in 2007 , bringing their total reductions to 5 percent below 1990 levels .
the eu-27 , which includes the 12 countries that joined in 2004 and 2007 , cut emissions by 1.2 percent , bringing their total to 9.3 percent below 1990 levels .
while the 12 newest eu countries are not bound to eu-wide kyoto promises , all member states , with the exception of cyprus and malta , are bound to individual reduction goals .
this latest drop " gives us confidence that we will successfully reach our kyoto target , " dimas said in a statement on friday .
" the proactive climate policies and measures taken nationally and at eu level since kyoto are starting to pay off . "
cuts may not be as significant as they sound the eu 's own report admits that the eu-15 reductions were due mainly to a warmer winter and industry reductions , which suggests that european citizens have not changed their energy-consumption habits .
new figures released by the copenhagen-based european environmental agency -lrb- eea -rrb- indicate that eu policies have had little effect on car and household emissions , which make up a quarter of the bloc 's total greenhouse gas output .
with kyoto set to expire in 2012 , the bigger issue may be whether the eu can meet its own greenhouse gas reduction targets .
in march 2007 the eu agreed to cut emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
united nations talks scheduled to take plan in copenhagen later this year are intended to produce a climate change agreement to replace kyoto. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : carbon capture could help world meet emissions targets as talks on technology 's role in fighting climate change begin in norway , many see carbon capture technology as a way of helping the environment .
it 's permitted in germany , but environmentalists are critical of the plan .
-lrb- 27.05.2009 -rrb- dw-world : little progress made in talks ahead of copenhagen politicians at a pair of international conferences stressed the importance of fighting climate change .
but they could n't agree on the best path forward and germany 's environment minster says disaster looms .
-lrb- 26.05.2009 -rrb- dw-world : germany prepares for mediterranean climate climate change is likely to offer a relatively kind fate to germany , but the country is already preparing for the mixed-bag in store .
rising temperatures could prove problematic to some while others could benefit .

speaking after white house talks with palestinian leader mahmoud abbas , mr obama again urged israel to freeze settlement expansion .
israel has insisted it will allow existing settlements to expand , despite pressure from washington .
president obama also said palestinians must rein in anti-israeli violence . "
this new us president , barack obama , is unlike any that an israeli leader has faced before " jonathan marcus bbc diplomatic correspondent analysis : obama put to the test for his part , mr abbas said he was committed to all obligations under the mid-east peace plan " roadmap " .
however , without a halt to jewish settlements in the occupied west bank , the palestinians have said there can be no progress towards peace .
' israel 's interests ' mr obama said he was a " strong believer in a two-state solution " and believed israel would recognise that it was in the best interests of its long-term security .
west bank settlements construction of settlements began in 1967 , shortly after the six day war some 280,000 israelis now live in the 121 officially-recognised settlements in the west bank a further 190,000 israelis live in settlements in palestinian east jerusalem the largest west bank settlement is maale adumim , where more than 30,000 people were living in 2005 there are 102 unauthorised outposts which are not officially sanctioned by israel source : peace now he said it was important for all countries , but particularly arab states , to be supportive of the two-state solution .
" i am confident that we can move this forward if all parties are ready to meet their obligations , " he said .
mr abbas said the need for progress in the stalled process was urgent .
he added that " time is of the essence " - a phrase also used by mr obama .
he said that he had shared ideas with mr obama based on the 2003 peace plan and the 2002 saudi peace plan supported by the arab league .
under the us-backed 2003 roadmap to peace , israel is obliged to end all settlement activity , specifically including natural growth .
the plan also requires the palestinian authority to crack down on militants who seek to attack israelis .
president obama said he had been " very clear " in his meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu last week on the need to " stop settlements " .
mr netanyahu later said no new settlements would be built but natural growth in existing settlements should be allowed .

ahead of his visit to the middle east next week , mr obama has put mr netanyahu on notice that this white house has a firm agenda of its own , our correspondent adds .
stalled talks the white house meeting between the two leaders is part of an effort by the obama administration to restart stalled peace talks .
mr obama has already met king abdullah of jordan and mr netanyahu .
he plans to meet egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo on 4 june .
earlier on thursday , mrs clinton said washington was pushing for a two-state solution in the middle east as it was in the " best interests " of both the palestinians and israelis .
speaking after a dinner with mr abbas , she said : " we believe strongly in a two-state solution . "
however , israeli government spokesman mark regev said on thursday that israel would continue to allow some construction in west bank settlements despite us calls for a freeze on its work .
he said the fate of the settlements should be decided in peace talks with the palestinians .

the deal marks the xbox 's first move into live linear broadcast tv .
rival consoles , sony 's playstation 3 and nintendo 's wii , can access catch-up tv content via the bbc 's iplayer .
sky 's channels will be available on the xbox 360 from the autumn , but no specific line-up or pricing details have been given .
users of microsoft 's xbox live online service on the 360 in the uk and the irish republic will be able to watch sky 's live sport , programmes , catch-up tv and on demand films , without the need for a satellite dish or set-top box , or being an existing sky customer .
reduced cost ?
sky 's commercial group director stephen nuttall hinted there could be deals for some current sky subscribers . "
it 's a complement and alternative to the existing methods of experiencing sky 's content " stephen nuttall , sky sky customers who have subscribed to premium content packages , or have multiple set-top boxes or one of the bigger broadband packages could get content via their xbox at a reduced cost .
neil thompson , head of xbox for uk and the irish republic , said : " the entertainment world is changing immensely , with consumers looking for choice , flexibility and convenience .
" they also want to experience community elements . "
the line-up of channels and content available via the xbox would be similar to the existing sky player service , available on pcs and macs , said mr nuttall .
virtual personas xbox live users will also be able to watch sky content together virtually , chatting over the broadband connection , and sending messages via their avatars , or virtual personas .

neil thompson , head of xbox for uk and the irish republic , said : " the entertainment world is changing immensely , with consumers looking for choice , flexibility and convenience .
" they also want to experience community elements . "
the line-up of channels and content available via the xbox would be similar to the existing sky player service , available on pcs and macs , said mr nuttall .
virtual personas xbox live users will also be able to watch sky content together virtually , chatting over the broadband connection , and sending messages via their avatars , or virtual personas .
the community viewing aspect will start with sport broadcasts , and could potentially roll out to other live tv content as well .
