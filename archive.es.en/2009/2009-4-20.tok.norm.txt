the 31-year old has been sentenced to eight years in prison for spying , but her trial was anything but fair . in a declaration issued on monday , the european union presidency urged tehran to release us journalist roxana taberi , saying the judicial process that led to her eight-year prison sentence did not meet the standards of a fair and transparent trial .
earlier on monday , us secretary of state hillary clinton also called for the immediate release of saberi describing the spying charges against the journalist as baseless .
last week the 31-year-old journalist , who has iranian and us citizenship , was convicted by an iranian revolutionary court of espionage - notably for the united states - following a one-day trial behind closed doors .
she has been held by iranian authorities since january , when she was initially reported to have been arrested for buying alcohol .
" she has been subjected to a process that has been nontransparent , unpredictable , arbitrary , " clinton said .
" we hope that actions will be taken as soon as possible by the authorities in iran , including the judiciary , to bring about the speedy release of miss saberi and her return home . "
in a surprise move on sunday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad intervened in the case , calling on tehran 's prosecutor general , saeed mortazavi , to personally follow it with precision and fairness .
he also stressed saberi 's right for legal defense assistance .
subsequently ayatollah mahmoud hashemi-shahroudi , the head of iran 's judiciary , ordered the director general of the tehran court to give saberi all legal rights in the appeals court .
saberi has reported for us national public radio , the bbc and fox news , and has been living in iran for the past six years .
she was born in the us and grew up in fargo , north dakota .
her detention comes as the new us administration under president barack obama is seeking to renew ties with tehran . nk / ncy , dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .
the former head of the international monetary fund demanded a " clear-cut timetable " to conclude the current stalled round of talks to encourage free trade around the world . he also called on industry to embrace the challenge of the current economic crisis , by contributing to an " ecological transformation of the global economy . " energy efficiency energy efficiency is the key message of this year 's fair .
the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .
many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy .

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .
the former head of the international monetary fund demanded a " clear-cut timetable " to conclude the current stalled round of talks to encourage free trade around the world . he also called on industry to embrace the challenge of the current economic crisis , by contributing to an " ecological transformation of the global economy . " energy efficiency energy efficiency is the key message of this year 's fair .
the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .
" we also want to put siemens out there as an innovation leader . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .
many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy . " of course we are feeling the effects of the financial crisis , " says roland bent , head of development at phoenix contact . a leading electronic technology manufacturer , phoenix contact is one of the big exhibitors at hanover this year .
" we are reacting by cutting the hours of our employees .
our highest priority is protecting the core of our workforce , " bent said . some 100,000 workers across the industry in germany have had their hours reduced .
but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .
vdma head hannes heese says he expects the current plunge in orders to drop off by next month , as stimulus measures around the world signal a future demand for production . author : henrik boehme / nathan witkop editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .

shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .

" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .
spain had twice rejected calls to extradite honsik , saying holocaust denial and neo-nazi propaganda are not illegal in that country .
he was finally extradited after two europe-wide arrest warrants were issued at austria 's behest . dc / ncy , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .
spain had twice rejected calls to extradite honsik , saying holocaust denial and neo-nazi propaganda are not illegal in that country .
he was finally extradited after two europe-wide arrest warrants were issued at austria 's behest . dc / ncy , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.04.2009 controversy over israel dogs un racism conference - again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un conferences are supposed to combat racial discrimination several western nations joined the us and israel in boycotting this week 's anti-racism un conference in geneva over fears that it would be a repeat of the 2001 durban summit that degenerated into an anti-semitic forum . it 's called the world conference against racism and its mandate is to provide a global un forum for combating gender and racial discrimination and protecting minority rights .
in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .

in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .

at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

the 31-year old has been sentenced to eight years in prison for spying , but her trial was anything but fair . in a declaration issued on monday , the european union presidency urged tehran to release us journalist roxana taberi , saying the judicial process that led to her eight-year prison sentence did not meet the standards of a fair and transparent trial .
earlier on monday , us secretary of state hillary clinton also called for the immediate release of saberi describing the spying charges against the journalist as baseless .
last week the 31-year-old journalist , who has iranian and us citizenship , was convicted by an iranian revolutionary court of espionage - notably for the united states - following a one-day trial behind closed doors .
she has been held by iranian authorities since january , when she was initially reported to have been arrested for buying alcohol .
" she has been subjected to a process that has been nontransparent , unpredictable , arbitrary , " clinton said .
" we hope that actions will be taken as soon as possible by the authorities in iran , including the judiciary , to bring about the speedy release of miss saberi and her return home . "
in a surprise move on sunday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad intervened in the case , calling on tehran 's prosecutor general , saeed mortazavi , to personally follow it with precision and fairness .
he also stressed saberi 's right for legal defense assistance .
subsequently ayatollah mahmoud hashemi-shahroudi , the head of iran 's judiciary , ordered the director general of the tehran court to give saberi all legal rights in the appeals court .
saberi has reported for us national public radio , the bbc and fox news , and has been living in iran for the past six years .
she was born in the us and grew up in fargo , north dakota .

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .

" energy efficiency energy efficiency is the key message of this year 's fair .
the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .
many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy . " of course we are feeling the effects of the financial crisis , " says roland bent , head of development at phoenix contact . a leading electronic technology manufacturer , phoenix contact is one of the big exhibitors at hanover this year .
" we are reacting by cutting the hours of our employees .
our highest priority is protecting the core of our workforce , " bent said . some 100,000 workers across the industry in germany have had their hours reduced .
but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .
spain had twice rejected calls to extradite honsik , saying holocaust denial and neo-nazi propaganda are not illegal in that country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.04.2009 industry looks for a silver lining at hanover 's trade fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orders for german machine tools have dropped by nearly a half in a year judging by interest in the hanover fair , you would n't guess that the world is in the middle of its worst economic crisis in nearly 80 years .
but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .
the former head of the international monetary fund demanded a " clear-cut timetable " to conclude the current stalled round of talks to encourage free trade around the world . he also called on industry to embrace the challenge of the current economic crisis , by contributing to an " ecological transformation of the global economy . " energy efficiency energy efficiency is the key message of this year 's fair .
the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .
" we also want to put siemens out there as an innovation leader . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .
many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy . " of course we are feeling the effects of the financial crisis , " says roland bent , head of development at phoenix contact . a leading electronic technology manufacturer , phoenix contact is one of the big exhibitors at hanover this year .
" we are reacting by cutting the hours of our employees .
our highest priority is protecting the core of our workforce , " bent said . some 100,000 workers across the industry in germany have had their hours reduced .
but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .
vdma head hannes heese says he expects the current plunge in orders to drop off by next month , as stimulus measures around the world signal a future demand for production . author : henrik boehme / nathan witkop editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .
on sunday the pope , who makes his first trip to israel as pontiff next month , called the conference an important initiative and said he hoped it could help " put an end to every form of racism , discrimination and intolerance .

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .
spain had twice rejected calls to extradite honsik , saying holocaust denial and neo-nazi propaganda are not illegal in that country .

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .

honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from russia 's point of view , and from georgia 's point of view , and from the viewpoint of world affairs , such war games carry a clearly provocative character , " russia 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , said .
however , georgian foreign minister grigol vashadze , speaking at a press conference in stockholm on monday underlined his country 's right as a sovereign state to host the exercises .
in brussels , nato said that it had not been informed about russia 's plan to cancel the meeting of top military brass and that it would push on with the exercises in georgia .
" russia has been fully informed as a nato partner of the preparations for this exercise for a year and should recognize that it poses no threat to the stability in the region , " nato spokesman james appathurai said .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned nato already that the exercises could hinder efforts to unfreeze the alliance 's relations with moscow , suspended after the georgia war .
the nato-russia council 's first formal ambassadorial meeting since the resumption of ties is scheduled for april 29 and a ministerial meeting is planned for may 19 .
russian officials have so far sent no signal these two meetings could be at risk .
nato diplomats said this indicated that the process of gradual normalization of relations remained on track and that , if anything , rogozin 's comments could indicate a softening of the russian line as he had only threatened to cancel the may 7 meeting .
the exercises , which have been planned since the spring of 2008 , were originally expected to involve 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries . nk / ncy , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 31-year old has been sentenced to eight years in prison for spying , but her trial was anything but fair . in a declaration issued on monday , the european union presidency urged tehran to release us journalist roxana taberi , saying the judicial process that led to her eight-year prison sentence did not meet the standards of a fair and transparent trial .
earlier on monday , us secretary of state hillary clinton also called for the immediate release of saberi describing the spying charges against the journalist as baseless .
last week the 31-year-old journalist , who has iranian and us citizenship , was convicted by an iranian revolutionary court of espionage - notably for the united states - following a one-day trial behind closed doors .
she has been held by iranian authorities since january , when she was initially reported to have been arrested for buying alcohol .
" she has been subjected to a process that has been nontransparent , unpredictable , arbitrary , " clinton said .
" we hope that actions will be taken as soon as possible by the authorities in iran , including the judiciary , to bring about the speedy release of miss saberi and her return home . "
in a surprise move on sunday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad intervened in the case , calling on tehran 's prosecutor general , saeed mortazavi , to personally follow it with precision and fairness .
he also stressed saberi 's right for legal defense assistance .
subsequently ayatollah mahmoud hashemi-shahroudi , the head of iran 's judiciary , ordered the director general of the tehran court to give saberi all legal rights in the appeals court .
saberi has reported for us national public radio , the bbc and fox news , and has been living in iran for the past six years .

the 31-year old has been sentenced to eight years in prison for spying , but her trial was anything but fair . in a declaration issued on monday , the european union presidency urged tehran to release us journalist roxana taberi , saying the judicial process that led to her eight-year prison sentence did not meet the standards of a fair and transparent trial .
earlier on monday , us secretary of state hillary clinton also called for the immediate release of saberi describing the spying charges against the journalist as baseless .
last week the 31-year-old journalist , who has iranian and us citizenship , was convicted by an iranian revolutionary court of espionage - notably for the united states - following a one-day trial behind closed doors .
she has been held by iranian authorities since january , when she was initially reported to have been arrested for buying alcohol .
" she has been subjected to a process that has been nontransparent , unpredictable , arbitrary , " clinton said .
" we hope that actions will be taken as soon as possible by the authorities in iran , including the judiciary , to bring about the speedy release of miss saberi and her return home . "
in a surprise move on sunday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad intervened in the case , calling on tehran 's prosecutor general , saeed mortazavi , to personally follow it with precision and fairness .
he also stressed saberi 's right for legal defense assistance .
subsequently ayatollah mahmoud hashemi-shahroudi , the head of iran 's judiciary , ordered the director general of the tehran court to give saberi all legal rights in the appeals court .

" from russia 's point of view , and from georgia 's point of view , and from the viewpoint of world affairs , such war games carry a clearly provocative character , " russia 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , said .
however , georgian foreign minister grigol vashadze , speaking at a press conference in stockholm on monday underlined his country 's right as a sovereign state to host the exercises .
in brussels , nato said that it had not been informed about russia 's plan to cancel the meeting of top military brass and that it would push on with the exercises in georgia .
" russia has been fully informed as a nato partner of the preparations for this exercise for a year and should recognize that it poses no threat to the stability in the region , " nato spokesman james appathurai said .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned nato already that the exercises could hinder efforts to unfreeze the alliance 's relations with moscow , suspended after the georgia war .
the nato-russia council 's first formal ambassadorial meeting since the resumption of ties is scheduled for april 29 and a ministerial meeting is planned for may 19 .
russian officials have so far sent no signal these two meetings could be at risk .
nato diplomats said this indicated that the process of gradual normalization of relations remained on track and that , if anything , rogozin 's comments could indicate a softening of the russian line as he had only threatened to cancel the may 7 meeting .
the exercises , which have been planned since the spring of 2008 , were originally expected to involve 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries . nk / ncy , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from russia 's point of view , and from georgia 's point of view , and from the viewpoint of world affairs , such war games carry a clearly provocative character , " russia 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , said .
however , georgian foreign minister grigol vashadze , speaking at a press conference in stockholm on monday underlined his country 's right as a sovereign state to host the exercises .
in brussels , nato said that it had not been informed about russia 's plan to cancel the meeting of top military brass and that it would push on with the exercises in georgia .
" russia has been fully informed as a nato partner of the preparations for this exercise for a year and should recognize that it poses no threat to the stability in the region , " nato spokesman james appathurai said .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned nato already that the exercises could hinder efforts to unfreeze the alliance 's relations with moscow , suspended after the georgia war .
the nato-russia council 's first formal ambassadorial meeting since the resumption of ties is scheduled for april 29 and a ministerial meeting is planned for may 19 .
russian officials have so far sent no signal these two meetings could be at risk .
nato diplomats said this indicated that the process of gradual normalization of relations remained on track and that , if anything , rogozin 's comments could indicate a softening of the russian line as he had only threatened to cancel the may 7 meeting .
the exercises , which have been planned since the spring of 2008 , were originally expected to involve 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries . nk / ncy , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .
on sunday the pope , who makes his first trip to israel as pontiff next month , called the conference an important initiative and said he hoped it could help " put an end to every form of racism , discrimination and intolerance .

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .

the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 20.04.2009 g8 farm ministers unveil global food strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ministers suggest more production , stockpiling to meet demand at the end of a three-day summit on food security , g8 agriculture ministers have called for increased food production to feed the one billion people worldwide suffering from hunger . given a lack of progress in fighting poverty and balancing food supply with demand , the ministers said that more food must be grown to feed the hungry .
in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.04.2009 controversy over israel dogs un racism conference - again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un conferences are supposed to combat racial discrimination several western nations joined the us and israel in boycotting this week 's anti-racism un conference in geneva over fears that it would be a repeat of the 2001 durban summit that degenerated into an anti-semitic forum . it 's called the world conference against racism and its mandate is to provide a global un forum for combating gender and racial discrimination and protecting minority rights .
in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .

but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .

he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "

according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .
" we also want to put siemens out there as an innovation leader . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .
many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy . " of course we are feeling the effects of the financial crisis , " says roland bent , head of development at phoenix contact . a leading electronic technology manufacturer , phoenix contact is one of the big exhibitors at hanover this year .
" we are reacting by cutting the hours of our employees .
our highest priority is protecting the core of our workforce , " bent said . some 100,000 workers across the industry in germany have had their hours reduced .
but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .
spain had twice rejected calls to extradite honsik , saying holocaust denial and neo-nazi propaganda are not illegal in that country .
he was finally extradited after two europe-wide arrest warrants were issued at austria 's behest . dc / ncy , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .
the former head of the international monetary fund demanded a " clear-cut timetable " to conclude the current stalled round of talks to encourage free trade around the world . he also called on industry to embrace the challenge of the current economic crisis , by contributing to an " ecological transformation of the global economy .

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .
on sunday the pope , who makes his first trip to israel as pontiff next month , called the conference an important initiative and said he hoped it could help " put an end to every form of racism , discrimination and intolerance .

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .

in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .
the former head of the international monetary fund demanded a " clear-cut timetable " to conclude the current stalled round of talks to encourage free trade around the world . he also called on industry to embrace the challenge of the current economic crisis , by contributing to an " ecological transformation of the global economy . " energy efficiency energy efficiency is the key message of this year 's fair .
the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .
" we also want to put siemens out there as an innovation leader . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .
many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy . " of course we are feeling the effects of the financial crisis , " says roland bent , head of development at phoenix contact . a leading electronic technology manufacturer , phoenix contact is one of the big exhibitors at hanover this year .
" we are reacting by cutting the hours of our employees .
our highest priority is protecting the core of our workforce , " bent said . some 100,000 workers across the industry in germany have had their hours reduced .
but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .
vdma head hannes heese says he expects the current plunge in orders to drop off by next month , as stimulus measures around the world signal a future demand for production . author : henrik boehme / nathan witkop editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .
spain had twice rejected calls to extradite honsik , saying holocaust denial and neo-nazi propaganda are not illegal in that country .
he was finally extradited after two europe-wide arrest warrants were issued at austria 's behest . dc / ncy , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .
on sunday the pope , who makes his first trip to israel as pontiff next month , called the conference an important initiative and said he hoped it could help " put an end to every form of racism , discrimination and intolerance .

" from russia 's point of view , and from georgia 's point of view , and from the viewpoint of world affairs , such war games carry a clearly provocative character , " russia 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , said .
however , georgian foreign minister grigol vashadze , speaking at a press conference in stockholm on monday underlined his country 's right as a sovereign state to host the exercises .
in brussels , nato said that it had not been informed about russia 's plan to cancel the meeting of top military brass and that it would push on with the exercises in georgia .
" russia has been fully informed as a nato partner of the preparations for this exercise for a year and should recognize that it poses no threat to the stability in the region , " nato spokesman james appathurai said .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned nato already that the exercises could hinder efforts to unfreeze the alliance 's relations with moscow , suspended after the georgia war .
the nato-russia council 's first formal ambassadorial meeting since the resumption of ties is scheduled for april 29 and a ministerial meeting is planned for may 19 .
russian officials have so far sent no signal these two meetings could be at risk .
nato diplomats said this indicated that the process of gradual normalization of relations remained on track and that , if anything , rogozin 's comments could indicate a softening of the russian line as he had only threatened to cancel the may 7 meeting .
the exercises , which have been planned since the spring of 2008 , were originally expected to involve 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries . nk / ncy , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from russia 's point of view , and from georgia 's point of view , and from the viewpoint of world affairs , such war games carry a clearly provocative character , " russia 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , said .
however , georgian foreign minister grigol vashadze , speaking at a press conference in stockholm on monday underlined his country 's right as a sovereign state to host the exercises .
in brussels , nato said that it had not been informed about russia 's plan to cancel the meeting of top military brass and that it would push on with the exercises in georgia .
" russia has been fully informed as a nato partner of the preparations for this exercise for a year and should recognize that it poses no threat to the stability in the region , " nato spokesman james appathurai said .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned nato already that the exercises could hinder efforts to unfreeze the alliance 's relations with moscow , suspended after the georgia war .
the nato-russia council 's first formal ambassadorial meeting since the resumption of ties is scheduled for april 29 and a ministerial meeting is planned for may 19 .
russian officials have so far sent no signal these two meetings could be at risk .
nato diplomats said this indicated that the process of gradual normalization of relations remained on track and that , if anything , rogozin 's comments could indicate a softening of the russian line as he had only threatened to cancel the may 7 meeting .
the exercises , which have been planned since the spring of 2008 , were originally expected to involve 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries . nk / ncy , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

the 1989 song foreshadowed the fall of the iron curtain , taking on special meaning for many in both the east and west . deutsche welle : why have you stayed in hanover ?
many stars choose to move to la or new york , yet you have chosen to stay in a relatively small german city .
klaus meine : the most important thing is to have a place you can come back to , where your roots , family and friends are .
those are things you ca n't transplant .
we 're cosmopolitan and have been traveling around the world for so many years .
wherever we are , the music helps us to feel connected and we never really feel like strangers , whether we 're in siberia or the amazon .
but it 's really important to be able to come back to the place where your roots are , where your family and friends are .
you recently received an echo music award for your life 's work .
does that make you feel old ?
no , not at all .
we 're very honored .
the echo is a very important award and it 's a big honor to receive one . we do n't see it as a final cadence , but rather as an incentive , or motivation to keep playing for our fans in the coming years and to do that which has kept us going for so many years - that is , living our dream of making rock music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scorpions won an echo in february in berlin what are you currently working on ?
we 're working in the studio at the moment and preparing a new project .
after a very turbulent 2008 with 60 shows in 22 countries , we 're now trying to breathe a bit and charge our batteries - but also to be creative .
we 're working on new songs that will hopefully come out towards the end of the year .
that 's really a lot of fun , after doing all those concerts .
" wind of change , " one of your best-known songs , became something of hymn for political change in eastern europe .
was the song conceived as something of an ode to perestroika ?
of course not .
when you write a song , you might have a certain feeling about it , but you can never be sure how a song is going to develop and what will become of it - if it will become a top ten hit , a number one hit , or in this case even an international hit that became like a hymn to the end of the cold war for many people from east and west .
something like that ca n't be imagined or planned .
the only thing i did was try to express in the music all the emotions and everything we experienced in 1988 and 1989 .
we really had the feeling that the world was changing before our eyes - at the latest in august 1989 in moscow .
we had the feeling that the cold war could be over soon , but of course no one thought that the berlin wall would fall just a few months later and that so much in our own country , germany , and in eastern europe would change .
so this song has a particularly special story , which goes way beyond just being a " hit . "
it 's a nice feeling to know that the song touched so many people and , for many , will always be associated with these historical events .
do you feel a special connection to russia ?
we have fans in many different parts of the world , who we have a special connection with .
but we have a particularly special relationship with the russian fans .
i think it goes back to the soviet union , back to 1988 , when we were one of the first bands to play in leningrad .
some of the fans traveled for 20 hours by train from siberia and even further to see the scorpions .
and of course the legendary moscow music peace festival in moscow in 1989 was a special moment in rock history .
we 've also gone back to russia again and again .
less than two years ago , you were invited to play in moscow on the 90th anniversary of the russian secret service .
prime minister vladimir putin , who was president at that time , was at the concert .
what is your opinion of him and his policies ?
i 'd rather leave it to the politicians to make a judgement on putin and his policies .
but i know that putin is very popular in russia , especially among the young people .
whenever we 're on tour in russia , we get the feeling that he 's adored like a pop star , particularly by the younger generation .
that event in the kremlin where we were invited to play was a television show that was broadcast across russia .
we and a few russia artists were n't the only performers ; carlos santana and patricia kaas were also there .
the scorpions will be touring russia again in june 2009 .

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .

many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy .

but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .

many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy . " of course we are feeling the effects of the financial crisis , " says roland bent , head of development at phoenix contact . a leading electronic technology manufacturer , phoenix contact is one of the big exhibitors at hanover this year .
" we are reacting by cutting the hours of our employees .
our highest priority is protecting the core of our workforce , " bent said . some 100,000 workers across the industry in germany have had their hours reduced .
but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .
vdma head hannes heese says he expects the current plunge in orders to drop off by next month , as stimulus measures around the world signal a future demand for production . author : henrik boehme / nathan witkop editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .

barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "

" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .
spain had twice rejected calls to extradite honsik , saying holocaust denial and neo-nazi propaganda are not illegal in that country .
he was finally extradited after two europe-wide arrest warrants were issued at austria 's behest . dc / ncy , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" russia has been fully informed as a nato partner of the preparations for this exercise for a year and should recognize that it poses no threat to the stability in the region , " nato spokesman james appathurai said .

the nato-russia council 's first formal ambassadorial meeting since the resumption of ties is scheduled for april 29 and a ministerial meeting is planned for may 19 .
russian officials have so far sent no signal these two meetings could be at risk .
nato diplomats said this indicated that the process of gradual normalization of relations remained on track and that , if anything , rogozin 's comments could indicate a softening of the russian line as he had only threatened to cancel the may 7 meeting .

" from russia 's point of view , and from georgia 's point of view , and from the viewpoint of world affairs , such war games carry a clearly provocative character , " russia 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , said .
however , georgian foreign minister grigol vashadze , speaking at a press conference in stockholm on monday underlined his country 's right as a sovereign state to host the exercises .
in brussels , nato said that it had not been informed about russia 's plan to cancel the meeting of top military brass and that it would push on with the exercises in georgia .
" russia has been fully informed as a nato partner of the preparations for this exercise for a year and should recognize that it poses no threat to the stability in the region , " nato spokesman james appathurai said .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned nato already that the exercises could hinder efforts to unfreeze the alliance 's relations with moscow , suspended after the georgia war .
the nato-russia council 's first formal ambassadorial meeting since the resumption of ties is scheduled for april 29 and a ministerial meeting is planned for may 19 .
russian officials have so far sent no signal these two meetings could be at risk .
nato diplomats said this indicated that the process of gradual normalization of relations remained on track and that , if anything , rogozin 's comments could indicate a softening of the russian line as he had only threatened to cancel the may 7 meeting .
the exercises , which have been planned since the spring of 2008 , were originally expected to involve 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries . nk / ncy , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

the 31-year old has been sentenced to eight years in prison for spying , but her trial was anything but fair . in a declaration issued on monday , the european union presidency urged tehran to release us journalist roxana taberi , saying the judicial process that led to her eight-year prison sentence did not meet the standards of a fair and transparent trial .
earlier on monday , us secretary of state hillary clinton also called for the immediate release of saberi describing the spying charges against the journalist as baseless .
last week the 31-year-old journalist , who has iranian and us citizenship , was convicted by an iranian revolutionary court of espionage - notably for the united states - following a one-day trial behind closed doors .
she has been held by iranian authorities since january , when she was initially reported to have been arrested for buying alcohol .
" she has been subjected to a process that has been nontransparent , unpredictable , arbitrary , " clinton said .
" we hope that actions will be taken as soon as possible by the authorities in iran , including the judiciary , to bring about the speedy release of miss saberi and her return home . "
in a surprise move on sunday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad intervened in the case , calling on tehran 's prosecutor general , saeed mortazavi , to personally follow it with precision and fairness .
he also stressed saberi 's right for legal defense assistance .
subsequently ayatollah mahmoud hashemi-shahroudi , the head of iran 's judiciary , ordered the director general of the tehran court to give saberi all legal rights in the appeals court .
saberi has reported for us national public radio , the bbc and fox news , and has been living in iran for the past six years .
she was born in the us and grew up in fargo , north dakota .

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .
the former head of the international monetary fund demanded a " clear-cut timetable " to conclude the current stalled round of talks to encourage free trade around the world . he also called on industry to embrace the challenge of the current economic crisis , by contributing to an " ecological transformation of the global economy . " energy efficiency energy efficiency is the key message of this year 's fair .
the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .
" we also want to put siemens out there as an innovation leader . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .
many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy . " of course we are feeling the effects of the financial crisis , " says roland bent , head of development at phoenix contact . a leading electronic technology manufacturer , phoenix contact is one of the big exhibitors at hanover this year .
" we are reacting by cutting the hours of our employees .
our highest priority is protecting the core of our workforce , " bent said . some 100,000 workers across the industry in germany have had their hours reduced .
but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .

alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .

the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .
on sunday the pope , who makes his first trip to israel as pontiff next month , called the conference an important initiative and said he hoped it could help " put an end to every form of racism , discrimination and intolerance .

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .
on sunday the pope , who makes his first trip to israel as pontiff next month , called the conference an important initiative and said he hoped it could help " put an end to every form of racism , discrimination and intolerance .

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the other concerns oneworld members american airlines , british airways and iberia , according to a statement released in brussels .
in both cases , the airlines jointly manage schedules , capacity and pricing on routes between the european union and north america .

the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .

the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .

the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .

criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .

honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .
spain had twice rejected calls to extradite honsik , saying holocaust denial and neo-nazi propaganda are not illegal in that country .
he was finally extradited after two europe-wide arrest warrants were issued at austria 's behest . dc / ncy , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from russia 's point of view , and from georgia 's point of view , and from the viewpoint of world affairs , such war games carry a clearly provocative character , " russia 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , said .
however , georgian foreign minister grigol vashadze , speaking at a press conference in stockholm on monday underlined his country 's right as a sovereign state to host the exercises .
in brussels , nato said that it had not been informed about russia 's plan to cancel the meeting of top military brass and that it would push on with the exercises in georgia .
" russia has been fully informed as a nato partner of the preparations for this exercise for a year and should recognize that it poses no threat to the stability in the region , " nato spokesman james appathurai said .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned nato already that the exercises could hinder efforts to unfreeze the alliance 's relations with moscow , suspended after the georgia war .
the nato-russia council 's first formal ambassadorial meeting since the resumption of ties is scheduled for april 29 and a ministerial meeting is planned for may 19 .
russian officials have so far sent no signal these two meetings could be at risk .
nato diplomats said this indicated that the process of gradual normalization of relations remained on track and that , if anything , rogozin 's comments could indicate a softening of the russian line as he had only threatened to cancel the may 7 meeting .
the exercises , which have been planned since the spring of 2008 , were originally expected to involve 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries . nk / ncy , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from russia 's point of view , and from georgia 's point of view , and from the viewpoint of world affairs , such war games carry a clearly provocative character , " russia 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , said .

it could also sell off some of its business units . ceo karl-gerhard eick said he would ask for a major loan to restructure its business .
the company will focus on making its core business profitable again , eick said monday in a telephone conference . the restructuring costs are in addition to 776 million euros in loans , which the company will need to renegotiate with banks by mid-june .
besides karstadt stores , the essen-based company also owns mail-order firms quelle and primondo and travel firm thomas cook .

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .

the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .

many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy .

in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

the 31-year old has been sentenced to eight years in prison for spying , but her trial was anything but fair . in a declaration issued on monday , the european union presidency urged tehran to release us journalist roxana taberi , saying the judicial process that led to her eight-year prison sentence did not meet the standards of a fair and transparent trial .
earlier on monday , us secretary of state hillary clinton also called for the immediate release of saberi describing the spying charges against the journalist as baseless .
last week the 31-year-old journalist , who has iranian and us citizenship , was convicted by an iranian revolutionary court of espionage - notably for the united states - following a one-day trial behind closed doors .
she has been held by iranian authorities since january , when she was initially reported to have been arrested for buying alcohol .
" she has been subjected to a process that has been nontransparent , unpredictable , arbitrary , " clinton said .
" we hope that actions will be taken as soon as possible by the authorities in iran , including the judiciary , to bring about the speedy release of miss saberi and her return home . "
in a surprise move on sunday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad intervened in the case , calling on tehran 's prosecutor general , saeed mortazavi , to personally follow it with precision and fairness .
he also stressed saberi 's right for legal defense assistance .
subsequently ayatollah mahmoud hashemi-shahroudi , the head of iran 's judiciary , ordered the director general of the tehran court to give saberi all legal rights in the appeals court .
saberi has reported for us national public radio , the bbc and fox news , and has been living in iran for the past six years .
she was born in the us and grew up in fargo , north dakota .
her detention comes as the new us administration under president barack obama is seeking to renew ties with tehran . nk / ncy , dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .
the former head of the international monetary fund demanded a " clear-cut timetable " to conclude the current stalled round of talks to encourage free trade around the world . he also called on industry to embrace the challenge of the current economic crisis , by contributing to an " ecological transformation of the global economy . " energy efficiency energy efficiency is the key message of this year 's fair .
the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .
" we also want to put siemens out there as an innovation leader . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .
many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy . " of course we are feeling the effects of the financial crisis , " says roland bent , head of development at phoenix contact . a leading electronic technology manufacturer , phoenix contact is one of the big exhibitors at hanover this year .
" we are reacting by cutting the hours of our employees .
our highest priority is protecting the core of our workforce , " bent said . some 100,000 workers across the industry in germany have had their hours reduced .
but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .
vdma head hannes heese says he expects the current plunge in orders to drop off by next month , as stimulus measures around the world signal a future demand for production . author : henrik boehme / nathan witkop editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "

meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .
the former head of the international monetary fund demanded a " clear-cut timetable " to conclude the current stalled round of talks to encourage free trade around the world . he also called on industry to embrace the challenge of the current economic crisis , by contributing to an " ecological transformation of the global economy . " energy efficiency energy efficiency is the key message of this year 's fair .
the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .
" we also want to put siemens out there as an innovation leader . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .
many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy . " of course we are feeling the effects of the financial crisis , " says roland bent , head of development at phoenix contact . a leading electronic technology manufacturer , phoenix contact is one of the big exhibitors at hanover this year .
" we are reacting by cutting the hours of our employees .
our highest priority is protecting the core of our workforce , " bent said . some 100,000 workers across the industry in germany have had their hours reduced .
but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .
on sunday the pope , who makes his first trip to israel as pontiff next month , called the conference an important initiative and said he hoped it could help " put an end to every form of racism , discrimination and intolerance .

but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .
the former head of the international monetary fund demanded a " clear-cut timetable " to conclude the current stalled round of talks to encourage free trade around the world . he also called on industry to embrace the challenge of the current economic crisis , by contributing to an " ecological transformation of the global economy . " energy efficiency energy efficiency is the key message of this year 's fair .
the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .
" we also want to put siemens out there as an innovation leader . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.04.2009 controversy over israel dogs un racism conference - again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un conferences are supposed to combat racial discrimination several western nations joined the us and israel in boycotting this week 's anti-racism un conference in geneva over fears that it would be a repeat of the 2001 durban summit that degenerated into an anti-semitic forum . it 's called the world conference against racism and its mandate is to provide a global un forum for combating gender and racial discrimination and protecting minority rights .
in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

the 31-year old has been sentenced to eight years in prison for spying , but her trial was anything but fair . in a declaration issued on monday , the european union presidency urged tehran to release us journalist roxana taberi , saying the judicial process that led to her eight-year prison sentence did not meet the standards of a fair and transparent trial .
earlier on monday , us secretary of state hillary clinton also called for the immediate release of saberi describing the spying charges against the journalist as baseless .
last week the 31-year-old journalist , who has iranian and us citizenship , was convicted by an iranian revolutionary court of espionage - notably for the united states - following a one-day trial behind closed doors .
she has been held by iranian authorities since january , when she was initially reported to have been arrested for buying alcohol .
" she has been subjected to a process that has been nontransparent , unpredictable , arbitrary , " clinton said .
" we hope that actions will be taken as soon as possible by the authorities in iran , including the judiciary , to bring about the speedy release of miss saberi and her return home . "
in a surprise move on sunday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad intervened in the case , calling on tehran 's prosecutor general , saeed mortazavi , to personally follow it with precision and fairness .
he also stressed saberi 's right for legal defense assistance .
subsequently ayatollah mahmoud hashemi-shahroudi , the head of iran 's judiciary , ordered the director general of the tehran court to give saberi all legal rights in the appeals court .
saberi has reported for us national public radio , the bbc and fox news , and has been living in iran for the past six years .

the 31-year old has been sentenced to eight years in prison for spying , but her trial was anything but fair . in a declaration issued on monday , the european union presidency urged tehran to release us journalist roxana taberi , saying the judicial process that led to her eight-year prison sentence did not meet the standards of a fair and transparent trial .
earlier on monday , us secretary of state hillary clinton also called for the immediate release of saberi describing the spying charges against the journalist as baseless .
last week the 31-year-old journalist , who has iranian and us citizenship , was convicted by an iranian revolutionary court of espionage - notably for the united states - following a one-day trial behind closed doors .
she has been held by iranian authorities since january , when she was initially reported to have been arrested for buying alcohol .
" she has been subjected to a process that has been nontransparent , unpredictable , arbitrary , " clinton said .
" we hope that actions will be taken as soon as possible by the authorities in iran , including the judiciary , to bring about the speedy release of miss saberi and her return home . "
in a surprise move on sunday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad intervened in the case , calling on tehran 's prosecutor general , saeed mortazavi , to personally follow it with precision and fairness .
he also stressed saberi 's right for legal defense assistance .
subsequently ayatollah mahmoud hashemi-shahroudi , the head of iran 's judiciary , ordered the director general of the tehran court to give saberi all legal rights in the appeals court .
saberi has reported for us national public radio , the bbc and fox news , and has been living in iran for the past six years .
she was born in the us and grew up in fargo , north dakota .

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .

" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .
spain had twice rejected calls to extradite honsik , saying holocaust denial and neo-nazi propaganda are not illegal in that country .

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 31-year old has been sentenced to eight years in prison for spying , but her trial was anything but fair . in a declaration issued on monday , the european union presidency urged tehran to release us journalist roxana taberi , saying the judicial process that led to her eight-year prison sentence did not meet the standards of a fair and transparent trial .
earlier on monday , us secretary of state hillary clinton also called for the immediate release of saberi describing the spying charges against the journalist as baseless .
last week the 31-year-old journalist , who has iranian and us citizenship , was convicted by an iranian revolutionary court of espionage - notably for the united states - following a one-day trial behind closed doors .
she has been held by iranian authorities since january , when she was initially reported to have been arrested for buying alcohol .
" she has been subjected to a process that has been nontransparent , unpredictable , arbitrary , " clinton said .
" we hope that actions will be taken as soon as possible by the authorities in iran , including the judiciary , to bring about the speedy release of miss saberi and her return home . "
in a surprise move on sunday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad intervened in the case , calling on tehran 's prosecutor general , saeed mortazavi , to personally follow it with precision and fairness .
he also stressed saberi 's right for legal defense assistance .
subsequently ayatollah mahmoud hashemi-shahroudi , the head of iran 's judiciary , ordered the director general of the tehran court to give saberi all legal rights in the appeals court .
saberi has reported for us national public radio , the bbc and fox news , and has been living in iran for the past six years .
she was born in the us and grew up in fargo , north dakota .
her detention comes as the new us administration under president barack obama is seeking to renew ties with tehran . nk / ncy , dpa / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "

meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "

meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .

shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .

" some nations , who by rights should be helping to forge a path to a better future , are not here , " the secretary general said as he opened the meeting in geneva , telling delegates he was " profoundly disappointed . "
" i deeply regret that some have chosen to stand aside .
i hope they will not do so for long , " ban added , before holding his own meeting with ahmadinejad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the seats of israel and several other countries invited to the meeting remain empty poland became the latest nation to boycott the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said berlin 's decision was made based on concerns that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests . "
the vice president of germany 's central council of jews , dieter graumann , welcomed steinmeier 's decision in an interview published by the online portal of germany 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" the whole event is a propaganda show for fanatical haters of israel , " graumann said , adding that european union member states ' failure to present a united front in boycotting the conference was a " disgrace . "
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but would not send any high level officials , while the french delegation urged other european representatives to walk out of the conference if ahmadinejad made " anti-semitic accusations . "
ahmadinejad has caused outrage in israel and other western nations by repeatedly saying the holocaust was a " myth " and saying the jewish state should be " wiped off the map . "
before his arrival in geneva , he launched a new broadside against israel , saying " the zionist ideology and regime are the flag-bearers of racism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's presence at the conference is controversial the european jewish congress said ahmadinejad 's presence meant the un had " put the fox in charge of the hen house . "
meanwhile , the diplomatic fallout has spread as israel recalled its ambassador in protest at swiss president hans-rudolf merz 's decision to meet ahmadinejad .
the sunday meeting was the iranian leader 's first formal discussion with a western head of state since he took office in 2005 .
disputed text the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference in geneva is likely to take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year blamed israel for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
negotiators in geneva said on friday that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration removed all references to israel and the middle east .
but diplomats say middle eastern nations insisted that a clause about the incitement of religious hatred remain in the text , which many western countries see as a curtailment of free speech .
us president barack obama said anti-israeli language in the draft final communique that was " oftentimes completely hypocritical and counterproductive " had been the red line for his administration .
un secretary general ban ki-moon , however , defended the disputed conference text as " carefully balanced , " saying the conference was necessary to confront simmering racial tensions that could otherwise trigger social unrest and violence .
papal position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statement from pope benedict xvi said the un racism conference is important meanwhile , pope benedict xvi 's decision to send a vatican delegation to the conference has opened a new rift in relations with jewish groups .
" by participating , the vatican has given its endorsement to what is being prepared there -lsb- against israel -rsb- , " rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , told the italian newspaper la stampa .
shimon samuels , head of the european office of the simon wiesenthal center , said the vatican " is giving a seal of approval in the hate campaign " against israel .
" this is not a position on which one can hedge , " samuels told reuters news agency .
" you ca n't have it both ways .
the vatican is a powerful voice and -lsb- a boycott -rsb- could have had a strong demonstrative effect . "
chief vatican spokesman father federico lombardi defended the vatican 's presence and said a disputed conference text has been improved in recent weeks .
" this is an international conference promoted by the united nations and the holy see .
just because some important countries are not attending does not mean that the holy see can not have a positive and constructive dialogue there , " he said .
on sunday the pope , who makes his first trip to israel as pontiff next month , called the conference an important initiative and said he hoped it could help " put an end to every form of racism , discrimination and intolerance .

in their 13-point final declaration , participants said they were placing " agriculture and food security at the core of the international agenda . "
the document will serve as a set of " messages " to the main g8 summit scheduled for july .
the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .
price speculation is one of the factors that has helped drive up the cost of basic foods , sparking riots in poor countries .
the ministers pledged to monitor the causes of price volatility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices of basic foods have spiralled out of reach for many of the world 's poor " there should be monitoring and further analysis of factors potentially affecting price volatility in commodity markets , including speculation , " their statement said .
no new financial measures however , the statement also contained the stark admission that the world is " very far " from achieving a united nations commitment to halve the number of hungry people by 2015 .
the g8 based its assessment on estimates provided by un agencies that the number of hungry people is set to top 1 billion this year .
there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .
instead , the document stressed the importance of " increasing public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection in cooperation with international organizations . "
the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "
in two expanded sessions of the meeting , the g8 representatives were also joined by representatives of the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico and south africa - as well as delegates from australia , argentina and egypt and international and un food agencies .
oxfam critical of outcome poorer nations have long accused richer nations of using " standards " to protect their own products , including foodstuffs .
in the final declaration , the g8 said they would continue to " support capacity building in developing countries in sanitary and phytosanitary standards in order to facilitate access to markets and fulfill requirements of consumers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels producers must be more mindful of food security , ministers say the g8 agriculture ministers in the final declaration also said that while the production of renewable energy sources such as biofuels should be encouraged , this must be done in ways that do n't compromise food security .
criticizing the document , international relief group oxfam noted that " even without additional money , " efforts to combat hunger are possible .
in a statement , it called on rich countries to redirect " a relatively small proportion of the direct subsidies they give to their farmers in order to boost food production in developing countries . "
in 2008 , rich countries gave $ 125 billion -lrb- 97 billion euros -rrb- directly to their farmers in comparison to the $ 5.9 billion they gave to agriculture in poor countries , oxfam said . dc / ncy , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if found guilty , he could face up to 20 years in prison . gerd honsik , 68 , had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1992 for propagating holocaust denial in his book " acquittal for hitler ? "
however , he fled to spain during his appeal and spent 15 years there before being extradited to austria in 2007 .
he now faces new charges for articles he allegedly wrote and circulated on the internet .
the opening of his trial coincided with nazi leader adolf hitler 's 120th birthday - a fact that was not lost on the prosecution .
" one hundred and twenty years after hitler 's birth , there are still people denying his atrocities , " prosecutor stefan apostol was quoted by national news agency apa as saying in his opening statement .
" that 's not just sad , it 's dangerous . "
honsik pleaded innocent to the charges , saying he had no idea he was committing an offence when he disputed the existence of the nazi gas chambers in his magazine , " halt , " in 1994 .
his lawyer , herbert schaller , also said that the existence of the gas chambers was " just the prevailing view " and called for relevant evidence to be presented .
spain had twice rejected calls to extradite honsik , saying holocaust denial and neo-nazi propaganda are not illegal in that country .
he was finally extradited after two europe-wide arrest warrants were issued at austria 's behest . dc / ncy , reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "
ban had met ahmadinejad for talks on the sidelines of the conference before the iranian leader delivered his speech .
bildunterschrift : the un chief said their conversation stressed the " need to look to the future of unity , not to the past of divisiveness . "
" the secretary general reminded the president that the un general assembly had adopted the resolution to revoke the equation of zionism with racism , " a un statement read .
they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .
poland was the latest nation to pull out of the meeting after germany , the united states , israel , canada , australia , italy , the netherlands and new zealand .
weekend discussions saw eu envoys fail to come up with a joint position on the conference among the 27 member states .
britain , for example , said it would attend the event but not send any high level officials , while france sent a delegation with a warning that its representatives would leave if ahmadinejad used the conference to criticize israel . sje / ncy , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from russia 's point of view , and from georgia 's point of view , and from the viewpoint of world affairs , such war games carry a clearly provocative character , " russia 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , said .
however , georgian foreign minister grigol vashadze , speaking at a press conference in stockholm on monday underlined his country 's right as a sovereign state to host the exercises .
in brussels , nato said that it had not been informed about russia 's plan to cancel the meeting of top military brass and that it would push on with the exercises in georgia .
" russia has been fully informed as a nato partner of the preparations for this exercise for a year and should recognize that it poses no threat to the stability in the region , " nato spokesman james appathurai said .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned nato already that the exercises could hinder efforts to unfreeze the alliance 's relations with moscow , suspended after the georgia war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.04.2009 controversy over israel dogs un racism conference - again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un conferences are supposed to combat racial discrimination several western nations joined the us and israel in boycotting this week 's anti-racism un conference in geneva over fears that it would be a repeat of the 2001 durban summit that degenerated into an anti-semitic forum . it 's called the world conference against racism and its mandate is to provide a global un forum for combating gender and racial discrimination and protecting minority rights .
in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

in 1978 , when the first un conference was held in geneva , the focus was south africa 's apartheid policy .
in that case , international pressure played a key role in the demise of a system more than a decade later that segregated the country 's inhabitants according to the color of their skin .
since then , the un 's anti-racism conference has been held two more times - in geneva in1983 and most recently in durban , south africa , in 2001 .
in durban , the agenda was supposed to address grievances from oppressed minority groups , such as the roma in europe and the " untouchables " of india , but it was derailed when the israeli-palestinian conflict took center stage and led to political recriminations . anti-racist conference turned anti-semitic both the us and israeli delegations had stormed out midway through the conference over a draft resolution that equated zionism with racism and singled out the jewish state for committing genocide , apartheid and other war crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president calls israel " the most cruel and racist regime " the durban meeting , however , was best remembered for provocations from non-governmental organizations .
pro-palestinian advocates passed out leaflets depicting adolf hitler with the caption : " what if i had won ?
there would be no israel and no palestinian bloodshed . "
at the week-long un durban review conference that kicked off on monday in geneva , the fallout from the 2001 clashes has again surfaced .
iranian leader ignites old passions the list of nations boycotting the conference kept growing longer .
poland joined the list of western absentees on monday , following on the heels of germany , italy , the netherlands and sweden as well as the united states , canada , australia and israel .
the british , french and other european union delegates in attendance had walked out in a mass protest after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who has denied the holocaust and threatened to " wipe israel off the map , " added more fuel to the fire in his keynote address .
in a monday afternoon speech , ahmadinejad said that the palestinian people were " made homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering " when israel was created in 1948 in the aftermath of world war ii , calling the zionist state " the most cruel and racist regime . "
abmadinejad 's remarks have only served to vindicate the countries that boycotted the un conference in the first place .
even back in 1978 and 1983 , israel had been pilloried by its muslim and arab neighbors .
observers who attended the durban meeting in 2001 told deutsche welle that they still have n't gotten over the impassioned anti-semitic tone of the conference .
" i was so totally shocked .
the whole atmosphere at the conference , which was about combating racism , wound up being one which promoted racism , " said one ngo delegate .
political conflicts have no place at anti-racism conference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hecklers condemned ahmadinejad 's anti-semitic remarks rabbi michael melchior , who was then israel 's deputy foreign minister , said that durban had turned into " a farce " that made any possibility of future dialogue impossible .
" to criticize policies of the government of israel is legitimate , even vital .
but there is a profound difference between criticizing a country and denying its right to exist .
anti-zionism , the denial of jews the basic right to a home , is nothing but anti-semitism , pure and simple , " said melchior .
" the conflict between us and our palestinian neighbors is not racial and has no place at this conference .
it is political and territorial .
the outrageous and manic accusations we have heard here are attempts to turn a political issue into a racial one , with almost no hope of resolution , " he continued .
durban 2001 overshadowed by 9/11 the durban conference was overshadowed only days later by the events of september 11 , 2001 .
so the question of how a un conference to combat racism could turn into a forum of anti-semitic attacks was left unanswered .
mary robinson , the former irish president who had been the un high commissioner for human rights back then said , " durban must be a beginning -lsb- for dialogue -rsb- and should not be the end of it .
we must have a follow-up conference . "
but now the iranian president 's inflammatory rhetoric has threatened to further undermine any resolution in the absence of virtually all western powers for the rest of the week .

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .
the group was formed in 2000 , when they won in a talent competition on german rtl television .

the 31-year old has been sentenced to eight years in prison for spying , but her trial was anything but fair . in a declaration issued on monday , the european union presidency urged tehran to release us journalist roxana taberi , saying the judicial process that led to her eight-year prison sentence did not meet the standards of a fair and transparent trial .
earlier on monday , us secretary of state hillary clinton also called for the immediate release of saberi describing the spying charges against the journalist as baseless .
last week the 31-year-old journalist , who has iranian and us citizenship , was convicted by an iranian revolutionary court of espionage - notably for the united states - following a one-day trial behind closed doors .

besides karstadt stores , the essen-based company also owns mail-order firms quelle and primondo and travel firm thomas cook .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.04.2009 industry looks for a silver lining at hanover 's trade fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orders for german machine tools have dropped by nearly a half in a year judging by interest in the hanover fair , you would n't guess that the world is in the middle of its worst economic crisis in nearly 80 years .
but other figures paint a grim picture . this year 's hanover fair has attracted only marginally fewer exhibitors than in recent years , featuring some 6,150 displays from 61 countries .
the exposition , in the capital of the northern german state of lower saxony , has long been one of the world 's most important showcases for the machine tool trade - a cornerstone of germany 's exports .
the global economic crisis is an issue that is impossible to escape at this year 's fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's president koehler wants a green industrial revolution german president horst koehler opened the event on sunday , criticizing a perceived lurch towards protectionism in some countries .
the former head of the international monetary fund demanded a " clear-cut timetable " to conclude the current stalled round of talks to encourage free trade around the world . he also called on industry to embrace the challenge of the current economic crisis , by contributing to an " ecological transformation of the global economy . " energy efficiency energy efficiency is the key message of this year 's fair .
the german engineering federation -lrb- vdma -rrb- says environmental technologies will play a major role in turning manufacturing-based economies around .
according to the vdma , last year such technologies accounted for 32 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- worth of goods in the german economy and this year many businesses are hoping to extend that trend , despite a recession . for example , the makers of " ratnic , " a small robot designed to perform inspection tasks on vertical and inclined cables , pipes and wires . according to its designers , from the friedrich schiller university of jena , ratnic uses 70 percent less energy than conventional climbing robots by mimicking the techniques of a rat . motors are one of the greatest sources of potential efficiency gains - an estimated two-thirds of industrial electricity-use is tied up with motors of some sort , from pumps , to ventilators to ship 's engines . one device on display generates electricity through the vibration of its surroundings , a useful way of powering microprocessors . targeting manufacturers that rely on outdated engines , industrial giant siemens told deutsche welle that upgrading capital should not necessarily be put off for a sunny day . " we want to show that innovation and things like saving energy offer the best opportunities to spur growth , " said juergen brandes , who is the head of drive technology at siemens .
" we also want to put siemens out there as an innovation leader . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry hopes to win new buyers through efficiency and automation plunge in orders despite the upbeat attitude , visitors to hanover 's trade fair are facing some pretty grim facts . orders for german machine tools have plunged by nearly half since last year .
many of their customers , manufacturers in europe and further abroad , are watching their sales dry up and are in no mood for investment . last thursday , the european statistics office , eurostat , revealed that factories in the countries that use the euro currency slashed production by 18.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to february . much of the eurozone 's unprecedented slump was tied to falling sales for durable goods such as cars , despite a german government incentive scheme for the auto industry , which has seen automotive sales jump in europe 's largest economy . " of course we are feeling the effects of the financial crisis , " says roland bent , head of development at phoenix contact . a leading electronic technology manufacturer , phoenix contact is one of the big exhibitors at hanover this year .
" we are reacting by cutting the hours of our employees .
our highest priority is protecting the core of our workforce , " bent said . some 100,000 workers across the industry in germany have had their hours reduced .
but the industry also thinks it can see the beginnings of a recovery taking shape .
vdma head hannes heese says he expects the current plunge in orders to drop off by next month , as stimulus measures around the world signal a future demand for production . author : henrik boehme / nathan witkop editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers from the us , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , canada and russia also called for a study on setting up a global system to stockpile essential foodstuffs .
" we call upon the relevant international institutions to examine whether a system of stockholding could be effective in dealing with humanitarian emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility , " the ministers said in the final declaration from their meeting , held at a hillside castle in northern italy .

there was no mention of new financial measures to redirect more funds to agriculture , nor did the document identify specific sums of money to be used to replenish and increase food supplies .

the g8 also called for enhancing investments in agricultural science as well as " increasingly share technology , processes and ideas with other countries . "

" following world war ii they resorted to military aggressions to make an entire nation homeless under the pretext of jewish suffering , " ahmadinejad told the audience , speaking through a translator .
" and they sent migrants from europe , the united states and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied palestine , " he said .
" and in fact , in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine . "
representatives of 23 european union delegations quit the conference room in protest at some of ahmadinejad 's comments , while two protesters dressed as clowns were ejected for heckling the iranian leader and calling him a " racist . "
mass walk-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the audience heckled ahmadinejad and called him a racist british ambassador peter gooderham condemned the iranian leader 's " offensive and inflammatory comments " that prompted the european delegates to stream out of the assembly hall .
" such outrageous anti-semitic remarks should have no place in a un anti-racism forum , " he said .
slovenian ambassador andrej logar called the iranian comments - which prompted applause among delegates who remained in the un assembly hall - " detrimental to the dignity of this conference . "
most delegates who left the hall said they would return after ahmadinejad finished speaking .
norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr store , however , stayed in the audience because he was the next speaker scheduled after ahmadinejad .
store told delegates that he rejected the iranian leader 's comments because they violated the spirit of the conference " norway will not accept that ' the odd man out ' hijacks the collective effort of the many , " store said .
french president nicolas sarkozy later condemned ahmadinejad 's " speech of hate " and urged a firm and united european union reaction .
un reactions un secretary general ban ki-moon condemned the iranian president 's speech as completely inappropriate .
" i deplore the use of this platform by the iranian president to accuse , divide and even incite , " ban said in a statement .
" this is the opposite of what this conference seeks to achieve . "
he said the speech would make it more difficult to deal with the " very real problem of racism . "

they also discussed the conference , regional peace and security , afghanistan , iraq and the middle east as well as the iranian nuclear issue , un officials said .
earlier on monday ban decried a number of western nations ' decisions to boycott the conference for fear it would become a forum for anti-semitism .

" from russia 's point of view , and from georgia 's point of view , and from the viewpoint of world affairs , such war games carry a clearly provocative character , " russia 's envoy to nato , dmitry rogozin , said .
however , georgian foreign minister grigol vashadze , speaking at a press conference in stockholm on monday underlined his country 's right as a sovereign state to host the exercises .
in brussels , nato said that it had not been informed about russia 's plan to cancel the meeting of top military brass and that it would push on with the exercises in georgia .
" russia has been fully informed as a nato partner of the preparations for this exercise for a year and should recognize that it poses no threat to the stability in the region , " nato spokesman james appathurai said .
russian president dmitry medvedev has warned nato already that the exercises could hinder efforts to unfreeze the alliance 's relations with moscow , suspended after the georgia war .
the nato-russia council 's first formal ambassadorial meeting since the resumption of ties is scheduled for april 29 and a ministerial meeting is planned for may 19 .
russian officials have so far sent no signal these two meetings could be at risk .
nato diplomats said this indicated that the process of gradual normalization of relations remained on track and that , if anything , rogozin 's comments could indicate a softening of the russian line as he had only threatened to cancel the may 7 meeting .
the exercises , which have been planned since the spring of 2008 , were originally expected to involve 1,300 personnel from 19 nato and partner countries . nk / ncy , afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since her arrest shortly before she was due to perform at a club in frankfurt a week and a half ago , benaissa has been in police custody .
she 's accused of having had unprotected sex with three men despite knowing she was hiv positive , according to state prosecutors in darmstadt .
one of the men she slept with is now hiv positive , possibly as a consequence of his sexual relations with her .
some legal experts have questioned the way the 26-year-old has been treated by the justice system so far .
ulrich preuss , professor at the hertie school of governance , said he had the impression that " many things have gone wrong . "
arrest is disproportionate , dah says over the weekend , an array of experts made appearances in the german media to say that the state prosecutor 's office had gone too far in sharing details about the singer 's case with the public , and in so doing had failed to protect her right to privacy and the presumption of innocence .
deutsche aids hilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- , the german umbrella group representing regional hiv / aids organizations has also been critical of the prosecution .
" nadja benaissa should be released as soon as possible , " dah said .
it called her arrest " disproportionate . "
but attempts to muzzle the tabloid bild zeitung 's reporting of the case have angered other camps .
on thursday , the paper 's editor-in-chief , kai diekmann , ignored an injunction from the regional court in berlin , and went ahead with an article which asked whether benaissa was facing a 10-year prison sentence for her conduct .
diekmann defended his decision in an editorial , calling the court 's ruling " scandalous . "
" if serious crimes are now part of the private sphere , then the press wo n't be able to report on anything anymore , " he wrote .
the liberal free democratic party 's media expert hans-joachim otto also criticized the injunction against bild .
" nobody wrote that ms. benaissa is guilty , " he said .
" the fact that she is being detained for questioning is a fact that is in the public interest . "
what constitutes public interest ?
otto referred to a european court ruling that said that it 's justified for media reports to ignite a serious debate on an issue .
the benaissa case , he said , was a good vehicle for starting a " very valuable " debate about the infection risks posed by people who are hiv positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in happier days : nadja -lrb- far right -rrb- with her bandmates but aids activist and former german tennis star michael stich disagreed , saying he does n't approve of the publicity benaissa 's case is creating for the cause of aids prevention .
" it makes me sad that the media are only now reporting on such an important , serious topic , only because now it 's affecting a celebrity , " stich said .
he added that it is the general culture of silence about hiv / aids in germany that has even made such a case possible .
however , he said that if the allegations about the singer 's conduct are correct , he would deem that " morally wrong . "
" i ca n't put it any other way , " he told the berliner morgenpost .
" if someone knows that they are infected with hiv and accept the risk of infecting someone else , then that 's just morally wrong . "
however , he said he does n't want to see benaissa treated unfairly .
" no matter how you look at it , nadja is a victim , " stich said .
" whether she 's also a perpetrator remains to be seen . "
benaissa 's band , " no angels , " is germany 's most successful girl band , with 5 million album sales in their first three years .

officials said that by sunday afternoon , the ministers had reached consensus on about two-thirds of the 13 points they wish to convey to their heads of government at the g8 summit in sardinia in july .
alarming data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimates one billion people live in hunger according to draft copies of the final declaration obtained by the german press agency dpa and reuters news agency , the ministers acknowledged past failures in the fight against world hunger .
" the millennium declaration aimed to halve the proportion of the world population facing poverty and undernourishment by the year 2015 , " the draft declaration said .
" we are very far from reaching this goal , " the document said , referring to " alarming data " from the united nations , which estimates that one billion people are currently living in poverty and hunger .
the draft stated that the volatility of agricultural commodity prices , which rose sharply in 2008 only to fall again amid the global economic downturn , exacerbated the problem of hunger and threatened farmers ' incomes .
" structural factors may underpin prices over the medium term and increased volatility and demand raise important questions about food security for the future , " it said .
grain stocks ?
the draft document stressed the need to increase food production , but it offered no clear instructions on how to do so , other than to " underline the importance of increased public and private investment in sustainable agriculture , rural development and environmental protection . "
while the draft mentioned the need to examine " food stocks " as a tool to help reduce market volatility , it was unclear how the concept would be addressed in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and italy say grain reserves would curb speculation on food markets french agriculture minister michel barnier told reporters he would push for a global system for stockpiling essential foodstuffs .
barnier said the world needed supply management systems similar to those that operate across the european union , with reserves that " fight against speculators preying on primary foodstuffs , which is scandalous . "
but the us and some of the other countries have warned against such a reserve system , arguing it is not an ideal policy tool for stabilizing prices .
quantity vs quality while italian agriculture minister luca zaia said talks aimed at reducing trade barriers took place in a " good climate " , he admitted that further " compromise " was needed to smooth over differences .
zaia hinted that the custom and import duties on agricultural products , as well as " quality standards , " remained a sticking point between the g8 nations and those representing the g5 emerging economies - china , india , brazil , mexico , south africa - which joined an extended session of the talks on saturday evening .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian agriculture minister luca zaia says g8 talks on food security are moving forward these poorer nations have frequently accused richer countries of using " standards " to shield their home markets from cheaper , imported foodstuffs .
however , on sunday , zaia reiterated his view that while food security consists of producing a sufficient quantity of foodstuffs to feed people , the other component , quality , must be protected by standards that prevent the sale of products that threaten people 's health .
zaia said although a single final declaration would " ideally " incorporate the views of the g8 , the g5 , and other important agricultural exporters such as australia , egypt and argentina , his priority was to reach an agreement within the g8 framework . sje / nrt dpa / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

besides karstadt stores , the essen-based company also owns mail-order firms quelle and primondo and travel firm thomas cook .
while eick indicated that the company was rethinking its mail order business , he said there were no plans to part with thomas cook .

the 1989 song foreshadowed the fall of the iron curtain , taking on special meaning for many in both the east and west . deutsche welle : why have you stayed in hanover ?
many stars choose to move to la or new york , yet you have chosen to stay in a relatively small german city .
klaus meine : the most important thing is to have a place you can come back to , where your roots , family and friends are .
those are things you ca n't transplant .
we 're cosmopolitan and have been traveling around the world for so many years .
wherever we are , the music helps us to feel connected and we never really feel like strangers , whether we 're in siberia or the amazon .
but it 's really important to be able to come back to the place where your roots are , where your family and friends are .
you recently received an echo music award for your life 's work .
does that make you feel old ?
no , not at all .
we 're very honored .
the echo is a very important award and it 's a big honor to receive one . we do n't see it as a final cadence , but rather as an incentive , or motivation to keep playing for our fans in the coming years and to do that which has kept us going for so many years - that is , living our dream of making rock music .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scorpions won an echo in february in berlin what are you currently working on ?
we 're working in the studio at the moment and preparing a new project .
after a very turbulent 2008 with 60 shows in 22 countries , we 're now trying to breathe a bit and charge our batteries - but also to be creative .
we 're working on new songs that will hopefully come out towards the end of the year .
that 's really a lot of fun , after doing all those concerts .
" wind of change , " one of your best-known songs , became something of hymn for political change in eastern europe .
was the song conceived as something of an ode to perestroika ?
of course not .
when you write a song , you might have a certain feeling about it , but you can never be sure how a song is going to develop and what will become of it - if it will become a top ten hit , a number one hit , or in this case even an international hit that became like a hymn to the end of the cold war for many people from east and west .
something like that ca n't be imagined or planned .
the only thing i did was try to express in the music all the emotions and everything we experienced in 1988 and 1989 .
we really had the feeling that the world was changing before our eyes - at the latest in august 1989 in moscow .
we had the feeling that the cold war could be over soon , but of course no one thought that the berlin wall would fall just a few months later and that so much in our own country , germany , and in eastern europe would change .
so this song has a particularly special story , which goes way beyond just being a " hit . "
it 's a nice feeling to know that the song touched so many people and , for many , will always be associated with these historical events .
do you feel a special connection to russia ?
we have fans in many different parts of the world , who we have a special connection with .
but we have a particularly special relationship with the russian fans .
i think it goes back to the soviet union , back to 1988 , when we were one of the first bands to play in leningrad .
some of the fans traveled for 20 hours by train from siberia and even further to see the scorpions .
and of course the legendary moscow music peace festival in moscow in 1989 was a special moment in rock history .
we 've also gone back to russia again and again .
less than two years ago , you were invited to play in moscow on the 90th anniversary of the russian secret service .
prime minister vladimir putin , who was president at that time , was at the concert .
what is your opinion of him and his policies ?
i 'd rather leave it to the politicians to make a judgement on putin and his policies .
but i know that putin is very popular in russia , especially among the young people .
whenever we 're on tour in russia , we get the feeling that he 's adored like a pop star , particularly by the younger generation .
that event in the kremlin where we were invited to play was a television show that was broadcast across russia .
we and a few russia artists were n't the only performers ; carlos santana and patricia kaas were also there .
the scorpions will be touring russia again in june 2009 .

world affairs editor john simpson has just returned from a visit to marange , in eastern zimbabwe , which contains the largest known concentration of diamonds in the world .
some 68 illegal diamond diggers were buried in a mass grave until six months ago the marange diamond fields were occupied by hundreds of illegal local diggers .
the diamonds were easy to find .
they either lay on the surface or just a few feet below .
the diggers sold them to dealers in nearby town of mutare , who smuggled them out of the country .
then on 31 october , we were told , the government moved in .
helicopter gunships , soldiers and police were sent to attack the illegal diggers .
at least 150 of them were killed .
according to survivors we spoke to , some of them were set on by police dogs and torn apart .
army control senior sources in the capital , harare , insisted that an operation on this scale could only have been authorised by president robert mugabe himself .
robert mugabe 's closest supporters thrive as a result of illegal diamonds now the diamond fields at marange are under the control of the army , and the roads around it are guarded by police road-blocks .
it proved to be very hard for us to film the diamond fields for the bbc , though in the end we managed it .
yet , as it turned out , the purpose of the operation was not to take over the diamond diggings in order to provide revenue for zimbabwe 's almost empty treasury .

posing as holy men , they prey on britain 's religious asian community and those facing hardship or health trouble , and falsely promise to solve their problems in return for large sums of money .
look in almost any asian newspaper or glossy magazine and you will find advert after advert for spiritual healers , or peers .
it 's an industry which is condemned by mainstream religions , including islam , but is thriving nonetheless .
i was contacted more than a year ago by someone , who we 'll call mohammed , who put his faith in one of these men after seeing an advert in his daily newspaper .
he told the bbc : " i had a problem , a family problem , and i saw the advert for haji imam .
it said he could solve any problem within three days . "
mohammed , a glasgow taxi driver , called the number in the advert .
the man on the end of the phone said he could help him , and all mohammed had to do was send some personal items including a lock of hair and a toenail , along with £ 130 in cash in a jiffy bag and send it recorded delivery to a po box .
" but then he said he was having difficulty with my problem and needed more money , another £ 750 , " he said .
" i was desperate to have my problem sorted so i sent it . "
and it did n't end there .
over the next six months , haji imam persuaded mohammed to part with more than £ 10,000 .
when he realised he 'd been conned , the so-called holy man turned nasty .
mohammed said : " haji imam said to me , i know you are a taxi driver , if you do n't stop phoning me i can make accident for you .
i was scared . "
i tried to find out this haji imam was , and managed to trace his po box address to leicester .
mustafa malik , spokesperson for the islamic centre in leicester , said that bogus spiritual healers were a disgrace to islam and that it was a widespread problem in leicester 's asian community .
mr malik said : " this is a huge industry , in which these men are conning people , simple people , who find themselves in some sort of difficult situation .
" there are some out there who genuinely believe they have healing powers , but they do not charge for it .
" as soon as someone tries to make profit , you can be 100 % guaranteed that it is a fraud . "
trading standards told the bbc it was impossible to estimate how big the problem was because people were often too embarrassed or scared to come forward .
however , i learned that haji imam was receiving packages almost every day to his po box address in leicester .
i wanted to confront this fraudster , who by now had changed personas and was advertising his services in the same newspaper as peer jalal shah .
' a curse ' i enlisted the help of an urdu-speaking colleague .
armed with a completely made up problem about her failure to conceive a male child , she called him up .
and , soon , he was promising to help solve an imaginary problem .
he told her : " by the grace of god everything can be done for you .
it is not that this is not in your destiny .
it 's just that there is a curse upon you .
" by the grace of god you will conceive a child .
and by the grace of god we will also ensure you will have a boy . "
for this minor miracle , he wanted the princely sum of £ 480 deposited in a bank account .
we sent him nothing , of course , but i learned the name of one of the men behind this scam , khalid rafique , an asian man in his early 30s .
i found out where he lived , and which address he was channelling the money through .
but when i turned up at the addresses - both in leicester - to confront him , unsurprisingly , no-one was home .
so i decided to contact him in the same way as his victims and simply call him up .
he denied being a conman and demanding money from people , despite the bbc having recorded several phone calls with him in which he did exactly that .
he then hung up on me .
the newspaper in which he advertised has told the bbc it will no longer accept his business .
police have urged anyone who has fallen for this type of scam to get in touch .
the bbc has passed the details of this case to trading standards which has pledged to investigate , and we are making our dossier available to the police .

posing as holy men , they prey on britain 's religious asian community and those facing hardship or health trouble , and falsely promise to solve their problems in return for large sums of money .
look in almost any asian newspaper or glossy magazine and you will find advert after advert for spiritual healers , or peers .
it 's an industry which is condemned by mainstream religions , including islam , but is thriving nonetheless .
i was contacted more than a year ago by someone , who we 'll call mohammed , who put his faith in one of these men after seeing an advert in his daily newspaper .
he told the bbc : " i had a problem , a family problem , and i saw the advert for haji imam .
it said he could solve any problem within three days . "
mohammed , a glasgow taxi driver , called the number in the advert .
mohammed said he was threatened when he confronted haji imam the man on the end of the phone said he could help him , and all mohammed had to do was send some personal items including a lock of hair and a toenail , along with £ 130 in cash in a jiffy bag and send it recorded delivery to a po box .
" but then he said he was having difficulty with my problem and needed more money , another £ 750 , " he said .
" i was desperate to have my problem sorted so i sent it . "
and it did n't end there .
over the next six months , haji imam persuaded mohammed to part with more than £ 10,000 .
when he realised he 'd been conned , the so-called holy man turned nasty .
mohammed said : " haji imam said to me , i know you are a taxi driver , if you do n't stop phoning me i can make accident for you .
i was scared . "
i tried to find out this haji imam was , and managed to trace his po box address to leicester .
mustafa malik , spokesperson for the islamic centre in leicester , said that bogus spiritual healers were a disgrace to islam and that it was a widespread problem in leicester 's asian community .
mustafa malik said the conmen were exploiting vulnerable people mr malik said : " this is a huge industry , in which these men are conning people , simple people , who find themselves in some sort of difficult situation .
" there are some out there who genuinely believe they have healing powers , but they do not charge for it .
" as soon as someone tries to make profit , you can be 100 % guaranteed that it is a fraud . "
trading standards told the bbc it was impossible to estimate how big the problem was because people were often too embarrassed or scared to come forward .
however , i learned that haji imam was receiving packages almost every day to his po box address in leicester .
i wanted to confront this fraudster , who by now had changed personas and was advertising his services in the same newspaper as peer jalal shah .
' a curse ' i enlisted the help of an urdu-speaking colleague .
armed with a completely made up problem about her failure to conceive a male child , she called him up .
and , soon , he was promising to help solve an imaginary problem .
he told her : " by the grace of god everything can be done for you .
it is not that this is not in your destiny .
it 's just that there is a curse upon you .
" by the grace of god you will conceive a child .
and by the grace of god we will also ensure you will have a boy . "
for this minor miracle , he wanted the princely sum of £ 480 deposited in a bank account .
bbc scotland 's mark daly tries to speak to khalid rafique in leicester we sent him nothing , of course , but i learned the name of one of the men behind this scam , khalid rafique , an asian man in his early 30s .
i found out where he lived , and which address he was channelling the money through .
but when i turned up at the addresses - both in leicester - to confront him , unsurprisingly , no-one was home .
so i decided to contact him in the same way as his victims and simply call him up .
he denied being a conman and demanding money from people , despite the bbc having recorded several phone calls with him in which he did exactly that .
he then hung up on me .
the newspaper in which he advertised has told the bbc it will no longer accept his business .
police have urged anyone who has fallen for this type of scam to get in touch .
the bbc has passed the details of this case to trading standards which has pledged to investigate , and we are making our dossier available to the police .

brand made the call during a two-hour football special , co-hosted with oasis guitarist noel gallagher , aired on talksport radio on sunday evening .
" you 're not back on the radio , are you ? " listeners will hear ross say .
ross and brand were heavily censured last year for leaving lewd messages on actor andrew sachs ' answering machine .
brand quit his radio 2 show as a result , while ross was suspended from the bbc for three months .
earlier this month the bbc was fined £ 150,000 by media watchdog ofcom for their " offensive , humiliating and demeaning " conduct .
' cutting-edge comedy ' in the show , recorded in london on saturday , listeners heard gallagher accuse ross and brand of failing to learn their lessons .
ross was heard telling gallagher : " we 'll listen to it very carefully before it goes out .
ross was suspended for three months for his part in the sachs affair " noel , you can sit back and be the grown-up one . "
in another part of the programme , brand was heard leaving a message for barack obama in a bid to find out if the us president is a west ham united fan .
the one-off show could become a regular fixture if it proves successful with talksport listeners .

jeeves was dropped from the brand in 2006 as the search engine began a series of facelifts aimed at increasing market share and gaining on google .
at the time there was a brief campaign from users to have him reinstated .
ask says the return of the valet , based on a character created by pg wodehouse , is in response to " user demand " .
managing director cesar mascaraque denied the rethink was a last-ditch effort to gain ground on market leader google .
" we have seen a growth of 20 % this year , so we are not struggling , " he said .
" we have been focused on developing an outstanding producer that will deliver outstanding results and jeeves is just the icing on the cake .
" our aim is to give our users the answers they need for the lives they lead and jeeves 's role is to give our users answers in a more human way . "
but peter matthews , manager of the brand and digital consultancy nucleus , said ask needed to put some clear blue water between itself and google .
ask without jeeves lacked character and while the actual product - searching the web - is very effective , in trying to be more like google they shot themselves in the foot nucleus manager , peter matthews " ask is struggling , as all search engines other than google are , " he said .
" with google , you get 90 % of the market , so the other search engines - yahoo , msn , aol , ask to name but a few - are all trying to grab a share of the remaining 10 % . "
the search engine has been through a series of rebrands , including a tv advertising campaign portraying it as an underground alternative to google .
in the autumn of 2008 it had another makeover , this time branding itself as the search engine that could best answer specific questions .
mr matthews added : " ask jeeves was quite a strong brand , in the sense it had brand values that were different from everyone else .
" ask without jeeves lacked character and while the actual product - searching the web - is very effective , in trying to be more like google they shot themselves in the foot .
" the opportunity for jeeves would be to get the site to be used as it was first intended - not by putting in a few key words , but by asking it a proper question .
" not only have they got a brand issue , but they need to be famous for answering questions rather than producing reams of search results . "

" with google , you get 90 % of the market , so the other search engines - yahoo , msn , aol , ask to name but a few - are all trying to grab a share of the remaining 10 % . "
the search engine has been through a series of rebrands , including a tv advertising campaign portraying it as an underground alternative to google .
in the autumn of 2008 it had another makeover , this time branding itself as the search engine that could best answer specific questions .
mr matthews added : " ask jeeves was quite a strong brand , in the sense it had brand values that were different from everyone else .
" ask without jeeves lacked character and while the actual product - searching the web - is very effective , in trying to be more like google they shot themselves in the foot .
" the opportunity for jeeves would be to get the site to be used as it was first intended - not by putting in a few key words , but by asking it a proper question .
" not only have they got a brand issue , but they need to be famous for answering questions rather than producing reams of search results . "
