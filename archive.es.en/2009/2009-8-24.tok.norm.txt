" the left party is entering these elections aspiring to take part in the formation of governments , and it is prepared to lead these governments , " the homepage reads .
though it was founded in 2005 under the name electoral alternative for labor and social justice , the left party has apparently shed its oppositional position and is beginning to feel strong enough to test its socialist agenda in government . despite ostensible successes at a regional level and a clear national profile in the media , the left party is still regarded as political poison by its rivals in the west of the country – any hint that a politician might harbor fantasies of a coalition with the left generally ignites a round of indignation .
the left 's position as the direct successors of the party of democratic socialism and by extension the ruling party of former east germany , the sed , is still a stigma . problematic past part of this reputation is down to the controversial past of gregor gysi , co-chairman of the left 's parliamentary group .
a member of the sed since 1967 , gysi rose to prominence around the time of germany 's reunification , playing an instrumental part in the internal re-organization of the sed and its reinvention as the pds , of which he became the first party chairman .

much of its success in the west depends on oskar lafontaine , the high-profile spd defector whose pugnacious media presence has given the party its recent national profile . social and economic policy lafontaine 's statements , such as " we want to overthrow capitalism , " in an interview with der spiegel in may 2009 , frequently give the impression that the party deliberately fosters this provocative anti-establishment image .
but its policies , though radical , are not anti-democratic . central to its economic policy is a keynesian use of state intervention to balance market forces .

now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .
they are determined to scrap germany 's compulsory military service -lrb- germany is one of the few remaining nato countries with a conscripted army -rrb- , and to reduce the size of the army generally .
they also want to seize the initiative of us president barack obama 's election to push for better relations with iran and north korea .
the green party is also the german party with the most faith in the european union and would like to see the eu 's profile raised in the world . author : ben knight editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .
they are determined to scrap germany 's compulsory military service -lrb- germany is one of the few remaining nato countries with a conscripted army -rrb- , and to reduce the size of the army generally .
they also want to seize the initiative of us president barack obama 's election to push for better relations with iran and north korea .

but if recent state level success continues , the left party will become difficult to ignore . a glance at the left party 's website shows where its priorities and its ambitions lie .
" the left party is entering these elections aspiring to take part in the formation of governments , and it is prepared to lead these governments , " the homepage reads .
though it was founded in 2005 under the name electoral alternative for labor and social justice , the left party has apparently shed its oppositional position and is beginning to feel strong enough to test its socialist agenda in government . despite ostensible successes at a regional level and a clear national profile in the media , the left party is still regarded as political poison by its rivals in the west of the country – any hint that a politician might harbor fantasies of a coalition with the left generally ignites a round of indignation .
the left 's position as the direct successors of the party of democratic socialism and by extension the ruling party of former east germany , the sed , is still a stigma . problematic past part of this reputation is down to the controversial past of gregor gysi , co-chairman of the left 's parliamentary group .
a member of the sed since 1967 , gysi rose to prominence around the time of germany 's reunification , playing an instrumental part in the internal re-organization of the sed and its reinvention as the pds , of which he became the first party chairman .
his charisma and rhetorical gift made him an important leader of the left party , but his record has been stained recently by accusations that he was an informant for the east german secret police , the stasi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi has been both a popular and shadowy element in the left 's leadership after steadily improving election results throughout the 1990s , the pds / left party managed to enter coalition governments , or support spd-led minority governments , in a few states in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
much of its success in the west depends on oskar lafontaine , the high-profile spd defector whose pugnacious media presence has given the party its recent national profile . social and economic policy lafontaine 's statements , such as " we want to overthrow capitalism , " in an interview with der spiegel in may 2009 , frequently give the impression that the party deliberately fosters this provocative anti-establishment image .
but its policies , though radical , are not anti-democratic . central to its economic policy is a keynesian use of state intervention to balance market forces .
in the current election program , this includes socializing the entire banking system , outlawing non-transparent financial products , hedge funds , and venture capitalism , and restricting currency markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reversing schroeder 's social welfare reforms has been a unifying cause in the left party on a social level , the left 's economic plan would mean the introduction of a minimum hourly wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14.30 -rrb- , raising top-rate income tax from 42 percent to 53 percent , and scrapping the hartz iv unemployment benefit reforms introduced under gerhard schroeder 's government .
as a stop-gap during this transition , the left would raise long-term unemployment benefit , currently at 345 euros a month , to 500 euros , raise child benefit to 200 euros a month , and introduce a minimum pension of 800 euros . there would be a similar spending spree in education .
the left would not only ditch university tuition fees , but would redirect a full 7 percent of germany 's gross domestic product into education .
the three-tier , ability-based school system would also be abandoned in favor of a universal school until 10th grade . energy goals the left also has a decidedly green agenda on the environment , seeing fossil fuels and nuclear energy as relics of the 20th century .
like the green party , it hopes to switch germany onto renewable energies , though with a slightly more conservative timeframe than the greens , eventually lowering germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent by 2050 . but the left party takes a harder line on nuclear power , for which it believes the safety risks are unacceptable .
if in power , the party would demand that all nuclear power plants be shut down as soon as possible , and would introduce a ban on exporting nuclear technology . foreign and security policy on foreign policy and security issues , the left party is equally uncompromising .
it demands an immediate withdrawal of the german army from afghanistan , and in fact would end all german army missions abroad .
on top of this , the left party would like to see nato replaced by a collective security organization with russia as a member . in the question of internal security , the left party perhaps belies its roots in the dictatorial gdr .
in power , it would end the new anti-terrorist powers granted to the police , for example , banning remote online searches and the storage of personal data .
it would also ban the far-right national democratic party , lower the voting age to 16 , and introduce voting rights for immigrants . author : ben knight editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if recent state level success continues , the left party will become difficult to ignore . a glance at the left party 's website shows where its priorities and its ambitions lie .
" the left party is entering these elections aspiring to take part in the formation of governments , and it is prepared to lead these governments , " the homepage reads .
though it was founded in 2005 under the name electoral alternative for labor and social justice , the left party has apparently shed its oppositional position and is beginning to feel strong enough to test its socialist agenda in government . despite ostensible successes at a regional level and a clear national profile in the media , the left party is still regarded as political poison by its rivals in the west of the country – any hint that a politician might harbor fantasies of a coalition with the left generally ignites a round of indignation .
the left 's position as the direct successors of the party of democratic socialism and by extension the ruling party of former east germany , the sed , is still a stigma . problematic past part of this reputation is down to the controversial past of gregor gysi , co-chairman of the left 's parliamentary group .

now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .
they are determined to scrap germany 's compulsory military service -lrb- germany is one of the few remaining nato countries with a conscripted army -rrb- , and to reduce the size of the army generally .
they also want to seize the initiative of us president barack obama 's election to push for better relations with iran and north korea .

but that has n't necessarily boosted the spd ’ s credibility . germany 's oldest political party , the spd , set out in 1875 to become an advocate of the working class and all underprivileged people in society .
although the party officially rebranded itself as a " party of the people " – and not just the working class – in 1959 , it 's still widely associated with being a defender of social justice and equality .
in postwar germany , the spd was also for a long time the largest party , ruling the country between 1969 and 1982 and then again between 1998 and 2005 .
but since 2005 , it has been stuck in a reluctant grand coalition with the conservatives , and that has seen the party ’ s membership and popularity ratings enter a free fall .
current opinion polls see the social democrats trailing the conservative cdu by a wide margin .
in a desperate race to regain lost ground ahead of the general election , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , surprised the media with a headline-grabbing promise incorporated in the party ’ s manifesto .

but that has n't necessarily boosted the spd ’ s credibility . germany 's oldest political party , the spd , set out in 1875 to become an advocate of the working class and all underprivileged people in society .
although the party officially rebranded itself as a " party of the people " – and not just the working class – in 1959 , it 's still widely associated with being a defender of social justice and equality .
in postwar germany , the spd was also for a long time the largest party , ruling the country between 1969 and 1982 and then again between 1998 and 2005 .
but since 2005 , it has been stuck in a reluctant grand coalition with the conservatives , and that has seen the party ’ s membership and popularity ratings enter a free fall .
current opinion polls see the social democrats trailing the conservative cdu by a wide margin .
in a desperate race to regain lost ground ahead of the general election , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , surprised the media with a headline-grabbing promise incorporated in the party ’ s manifesto .
he announced that the social democrats would create four million new jobs over the next decade , which – if seen against current jobless levels – would mean that the country could boast full employment 10 years from now .
fiscal and environmental policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd hopeful frank-walter steinmeier mingling with coal miners in germany in a bid to lure away voters both from the green and far-left spectrum of the political landscape , the spd in its " plan for germany " says its program to foster energy-saving and environmentally-friendly industries could employ two million people .
another million would be needed in the health system and especially geriatric care as the population ages dramatically .
the remaining one million jobs would emerge in the service and trade sector .
the party has faced massive criticism from other political players who insist that creating four million new jobs is totally unrealistic .
in terms of energy policy , the spd wants to reduce the country 's dependence on oil and get half of its power from renewable sources by 2030 .
its position on nuclear energy remains unchanged .
the social democrats stick to what they agreed while governing with the green party – the complete phase-out of nuclear power , meaning the decommissioning of all remaining nuclear power stations in the country by 2020 .
referring to the current economic crisis and the mounting public debt burden , germany 's spd is categorically opposed to any major tax cuts in the next legislature .
it actually plans to raise the top rate of taxation for big earners to 47 percent from 45 percent of incomes at present .
on the other hand , it promises an income tax bonus of 300 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- for people who do not file a claim for rebates .
this is not a nice social gesture , but rather an attempt to cut red tape .
defender of social justice the spd is hoping to appeal to families by offering to raise the tax break for each child per household by 200 euros .
the party has also presented itself as a passionate fighter for a minimum wage of 7.50 euros per hour across all sectors of the economy .

the spd also repeats its demand that first degrees at universities and colleges should not be subject to study fees which are currently in place in a number of cdu-governed german states .
foreign policy on the foreign policy front , the spd likes to portray itself as a party that banks on diplomacy rather than military intervention .
the issue of germany 's peacekeeping missions abroad under united nations mandates has led to many a heated debate within both the leadership and the rank and file .

it was senior spd member peter struck who , in his former capacity as the country 's defense minister , claimed that germany 's interests had to be defended at the hindu kush .
many spd members would n't necessarily subscribe to this point of view any longer , as the war against the taliban continues with a numerous setbacks for nato allies .
steinmeier insists , however , that reconstruction in afghanistan remains a top priority and will need to be secured militarily in future .
but he says that german troops will withdraw from afghanistan sometime within the next decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's top candidates angela merkel : from shy physicist to re-elected stateswoman guido westerwelle : resurrecting germany 's liberals frank-walter steinmeier : uphill battle for the chancellery oskar lafontaine : populist rebel of the left politics -pipe- 24.08.2009 the green party : getting used to opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens promise a way out of the financial and climate crises having spent seven years in government with the social democratic party , the greens had to use the last legislature creating a meaningful opposition to its former partner .
now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .
they are determined to scrap germany 's compulsory military service -lrb- germany is one of the few remaining nato countries with a conscripted army -rrb- , and to reduce the size of the army generally .
they also want to seize the initiative of us president barack obama 's election to push for better relations with iran and north korea .
the green party is also the german party with the most faith in the european union and would like to see the eu 's profile raised in the world . author : ben knight editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but macaskill , who freed abdel basset al-megrahi on compassionate grounds because he is dying of prostate cancer , criticized libya for the celebrations that greeted his return to tripoli .
" a decision had to be made , " macaskill told parliament in edinburgh , the scottish capital .
“ it was based on the law of scotland , and the values i believe we seek to uphold .
it was not based on political , diplomatic or economic considerations . "
" i stand by it and live with the consequences , " macaskill said .
" showing mercy is not a sign of weakness ...
it is a source of pride for many scots and will be accepted by large parts of the international community , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macaskill says showing mercy is not a sign of weakness relatives of us victims have strongly condemned the decision to release 57-year-old megrahi , the only person ever convicted of the 1988 bombing of a pan am jet over the scottish town of lockerbie , killing 270 people , 189 of them americans .
megrahi flew home from scotland on thursday and was greeted in the libyan capital by more than 1,000 people cheering and waving libyan and scottish flags .
" a matter of great regret " macaskill said he had sought a promise from libya that it would handle megrahi 's return in a sensitive way .
" it is a matter of great regret that mr al-megrahi was received in such an inappropriate manner , " he said .
" assurances had been given by the libyan government that any return would be dealt with in a low-key and sensitive fashion . "
the british government has denied wanting megrahi to be freed to bolster diplomatic and commercial ties with libya , which has the biggest oil reserves in africa .
oil giants bp and royal dutch shell have signed big exploration deals with libya .
critics say the british government has allowed the scottish authorities , who have devolved powers and a separate legal system , to take the blame for the release and has chosen not to make its own position clear .
a spokesman for prime minister gordon brown , whose ruling labour party lost to the scottish national party in elections in scotland in 2007 , made no comment on the decision other than to say it was a matter for the devolved scottish government .
us president barack obama said megrahi 's warm welcome in libya was " highly objectionable , ” while fbi director robert mueller wrote to macaskill , saying his actions had made a mockery of the rule of law and " given comfort to terrorists . "
the british government on monday rejected the claim. ch / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more planes were due to arrive later monday and tuesday from spain and turkey .
in addition , the eu mobilized two further planes from its european tactical reserve of fire-fighting aircraft -lrb- eufftr -rrb- , said mann .
established to assist eu member states that face major fires , the eufftr makes planes available during the summer in a project costing 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and eu countries have sent in planes to help put out the flames " they are being financed by the eu and have been leased from july 1 to september 30 , " mann said .
" the idea is to help member states with their own efforts . "
the two eu fire fighting planes are stationed on corsica , putting them close to both france and italy and almost exactly halfway between lisbon and athens , according to the european commission .
the planes have already been dispatched five times this summer ; most recently to battle the fires in portugal a few weeks ago .
residents fight flames alongside firefighters working round the clock , firefighters managed to contain all but six major fires burning across greece .
ongoing fires include those on the islands of evia , skyros and on the ionian island of zakynthos .
" we are making progress in limiting the fires , " said fire brigade chief yiannis kappakis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many residents failed to heed the evacuation warning until the fires were too close blazes were still spreading further to the north of athens near the coastal towns of pikermi , porto germano and nea makri , where rescue crews managed to evacuate a dozen nuns safely from an endangered monastery as fires raced down the hill towards them .
the wildfires , which started in the early hours of saturday , swept through homes , caused massive evacuations of entire towns and destroyed more than 40,000 acres -lrb- 16,190 hectares -rrb- of forest and olives groves .
a state of emergency was in effect for days as reinforcements and military personnel were called in .
many athenians who ignored calls to evacuate their neighborhoods could be seen fighting the flames outside their homes with water hoses and branches .
others , armed with shovels and buckets , worked side by side with firefighters and soldiers throughout the night to battle the fires .
at least half a dozen people were being treated for minor burns and breathing problems , the health ministry said monday .
bildunterschrift : fires have been burning since saturday prime minister criticized over response even as prime minister costas karamanlis toured the fire-affected areas , he faced harsh criticism for the poor handling of the fires .
opposition party leaders and mayors said the response resembled that when fires struck the island of evia and the peloponnese in 2007 , killing more than 80 people .
mayors across the are around athens made frantic calls to greek television stations asking for firefighters to be sent to their communities , insisting their was no central body in place to respond to their requests .
" there are still huge shortages in the firefighting infrastructure which should have been looked after following the fires two years ago , " said aleka papariga , leader of the communist party of greece .

the newspaper then cited sources familiar with the company as saying it " would take a miracle " for any of the shareholders to see their money again .
that includes schickedanz , whose shares in karstadt-quelle - as arcandor was formerly known - were once valued at some three billion euros .
other stakeholders include the sal .
oppenheim private bank , which invested hundreds of millions of euros in the company last year , as well as thousands of small investors , who together own about 51 percent of arcandor stock .
no funds for a rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competing retailers are keen to cherry-pick arcandor 's most valuable assets arcandor is expected to enter liquidation once insolvency proceedings are officially launched on september 1 .
while administrators initially planned on using bankruptcy laws to allow arcandor managers to reorganize the company , major shareholders including schickedanz and sal .
oppenheim refused to pump any more cash into the troubled company .
the luxembourg-based bank has itself been struggling with the effects of the global economic downturn .
earlier this month it turned to deutsche bank for a 300-million-euro capital injection .
madeleine schickedanz , meanwhile , seemed to predict her financial downfall in an interview she held with the bild am sonntag newspaper last month .
" if the rescue of arcandor fails and the banks call in their loans , i 'll lose everything - houses , shares , interests in other firms .
at 65 years of age i wo n't even be eligible for a state pension , " she told the newspaper , adding that she had already cut back her expenditure on clothing and cosmetics .
" i save where i can .
we 're living on 500 to 600 euros a month , and shopping at discount supermarkets , " she said .
partial sale not an option as proceedings continue , administrators have ruled out the splitting up assets belonging to arcandor 's department store unit karstadt , effectively ruling out partial sales to competing retailers such as metro and sportscheck .
" we consider karstadt a company that can survive on its own , " weidmann told handelsblatt .
meanwhile , the newspaper cited thomas fox , a retail expert involved in overhauling karstadt ahead of a future sale , as saying the company had received important concessions from a number of landlords and suppliers .

opel 's future is hanging by a thread , and its bankrupt parent company , us carmaker general motors , seems happy to keep it that way for the time being .
dw 's karl zawadzky comments . no decision is , in fact , a decision .
the future of the ailing car maker opel is still up in the air , threatened by the ongoing german election and the outlook for new difficulties in the company 's fortunes . the german government and the governments of the german three states with opel subsidiaries can clamor as much as they want : opel 's parent company , general motors , continues to drag out the game .
having filed for bankruptcy as quickly as possible , the american car giant 's detroit managers are giving themselves time to decide the future of their european business - and the fate of its german unit . but pressure is building .
some 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.15 billion -rrb- of german tax money that went into saving opel from bankruptcy will be used up by the end of this year .
worse , the government-sponsored " wrecking-premium , " that allowed people to trade clunkers for cash towards a new car , will run out in a few weeks - and that scheme had given a serious boost to opel sales in germany .
that means even more difficult times are ahead for opel , since despite the wrecking premium , opel has continued to post losses in the millions . time for the next choice soon enough , the german government and the affected states will face a choice : let opel declare bankruptcy , or give it another cash injection in the billions . the american parent was reorganized under bankruptcy protection and with the aid of many billions of dollars from washington .
once the largest company in the world , gm now belongs to the us taxpayer .
and now , its managers in detroit are in no hurry to make a decision .
there are even some indications that they wo n't bother to sell their european activities at all - but will instead try to use european taxpayer monies and do the reorganizing job themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky in any case , it certainly looks as if the americans do n't plan to sell gm 's european car business to the preferred german suitor : a consortium made up of canadian-austrian car-parts maker magna , russia 's sberbank , and russian automaker gaz .
maintaining a minority stake in opel would keep general motors ' hand in the european market .
gm sees itself as an international car maker , and wants to maintain a presence in europe .
this is why the management in detroit would prefer it if investment firm rhj , which is taking a majority stake in opel , would take over the company , reorganize it , and sell it back to gm . moreover , its worth bearing in mind that if opel were to leave the gm group permanently , it would be bad news for gm : opel is the company 's center for development of small cars and engines - in other words , the future of general motors . competition from the russians general motors is extremely critical of the russian involvement in the magna consortium .
for the russians , taking over opel would be a milestone on the road to bringing the decaying russian auto industry up to a european level .
meanwhile , general motors itself wants to build and sell cars in russia .
it has no interest in giving the competition a boost in this important market . gm is playing for time , and it is putting pressure on the german government and the states .
at the same time , it is also an attempt to avoid turning this extremely unpopular issue into grist for the electoral mill in the coming parliamentary elections .
in other words , it wo n't be until after the elections that gm will say what will become of opel . the germans could be ramping up the pressure , of course .
gm no longer holds the majority stake in opel ; it is held by five trustees , including two americans and one german , as well as a chairman who wo n't take part in the conflict .
all together that means that even if there was a blockade , there would be no decision .
it would be a sure path to bankruptcy for opel , and perhaps not the worst choice .
in that case , the bankruptcy administrator would simply sell opel to the highest bidder .

opel 's future is hanging by a thread , and its bankrupt parent company , us carmaker general motors , seems happy to keep it that way for the time being .
dw 's karl zawadzky comments . no decision is , in fact , a decision .
the future of the ailing car maker opel is still up in the air , threatened by the ongoing german election and the outlook for new difficulties in the company 's fortunes . the german government and the governments of the german three states with opel subsidiaries can clamor as much as they want : opel 's parent company , general motors , continues to drag out the game .
having filed for bankruptcy as quickly as possible , the american car giant 's detroit managers are giving themselves time to decide the future of their european business - and the fate of its german unit . but pressure is building .
some 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.15 billion -rrb- of german tax money that went into saving opel from bankruptcy will be used up by the end of this year .
worse , the government-sponsored " wrecking-premium , " that allowed people to trade clunkers for cash towards a new car , will run out in a few weeks - and that scheme had given a serious boost to opel sales in germany .
that means even more difficult times are ahead for opel , since despite the wrecking premium , opel has continued to post losses in the millions . time for the next choice soon enough , the german government and the affected states will face a choice : let opel declare bankruptcy , or give it another cash injection in the billions . the american parent was reorganized under bankruptcy protection and with the aid of many billions of dollars from washington .
once the largest company in the world , gm now belongs to the us taxpayer .
and now , its managers in detroit are in no hurry to make a decision .
there are even some indications that they wo n't bother to sell their european activities at all - but will instead try to use european taxpayer monies and do the reorganizing job themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky in any case , it certainly looks as if the americans do n't plan to sell gm 's european car business to the preferred german suitor : a consortium made up of canadian-austrian car-parts maker magna , russia 's sberbank , and russian automaker gaz .
maintaining a minority stake in opel would keep general motors ' hand in the european market .
gm sees itself as an international car maker , and wants to maintain a presence in europe .
this is why the management in detroit would prefer it if investment firm rhj , which is taking a majority stake in opel , would take over the company , reorganize it , and sell it back to gm . moreover , its worth bearing in mind that if opel were to leave the gm group permanently , it would be bad news for gm : opel is the company 's center for development of small cars and engines - in other words , the future of general motors . competition from the russians general motors is extremely critical of the russian involvement in the magna consortium .
for the russians , taking over opel would be a milestone on the road to bringing the decaying russian auto industry up to a european level .
meanwhile , general motors itself wants to build and sell cars in russia .
it has no interest in giving the competition a boost in this important market . gm is playing for time , and it is putting pressure on the german government and the states .
at the same time , it is also an attempt to avoid turning this extremely unpopular issue into grist for the electoral mill in the coming parliamentary elections .
in other words , it wo n't be until after the elections that gm will say what will become of opel . the germans could be ramping up the pressure , of course .
gm no longer holds the majority stake in opel ; it is held by five trustees , including two americans and one german , as well as a chairman who wo n't take part in the conflict .
all together that means that even if there was a blockade , there would be no decision .
it would be a sure path to bankruptcy for opel , and perhaps not the worst choice .
in that case , the bankruptcy administrator would simply sell opel to the highest bidder .
and that is not necessarily us parent company gm . karl zawadzky is the head of deutsche welle 's economics bureau . -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 24.08.2009 " professors who jump the red light need to be prosecuted " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor margret wintermantel has been president of the german rectors ' conference since march 2006 the head of germany 's association of universities defends the country 's higher education system .
talking to dw , prof. wintermantel insists that professors taking money for accepting unfit students are an exception . about 100 teaching staff at german universities are under investigation by prosecutors for allegedly taking bribes from self-styled phd counselling services in return for accepting phd students not up to the job . the president of germany 's university rectors conference , professor margret wintermantel said in an interview with deutsche welle that corrupt acadmics have no place in the profession .
but insists that the problem lies with individuals , insisting that the german system of higher education is safe and sound . dw : professor wintermantel , when have phd counselling services contacted you the last time ? margret wintermantel : never actually .
neither have colleagues that i know personally .
none of them has ever mentioned to me anything of the sort . what is it that is questionable or even illegal about phd counselling agencies ? i think it is very important that a student who wants to get a phd has to deliver their own unique contribution to research .
if students , using these services , can not show that it is their own contribution with their own piece of research , then we have a problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professors at berlin 's free university are among those being investigated for corruption if students have used those services to get a supervisor , but have otherwise put together their work all by themselves , would they still have to worry about losing their phds ? no , they should not worry about that .
again , if they can show that they have carried out their own research then they should not worry about that .
at most universities students have to include a sworn declaration that what they are presenting is exclusively their own work unless stated otherwise .
the requirement to include this declaration is now standard in exam regulations at most german universities .
this is in fact also the result of a recommendation we made back in 1994 . prosecutors in cologne are investigating close to a hundred professors at german universities , and one phd counselling agency has essentially been shut down .
but there are many more out there .
one might be inclined to think this is just the tip of the iceberg … … no , i do n't think so .
and i want to be perfectly clear - i do n't think so at all .
there are a lot of procedures of quality assurance in the universities , especially when it comes to the question of unique contributions to research .
german universities have precise admissions regulations for phd candidates throughout , there is continuous supervision of phd students .
and of course we should not forget that phd theses get published and are being made accessible to the scientific community where they are and remain subject to intense scientific scrutiny .
so , i think , there is no iceberg . yes , there are some people who jump red lights and then this is a case for the authorities .
but by far most of the phd students do good work and their professors do good work in showing them how to do good research .
we have a problem with a few people , but it is not a problem of the system . most of the faculty members now under investigation are contract staff and associate professors , less so full university professors .
is this also a reflection of the precarious financial situation that many teachers find themselves in who are not fully part of the university hierarchy ? no .
our position is that a phd student should be supervised by a full university professor .
associate professors should not have a central role here .

talking to dw , prof. wintermantel insists that professors taking money for accepting unfit students are an exception . about 100 teaching staff at german universities are under investigation by prosecutors for allegedly taking bribes from self-styled phd counselling services in return for accepting phd students not up to the job . the president of germany 's university rectors conference , professor margret wintermantel said in an interview with deutsche welle that corrupt acadmics have no place in the profession .
but insists that the problem lies with individuals , insisting that the german system of higher education is safe and sound . dw : professor wintermantel , when have phd counselling services contacted you the last time ? margret wintermantel : never actually .
neither have colleagues that i know personally .
none of them has ever mentioned to me anything of the sort . what is it that is questionable or even illegal about phd counselling agencies ? i think it is very important that a student who wants to get a phd has to deliver their own unique contribution to research .
if students , using these services , can not show that it is their own contribution with their own piece of research , then we have a problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professors at berlin 's free university are among those being investigated for corruption if students have used those services to get a supervisor , but have otherwise put together their work all by themselves , would they still have to worry about losing their phds ? no , they should not worry about that .
again , if they can show that they have carried out their own research then they should not worry about that .
at most universities students have to include a sworn declaration that what they are presenting is exclusively their own work unless stated otherwise .
the requirement to include this declaration is now standard in exam regulations at most german universities .
this is in fact also the result of a recommendation we made back in 1994 . prosecutors in cologne are investigating close to a hundred professors at german universities , and one phd counselling agency has essentially been shut down .
but there are many more out there .
one might be inclined to think this is just the tip of the iceberg … … no , i do n't think so .
and i want to be perfectly clear - i do n't think so at all .
there are a lot of procedures of quality assurance in the universities , especially when it comes to the question of unique contributions to research .
german universities have precise admissions regulations for phd candidates throughout , there is continuous supervision of phd students .
and of course we should not forget that phd theses get published and are being made accessible to the scientific community where they are and remain subject to intense scientific scrutiny .
so , i think , there is no iceberg . yes , there are some people who jump red lights and then this is a case for the authorities .
but by far most of the phd students do good work and their professors do good work in showing them how to do good research .
we have a problem with a few people , but it is not a problem of the system . most of the faculty members now under investigation are contract staff and associate professors , less so full university professors .
is this also a reflection of the precarious financial situation that many teachers find themselves in who are not fully part of the university hierarchy ? no .
our position is that a phd student should be supervised by a full university professor .
associate professors should not have a central role here .
contract professors are entitled to supervise students and that is perfectly ok .
but to say ' i take bribes because i earn so little ' is totally unacceptable . is there a danger that the scandal could undermine the reputation of germany 's higher education system abroad and that in future fewer international students would chose to go for german universities ? if we insist on blowing this out of proportion - maybe .

and i want to be perfectly clear - i do n't think so at all .
there are a lot of procedures of quality assurance in the universities , especially when it comes to the question of unique contributions to research .
german universities have precise admissions regulations for phd candidates throughout , there is continuous supervision of phd students .
and of course we should not forget that phd theses get published and are being made accessible to the scientific community where they are and remain subject to intense scientific scrutiny .
so , i think , there is no iceberg . yes , there are some people who jump red lights and then this is a case for the authorities .
but by far most of the phd students do good work and their professors do good work in showing them how to do good research .
we have a problem with a few people , but it is not a problem of the system . most of the faculty members now under investigation are contract staff and associate professors , less so full university professors .
is this also a reflection of the precarious financial situation that many teachers find themselves in who are not fully part of the university hierarchy ? no .
our position is that a phd student should be supervised by a full university professor .
associate professors should not have a central role here .
contract professors are entitled to supervise students and that is perfectly ok .
but to say ' i take bribes because i earn so little ' is totally unacceptable . is there a danger that the scandal could undermine the reputation of germany 's higher education system abroad and that in future fewer international students would chose to go for german universities ? if we insist on blowing this out of proportion - maybe .
-lsb- at present -rsb- however our system of higher education , our phds , our degrees all do enjoy world wide recognition . interview : ranty islam editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the star detective solves crimes , the books carefully uncover even greater mysteries about wroclaw 's german history . when crime writer marek krajewski tours poland to meet with his readers , he attracts more fans than nearly any other polish author , which may be because krajewski is not the typical thriller writer . his dark detective novels are very original and feature the feisty , fiercely independent and lecherous inspector eberhardt mock .
krajewski is also a classical scholar with a penchant for latin verse , literary allusions , and above all , a love of the pre-world war ii history of the city of breslau - now called wroclaw - in south-western poland . fascination with the past growing up in wroclaw during the cold war , krajewski was intrigued to find out more about the city whose communist rulers had done their best to erase all traces of the german past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw , on the oder river , was became part of poland in 1945 back in the early 1990s , after communism had fallen and wroclaw 's history was no longer taboo , a large number of photo albums devoted to pre-war architecture were published , said the author .
this piqued his interest in the era . " i practically moved into the wroclaw university library , " he said .
" i love leafing through old books , records , historical monographs and address books .
i read old 1920s and 1930s german newspapers .
this enables me to grasp the flavor of the time . " thanks to his detailed research , krajewski knows , for example , which perfumes his main character ’ s young wife would have used , and which brand of cigarettes inspector mock would have smoked . each story about inspector mock starts out as a straight detective novel , along the lines of agatha christie or conan doyle , but then it drifts off into juicy images of stodgy silesian cuisine , drinking feasts , jewish street markets , and local theater productions . krajewski includes details from the glamorous lifestyle of breslau ’ s rich and famous as well as from the daily lives of the city ’ s lower classes - including plenty of anecdotes about historical breslau inhabitants . city of diversity and integration those who think they have picked up an airport novel end up with question marks about the nature of european identity and the overlay of cultures in a city with shifting populations .
until world war ii , breslau had been a place where german , jews , poles and other minorities lived together in relative peace and tolerance . krajewski " was certainly the first to give this nostalgia a literary shape , bringing the past back , making it more visible and showing the roots , which was not only valuable from the literary point of view , but also culturally acceptable , " said literary critic krzysztof fordonski . the way krajewski structures a literary work out of minute elements of the past is unconventional for polish literature , added fordonski .
" this gives his books credibility which transcends what we normally expect from a detective story . " although a feature film about inspector mock has yet to be shot , several tv dramatizations of the series have already been made .
there is also talk of a major polish-german film co-production that would introduce inspector mock to mainstream european audiences . " krajewski is the first to recreate this world with lots of character , so you are moved back to those times in wroclaw , " said actress edyta bach , who grew up in the city .
" i think wroclaw has some mysteries .
there are lots of places in wroclaw which are not yet discovered . " another taboo to the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books have been translated into german and other languages in his latest novel , " minotaur 's head , " krajewski sets the scene for a debate about post-war mass expulsions , a topic that remains very touchy in poland .
this time , inspector mock investigates a grisly murder case involving rape and cannibalism which takes him from breslau to what was then the eastern polish city of lvov , now known as lviv in western ukraine . breslau is the ukrainian equivalent of lvov : after the war , the germans in breslau were expelled to germany , while the poles in lvov were forced back into poland .
these post-war expulsions , marked by violence , pilfering , and death , are a painful memory that many have preferred to suppress over the past six decades . all the book ’ s characters would have been driven out of their homes .
inspector mock leaves breslau and ends up in the us , while the polish inspector he teams up with in lvov would most likely have been resettled to mock ’ s home town . critic krzysztof fordonski said that by setting his novel in the two cities on the eve of the war , krajewski provides a missing link in central european literature . " i think that by setting his latest book in lviv he broke much more of a taboo because we got used to the fact that the western territories of poland were german until 1945 , " he said .

while the star detective solves crimes , the books carefully uncover even greater mysteries about wroclaw 's german history . when crime writer marek krajewski tours poland to meet with his readers , he attracts more fans than nearly any other polish author , which may be because krajewski is not the typical thriller writer . his dark detective novels are very original and feature the feisty , fiercely independent and lecherous inspector eberhardt mock .
krajewski is also a classical scholar with a penchant for latin verse , literary allusions , and above all , a love of the pre-world war ii history of the city of breslau - now called wroclaw - in south-western poland . fascination with the past growing up in wroclaw during the cold war , krajewski was intrigued to find out more about the city whose communist rulers had done their best to erase all traces of the german past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw , on the oder river , was became part of poland in 1945 back in the early 1990s , after communism had fallen and wroclaw 's history was no longer taboo , a large number of photo albums devoted to pre-war architecture were published , said the author .
this piqued his interest in the era . " i practically moved into the wroclaw university library , " he said .
" i love leafing through old books , records , historical monographs and address books .
i read old 1920s and 1930s german newspapers .
this enables me to grasp the flavor of the time . " thanks to his detailed research , krajewski knows , for example , which perfumes his main character ’ s young wife would have used , and which brand of cigarettes inspector mock would have smoked . each story about inspector mock starts out as a straight detective novel , along the lines of agatha christie or conan doyle , but then it drifts off into juicy images of stodgy silesian cuisine , drinking feasts , jewish street markets , and local theater productions . krajewski includes details from the glamorous lifestyle of breslau ’ s rich and famous as well as from the daily lives of the city ’ s lower classes - including plenty of anecdotes about historical breslau inhabitants . city of diversity and integration those who think they have picked up an airport novel end up with question marks about the nature of european identity and the overlay of cultures in a city with shifting populations .
until world war ii , breslau had been a place where german , jews , poles and other minorities lived together in relative peace and tolerance . krajewski " was certainly the first to give this nostalgia a literary shape , bringing the past back , making it more visible and showing the roots , which was not only valuable from the literary point of view , but also culturally acceptable , " said literary critic krzysztof fordonski . the way krajewski structures a literary work out of minute elements of the past is unconventional for polish literature , added fordonski .
" this gives his books credibility which transcends what we normally expect from a detective story . " although a feature film about inspector mock has yet to be shot , several tv dramatizations of the series have already been made .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 24.08.2009 fears of regime change add new dimension to russia-ukraine tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rift between yushchenko and medvedev is set to widen as ukraine celebrates the 18th anniversary of its independence from soviet rule , the shadow of its former communist past still hangs heavy .
moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv . despite leaving the shackles of the kremlin 's influence behind following the 1991 collapse of the soviet union , ukraine has yet to find any real peace away from its former master .
the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .
these fears were heightened after medvedev submitted legislation to parliament last week that will give him powers to deploy the military abroad " to defend the interests of russia and its citizens . "
prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .

moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv . despite leaving the shackles of the kremlin 's influence behind following the 1991 collapse of the soviet union , ukraine has yet to find any real peace away from its former master .
the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .
these fears were heightened after medvedev submitted legislation to parliament last week that will give him powers to deploy the military abroad " to defend the interests of russia and its citizens . "
prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .
" there are two schools of thinking in the kremlin over ukraine .
one wants moscow to push for a pro-russia elite in kyiv , one which is open to doing business with russia , one which is loyal and reliable and which will honor and implement deals struck between the two countries .

prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .
" there are two schools of thinking in the kremlin over ukraine .
one wants moscow to push for a pro-russia elite in kyiv , one which is open to doing business with russia , one which is loyal and reliable and which will honor and implement deals struck between the two countries . " " the other school would prefer to see yushchenko stay in power as he is seen as incompetent , " he added . " this stimulates chaos and uncertainty in ukraine and makes it vulnerable to russia ’ s wishes .
this also serves the purpose of showing that post-soviet states can ’ t work without russia and that one day , they will have to come under the protection of some russia-led bloc once again . " russia unconcerned with potential european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was silent as medvedev signaled russia 's intensions any interference by russia in january 's presidential election or in its aftermath would bring moscow once again into conflict with europe and the united states .
medvedev is unlikely to lose much sleep over any eu response should the kremlin - one way or another - install its favored candidate in the kyiv hot seat .
the eu , currently hugely dependent on russian gas , imposed no serious penalty on moscow over the war with georgia and recent signs hint that russia will escape just as lightly if it succeeds in undercutting ukraine 's independence .

moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv . despite leaving the shackles of the kremlin 's influence behind following the 1991 collapse of the soviet union , ukraine has yet to find any real peace away from its former master .
the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 24.08.2009 germany 's car scrapping scheme may have backfired großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car-scrapping bonus has had unwanted side-effects the german government has decided not to renew its car scrapping scheme , citing costs .
yet there are also concerns that instead of being crushed here , many cars are being illegally shipped to africa . in an effort to stimulate consumer spending , the german government has provided a scrap bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- for two million old cars this year .
on monday , germany announced it would not extend the subsidy , which has proved extremely popular .
many germans jumped at the chance to replace old cars with new ones .
but instead of being crushed here , as planned by the program , many cars end up in africa .
the german police association bund deutscher kriminalbeamter -lrb- bdk -rrb- has been bombarded with press interview requests ever since it estimated earlier this month that since january at least 50,000 cars have been exported illegally , after their owners had been granted the scrap bonus .
for his calculation bdk vice-chairman wilfried albishausen , who spent part of his career fighting organized crime , adapted criteria which are generaly used for estimating drug trafficking .
" the risk of being caught is extremely low , as there is hardly any control , " he told deutsche welle . " when someone is caught , punishment remains minimal .
thirdly there is a market for old cars in africa and eastern europe .
and the german scrap industry is in a bad shape and therefore more willing to ignore the law . "
gottfried hoell , chairman of the association for the german scrap industry , confirms what the police inspector assumes : 80 percent of the 1,400 officially registered scrappers , hoell says , he trusts blindly .
that leaves almost 300 whom he can not trust .
hoell understands the wrongdoers : " when a car scrapper has financial problems because of the bonus - because he is getting too many cars and has to rent extra space for them and at the same time sells less spare parts for old cars because the cars are no longer there - then of course when he gets an attractive offer in such a situation , he will not say no , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars have not ended up being scrapped during a recent visit to a scrap company in central germany , hoell met an interested african on the premises , who was willing to pay up to 2,500 euros for any bonus car .
that story does n't surprise a nigerian shipping agent based in the rhineland .
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , said he exports up to 150 cars a month to west africa .
he is not involved in illegal business himself , he said .
but he hears stories of exporters taking old cars apart before packing them in containers .
once they reach their destination , they are put together again .
business as usual if two million german old cars are shredded , one would expect a lack of used cars .
german used-car dealers confirm that their business this year sank to barely 20 percent of last year 's turnover .
but in an interview with german national radio deutschlandfunk , a dealer in cotonou , west africa 's main harbour of car imports in the republic of benin , said earlier this month he had n't noticed any difference .
the nigerian shipping agent has no problems either .
" from my situation i do n't think anything changed , " he said .
" from the business i have not noticed any change . "
the man exports mainly via antwerp , where belgian custom authorities may pay little attention to the german scrap bonus scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numerous cases of illegal used-car exports have been reported but even in german harbours like hamburg and bremerhaven customs can do little more than check freight papers , said the bdk 's albishausen .
" they just do n't have the capacity to open up every single container .
but when they check , they often find something .
in hamburg alone they detected nearly 50 cases of illegal used-car exports so far this year . "
five billion euros lost if the bottom line is that the german government 's environmental bonus stimulates the export of old cars , the environment may benefit very little .

yet there are also concerns that instead of being crushed here , many cars are being illegally shipped to africa . in an effort to stimulate consumer spending , the german government has provided a scrap bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- for two million old cars this year .
on monday , germany announced it would not extend the subsidy , which has proved extremely popular .
many germans jumped at the chance to replace old cars with new ones .
but instead of being crushed here , as planned by the program , many cars end up in africa .
the german police association bund deutscher kriminalbeamter -lrb- bdk -rrb- has been bombarded with press interview requests ever since it estimated earlier this month that since january at least 50,000 cars have been exported illegally , after their owners had been granted the scrap bonus .
for his calculation bdk vice-chairman wilfried albishausen , who spent part of his career fighting organized crime , adapted criteria which are generaly used for estimating drug trafficking .
" the risk of being caught is extremely low , as there is hardly any control , " he told deutsche welle . " when someone is caught , punishment remains minimal .
thirdly there is a market for old cars in africa and eastern europe .
and the german scrap industry is in a bad shape and therefore more willing to ignore the law . "
gottfried hoell , chairman of the association for the german scrap industry , confirms what the police inspector assumes : 80 percent of the 1,400 officially registered scrappers , hoell says , he trusts blindly .
that leaves almost 300 whom he can not trust .
hoell understands the wrongdoers : " when a car scrapper has financial problems because of the bonus - because he is getting too many cars and has to rent extra space for them and at the same time sells less spare parts for old cars because the cars are no longer there - then of course when he gets an attractive offer in such a situation , he will not say no , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars have not ended up being scrapped during a recent visit to a scrap company in central germany , hoell met an interested african on the premises , who was willing to pay up to 2,500 euros for any bonus car .
that story does n't surprise a nigerian shipping agent based in the rhineland .
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , said he exports up to 150 cars a month to west africa .
he is not involved in illegal business himself , he said .
but he hears stories of exporters taking old cars apart before packing them in containers .
once they reach their destination , they are put together again .
business as usual if two million german old cars are shredded , one would expect a lack of used cars .
german used-car dealers confirm that their business this year sank to barely 20 percent of last year 's turnover .
but in an interview with german national radio deutschlandfunk , a dealer in cotonou , west africa 's main harbour of car imports in the republic of benin , said earlier this month he had n't noticed any difference .
the nigerian shipping agent has no problems either .
" from my situation i do n't think anything changed , " he said .
" from the business i have not noticed any change . "
the man exports mainly via antwerp , where belgian custom authorities may pay little attention to the german scrap bonus scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numerous cases of illegal used-car exports have been reported but even in german harbours like hamburg and bremerhaven customs can do little more than check freight papers , said the bdk 's albishausen .
" they just do n't have the capacity to open up every single container .
but when they check , they often find something .
in hamburg alone they detected nearly 50 cases of illegal used-car exports so far this year . "
five billion euros lost if the bottom line is that the german government 's environmental bonus stimulates the export of old cars , the environment may benefit very little .
" with that program five billion euros are going down the drain , " said spokeswoman ulrike fokken of the deutsche umwelthilfe , an environmental organisation in berlin .
" it is an old problem that germany dumps its garbage in africa , " she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 24.08.2009 germany 's car scrapping scheme may have backfired großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car-scrapping bonus has had unwanted side-effects the german government has decided not to renew its car scrapping scheme , citing costs .
yet there are also concerns that instead of being crushed here , many cars are being illegally shipped to africa . in an effort to stimulate consumer spending , the german government has provided a scrap bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- for two million old cars this year .
on monday , germany announced it would not extend the subsidy , which has proved extremely popular .
many germans jumped at the chance to replace old cars with new ones .
but instead of being crushed here , as planned by the program , many cars end up in africa .
the german police association bund deutscher kriminalbeamter -lrb- bdk -rrb- has been bombarded with press interview requests ever since it estimated earlier this month that since january at least 50,000 cars have been exported illegally , after their owners had been granted the scrap bonus .
for his calculation bdk vice-chairman wilfried albishausen , who spent part of his career fighting organized crime , adapted criteria which are generaly used for estimating drug trafficking .
" the risk of being caught is extremely low , as there is hardly any control , " he told deutsche welle . " when someone is caught , punishment remains minimal .
thirdly there is a market for old cars in africa and eastern europe .
and the german scrap industry is in a bad shape and therefore more willing to ignore the law . "
gottfried hoell , chairman of the association for the german scrap industry , confirms what the police inspector assumes : 80 percent of the 1,400 officially registered scrappers , hoell says , he trusts blindly .
that leaves almost 300 whom he can not trust .
hoell understands the wrongdoers : " when a car scrapper has financial problems because of the bonus - because he is getting too many cars and has to rent extra space for them and at the same time sells less spare parts for old cars because the cars are no longer there - then of course when he gets an attractive offer in such a situation , he will not say no , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars have not ended up being scrapped during a recent visit to a scrap company in central germany , hoell met an interested african on the premises , who was willing to pay up to 2,500 euros for any bonus car .
that story does n't surprise a nigerian shipping agent based in the rhineland .
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , said he exports up to 150 cars a month to west africa .
he is not involved in illegal business himself , he said .
but he hears stories of exporters taking old cars apart before packing them in containers .
once they reach their destination , they are put together again .
business as usual if two million german old cars are shredded , one would expect a lack of used cars .
german used-car dealers confirm that their business this year sank to barely 20 percent of last year 's turnover .
but in an interview with german national radio deutschlandfunk , a dealer in cotonou , west africa 's main harbour of car imports in the republic of benin , said earlier this month he had n't noticed any difference .
the nigerian shipping agent has no problems either .
" from my situation i do n't think anything changed , " he said .
" from the business i have not noticed any change . "
the man exports mainly via antwerp , where belgian custom authorities may pay little attention to the german scrap bonus scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numerous cases of illegal used-car exports have been reported but even in german harbours like hamburg and bremerhaven customs can do little more than check freight papers , said the bdk 's albishausen .
" they just do n't have the capacity to open up every single container .
but when they check , they often find something .
in hamburg alone they detected nearly 50 cases of illegal used-car exports so far this year . "
five billion euros lost if the bottom line is that the german government 's environmental bonus stimulates the export of old cars , the environment may benefit very little .
" with that program five billion euros are going down the drain , " said spokeswoman ulrike fokken of the deutsche umwelthilfe , an environmental organisation in berlin .
" it is an old problem that germany dumps its garbage in africa , " she added .
scrapper gottfried höll laughs off the environmental justification , even for those cars that are demolished in germany in line with the scheme .
before they are crushed all the parts can be removed , including the old engine , to live a second life in europe .
or elsewhere .

now , the german teenager is becoming famous for something else : her singing . petras first hit the headlines in 2006 at age 13 when she appeared in a german documentary claiming that she had been born in the wrong body .
back then , kim was a boy called tim and wanted a sex change , despite being so young . now , at age 16 , petras has completed her gender reassignment and become the world 's youngest known transsexual .
but that 's not the only reason why she 's shot to fame .
petras is also an aspiring pop singer .
with over a million hits on her myspace page , the successful release of her single “ fade away ” last year and a contract with joyce records , she 's set to become a star . it 's not just in her native germany that petras 's fan base is growing .
she 's also broken into the british market .
her debut video “ die for you ” had its premiere during her first television appearance in the uk in july . like other successful artists these days , petras got her start by posting demos on the internet .
" i actually posted a few videos of me singing cover songs or my own songs on youtube and they got so many clicks that a german producer discovered me and that 's how i got into music , " she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petras hopes to break into the uk market with her new album the music kim is producing now is a far cry from the videos she made of herself singing cover songs of artists such as alicia keys in 2007 .
now she writes , performs and co-produces all of her own music , using her past as an inspiration for the lyrics she writes . " i get my inspiration for my songs and the lyrics from experiences in my life but i 'm also very inspired by the beatles and cyndi lauper as i really like their music , " she says . fighting for her right to surgery the music business is notoriously tough to break into , but petras is used to uphill battles .
as a preteen , she began campaigning for her right to have gender reassignment surgery , despite the fact that the legal age limit for the surgery in germany was 18 .
" i went to many psychologists , and many of them agreed that it would be really important for me to have the surgery as soon as possible and not wait until i was 18 .
and because i had so many psychologists on my side , i got the legal permission i needed , " petras says .
she also campaigned on german television in an attempt to raise awareness about her situation .
she says she 's convinced that legislators should listen to psychologists when it comes to making decisions of this kind . psychologist bernhard breuer says the wellbeing of the child or adolescent is the main priority in such cases .
it 's not always reasonable to expect the patient to wait until he or she is 18 , he says .
with adequate assessment and treatment prior to surgery , breuer says the chances of the child regretting the decision are small .
" in germany we have gender teams , in which child psychiatrists work together with child endocrinologists and child psychotherapists and if they all come to the conclusion that it would be best to provide the child with appropriate treatment , then everything has been done from a diagnostic point of view to ensure that the child will not be given the wrong treatment , " breuer says .
" i finally feel like myself " kim petras has no regrets about her surgery and is adamant that it has n't really changed her life because she always lived her life as a girl : she dressed as a girl , played with girls ' toys and grew her hair long , refusing to have it cut like a boy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petras says she has always lived her life as a girl " i do n't think anything has changed because of the surgery , " she says .
" i just feel really self-confident now , much more than before because i finally feel like myself . "
psychologist breuer adds that the dangers of sex change surgery are general rather than age-specific .
in some cases , he says , it can be better to perform the surgery earlier rather than later .
" it is actually relatively advantageous when transgender people are not operated on too late because a younger body overcomes such operations much more quickly and easily and a younger person can cope with it more easily , " says breuer .
kim says that she 's only had positive reactions so far to her sex change .
both her family and her friends have always supported her and accepted her as a girl .
because she started hormone therapy at age 12 , her voice never broke .
she says people listening to her music have no idea about her past .
" in the music business , everybody was really impressed because i do n't have a low voice .
so far , i 've only had positive feedback and most people are really happy for me that i did it at 16 , " she says .
currently , kim is focusing on her music career and looking forward to recording and releasing her album .
but she has other plans for her life .
" i 'm in the eleventh grade so i 'm doing my a-level in two years and then i want to study fashion .
i really admire vivienne westwood , because she 's always done her thing and she 's eccentric but really great at the same time .
maybe later i could become a designer as well , " she says .
with the successful launch of her music career and the extensive media attention that she 's attracted so far , kim has a good chance of making it in the world of fashion , too .

it 's not always reasonable to expect the patient to wait until he or she is 18 , he says .
with adequate assessment and treatment prior to surgery , breuer says the chances of the child regretting the decision are small .
" in germany we have gender teams , in which child psychiatrists work together with child endocrinologists and child psychotherapists and if they all come to the conclusion that it would be best to provide the child with appropriate treatment , then everything has been done from a diagnostic point of view to ensure that the child will not be given the wrong treatment , " breuer says .
" i finally feel like myself " kim petras has no regrets about her surgery and is adamant that it has n't really changed her life because she always lived her life as a girl : she dressed as a girl , played with girls ' toys and grew her hair long , refusing to have it cut like a boy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petras says she has always lived her life as a girl " i do n't think anything has changed because of the surgery , " she says .
" i just feel really self-confident now , much more than before because i finally feel like myself . "
psychologist breuer adds that the dangers of sex change surgery are general rather than age-specific .
in some cases , he says , it can be better to perform the surgery earlier rather than later .
" it is actually relatively advantageous when transgender people are not operated on too late because a younger body overcomes such operations much more quickly and easily and a younger person can cope with it more easily , " says breuer .
kim says that she 's only had positive reactions so far to her sex change .
both her family and her friends have always supported her and accepted her as a girl .
because she started hormone therapy at age 12 , her voice never broke .
she says people listening to her music have no idea about her past .
" in the music business , everybody was really impressed because i do n't have a low voice .
so far , i 've only had positive feedback and most people are really happy for me that i did it at 16 , " she says .
currently , kim is focusing on her music career and looking forward to recording and releasing her album .
but she has other plans for her life .
" i 'm in the eleventh grade so i 'm doing my a-level in two years and then i want to study fashion .
i really admire vivienne westwood , because she 's always done her thing and she 's eccentric but really great at the same time .
maybe later i could become a designer as well , " she says .
with the successful launch of her music career and the extensive media attention that she 's attracted so far , kim has a good chance of making it in the world of fashion , too .

but that has n't necessarily boosted the spd ’ s credibility . germany 's oldest political party , the spd , set out in 1875 to become an advocate of the working class and all underprivileged people in society .
although the party officially rebranded itself as a " party of the people " – and not just the working class – in 1959 , it 's still widely associated with being a defender of social justice and equality .
in postwar germany , the spd was also for a long time the largest party , ruling the country between 1969 and 1982 and then again between 1998 and 2005 .
but since 2005 , it has been stuck in a reluctant grand coalition with the conservatives , and that has seen the party ’ s membership and popularity ratings enter a free fall .
current opinion polls see the social democrats trailing the conservative cdu by a wide margin .
in a desperate race to regain lost ground ahead of the general election , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , surprised the media with a headline-grabbing promise incorporated in the party ’ s manifesto .
he announced that the social democrats would create four million new jobs over the next decade , which – if seen against current jobless levels – would mean that the country could boast full employment 10 years from now .
fiscal and environmental policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd hopeful frank-walter steinmeier mingling with coal miners in germany in a bid to lure away voters both from the green and far-left spectrum of the political landscape , the spd in its " plan for germany " says its program to foster energy-saving and environmentally-friendly industries could employ two million people .
another million would be needed in the health system and especially geriatric care as the population ages dramatically .
the remaining one million jobs would emerge in the service and trade sector .
the party has faced massive criticism from other political players who insist that creating four million new jobs is totally unrealistic .
in terms of energy policy , the spd wants to reduce the country 's dependence on oil and get half of its power from renewable sources by 2030 .
its position on nuclear energy remains unchanged .
the social democrats stick to what they agreed while governing with the green party – the complete phase-out of nuclear power , meaning the decommissioning of all remaining nuclear power stations in the country by 2020 .
referring to the current economic crisis and the mounting public debt burden , germany 's spd is categorically opposed to any major tax cuts in the next legislature .
it actually plans to raise the top rate of taxation for big earners to 47 percent from 45 percent of incomes at present .
on the other hand , it promises an income tax bonus of 300 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- for people who do not file a claim for rebates .
this is not a nice social gesture , but rather an attempt to cut red tape .
defender of social justice the spd is hoping to appeal to families by offering to raise the tax break for each child per household by 200 euros .
the party has also presented itself as a passionate fighter for a minimum wage of 7.50 euros per hour across all sectors of the economy .

but that has n't necessarily boosted the spd ’ s credibility . germany 's oldest political party , the spd , set out in 1875 to become an advocate of the working class and all underprivileged people in society .
although the party officially rebranded itself as a " party of the people " – and not just the working class – in 1959 , it 's still widely associated with being a defender of social justice and equality .
in postwar germany , the spd was also for a long time the largest party , ruling the country between 1969 and 1982 and then again between 1998 and 2005 .
but since 2005 , it has been stuck in a reluctant grand coalition with the conservatives , and that has seen the party ’ s membership and popularity ratings enter a free fall .
current opinion polls see the social democrats trailing the conservative cdu by a wide margin .
in a desperate race to regain lost ground ahead of the general election , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , surprised the media with a headline-grabbing promise incorporated in the party ’ s manifesto .
he announced that the social democrats would create four million new jobs over the next decade , which – if seen against current jobless levels – would mean that the country could boast full employment 10 years from now .
fiscal and environmental policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd hopeful frank-walter steinmeier mingling with coal miners in germany in a bid to lure away voters both from the green and far-left spectrum of the political landscape , the spd in its " plan for germany " says its program to foster energy-saving and environmentally-friendly industries could employ two million people .
another million would be needed in the health system and especially geriatric care as the population ages dramatically .
the remaining one million jobs would emerge in the service and trade sector .
the party has faced massive criticism from other political players who insist that creating four million new jobs is totally unrealistic .
in terms of energy policy , the spd wants to reduce the country 's dependence on oil and get half of its power from renewable sources by 2030 .
its position on nuclear energy remains unchanged .
the social democrats stick to what they agreed while governing with the green party – the complete phase-out of nuclear power , meaning the decommissioning of all remaining nuclear power stations in the country by 2020 .
referring to the current economic crisis and the mounting public debt burden , germany 's spd is categorically opposed to any major tax cuts in the next legislature .
it actually plans to raise the top rate of taxation for big earners to 47 percent from 45 percent of incomes at present .
on the other hand , it promises an income tax bonus of 300 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- for people who do not file a claim for rebates .
this is not a nice social gesture , but rather an attempt to cut red tape .
defender of social justice the spd is hoping to appeal to families by offering to raise the tax break for each child per household by 200 euros .
the party has also presented itself as a passionate fighter for a minimum wage of 7.50 euros per hour across all sectors of the economy .

the spd also repeats its demand that first degrees at universities and colleges should not be subject to study fees which are currently in place in a number of cdu-governed german states .
foreign policy on the foreign policy front , the spd likes to portray itself as a party that banks on diplomacy rather than military intervention .

now , the german teenager is becoming famous for something else : her singing . petras first hit the headlines in 2006 at age 13 when she appeared in a german documentary claiming that she had been born in the wrong body .
back then , kim was a boy called tim and wanted a sex change , despite being so young . now , at age 16 , petras has completed her gender reassignment and become the world 's youngest known transsexual .
but that 's not the only reason why she 's shot to fame .
petras is also an aspiring pop singer .
with over a million hits on her myspace page , the successful release of her single “ fade away ” last year and a contract with joyce records , she 's set to become a star . it 's not just in her native germany that petras 's fan base is growing .
she 's also broken into the british market .
her debut video “ die for you ” had its premiere during her first television appearance in the uk in july . like other successful artists these days , petras got her start by posting demos on the internet .
" i actually posted a few videos of me singing cover songs or my own songs on youtube and they got so many clicks that a german producer discovered me and that 's how i got into music , " she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petras hopes to break into the uk market with her new album the music kim is producing now is a far cry from the videos she made of herself singing cover songs of artists such as alicia keys in 2007 .
now she writes , performs and co-produces all of her own music , using her past as an inspiration for the lyrics she writes . " i get my inspiration for my songs and the lyrics from experiences in my life but i 'm also very inspired by the beatles and cyndi lauper as i really like their music , " she says . fighting for her right to surgery the music business is notoriously tough to break into , but petras is used to uphill battles .
as a preteen , she began campaigning for her right to have gender reassignment surgery , despite the fact that the legal age limit for the surgery in germany was 18 .
" i went to many psychologists , and many of them agreed that it would be really important for me to have the surgery as soon as possible and not wait until i was 18 .
and because i had so many psychologists on my side , i got the legal permission i needed , " petras says .
she also campaigned on german television in an attempt to raise awareness about her situation .
she says she 's convinced that legislators should listen to psychologists when it comes to making decisions of this kind . psychologist bernhard breuer says the wellbeing of the child or adolescent is the main priority in such cases .
it 's not always reasonable to expect the patient to wait until he or she is 18 , he says .
with adequate assessment and treatment prior to surgery , breuer says the chances of the child regretting the decision are small .
" in germany we have gender teams , in which child psychiatrists work together with child endocrinologists and child psychotherapists and if they all come to the conclusion that it would be best to provide the child with appropriate treatment , then everything has been done from a diagnostic point of view to ensure that the child will not be given the wrong treatment , " breuer says .
" i finally feel like myself " kim petras has no regrets about her surgery and is adamant that it has n't really changed her life because she always lived her life as a girl : she dressed as a girl , played with girls ' toys and grew her hair long , refusing to have it cut like a boy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petras says she has always lived her life as a girl " i do n't think anything has changed because of the surgery , " she says .
" i just feel really self-confident now , much more than before because i finally feel like myself . "
psychologist breuer adds that the dangers of sex change surgery are general rather than age-specific .
in some cases , he says , it can be better to perform the surgery earlier rather than later .
" it is actually relatively advantageous when transgender people are not operated on too late because a younger body overcomes such operations much more quickly and easily and a younger person can cope with it more easily , " says breuer .
kim says that she 's only had positive reactions so far to her sex change .
both her family and her friends have always supported her and accepted her as a girl .
because she started hormone therapy at age 12 , her voice never broke .
she says people listening to her music have no idea about her past .
" in the music business , everybody was really impressed because i do n't have a low voice .
so far , i 've only had positive feedback and most people are really happy for me that i did it at 16 , " she says .
currently , kim is focusing on her music career and looking forward to recording and releasing her album .
but she has other plans for her life .
" i 'm in the eleventh grade so i 'm doing my a-level in two years and then i want to study fashion .
i really admire vivienne westwood , because she 's always done her thing and she 's eccentric but really great at the same time .
maybe later i could become a designer as well , " she says .
with the successful launch of her music career and the extensive media attention that she 's attracted so far , kim has a good chance of making it in the world of fashion , too .

now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .
they are determined to scrap germany 's compulsory military service -lrb- germany is one of the few remaining nato countries with a conscripted army -rrb- , and to reduce the size of the army generally .
they also want to seize the initiative of us president barack obama 's election to push for better relations with iran and north korea .
the green party is also the german party with the most faith in the european union and would like to see the eu 's profile raised in the world . author : ben knight editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .
they are determined to scrap germany 's compulsory military service -lrb- germany is one of the few remaining nato countries with a conscripted army -rrb- , and to reduce the size of the army generally .
they also want to seize the initiative of us president barack obama 's election to push for better relations with iran and north korea .
the green party is also the german party with the most faith in the european union and would like to see the eu 's profile raised in the world . author : ben knight editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if recent state level success continues , the left party will become difficult to ignore . a glance at the left party 's website shows where its priorities and its ambitions lie .
" the left party is entering these elections aspiring to take part in the formation of governments , and it is prepared to lead these governments , " the homepage reads .
though it was founded in 2005 under the name electoral alternative for labor and social justice , the left party has apparently shed its oppositional position and is beginning to feel strong enough to test its socialist agenda in government . despite ostensible successes at a regional level and a clear national profile in the media , the left party is still regarded as political poison by its rivals in the west of the country – any hint that a politician might harbor fantasies of a coalition with the left generally ignites a round of indignation .
the left 's position as the direct successors of the party of democratic socialism and by extension the ruling party of former east germany , the sed , is still a stigma . problematic past part of this reputation is down to the controversial past of gregor gysi , co-chairman of the left 's parliamentary group .
a member of the sed since 1967 , gysi rose to prominence around the time of germany 's reunification , playing an instrumental part in the internal re-organization of the sed and its reinvention as the pds , of which he became the first party chairman .
his charisma and rhetorical gift made him an important leader of the left party , but his record has been stained recently by accusations that he was an informant for the east german secret police , the stasi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi has been both a popular and shadowy element in the left 's leadership after steadily improving election results throughout the 1990s , the pds / left party managed to enter coalition governments , or support spd-led minority governments , in a few states in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
much of its success in the west depends on oskar lafontaine , the high-profile spd defector whose pugnacious media presence has given the party its recent national profile . social and economic policy lafontaine 's statements , such as " we want to overthrow capitalism , " in an interview with der spiegel in may 2009 , frequently give the impression that the party deliberately fosters this provocative anti-establishment image .
but its policies , though radical , are not anti-democratic . central to its economic policy is a keynesian use of state intervention to balance market forces .
in the current election program , this includes socializing the entire banking system , outlawing non-transparent financial products , hedge funds , and venture capitalism , and restricting currency markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reversing schroeder 's social welfare reforms has been a unifying cause in the left party on a social level , the left 's economic plan would mean the introduction of a minimum hourly wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14.30 -rrb- , raising top-rate income tax from 42 percent to 53 percent , and scrapping the hartz iv unemployment benefit reforms introduced under gerhard schroeder 's government .
as a stop-gap during this transition , the left would raise long-term unemployment benefit , currently at 345 euros a month , to 500 euros , raise child benefit to 200 euros a month , and introduce a minimum pension of 800 euros . there would be a similar spending spree in education .
the left would not only ditch university tuition fees , but would redirect a full 7 percent of germany 's gross domestic product into education .

now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany 's top candidates angela merkel : from shy physicist to re-elected stateswoman guido westerwelle : resurrecting germany 's liberals frank-walter steinmeier : uphill battle for the chancellery oskar lafontaine : populist rebel of the left politics -pipe- 24.08.2009 the green party : getting used to opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens promise a way out of the financial and climate crises having spent seven years in government with the social democratic party , the greens had to use the last legislature creating a meaningful opposition to its former partner .
now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .
they are determined to scrap germany 's compulsory military service -lrb- germany is one of the few remaining nato countries with a conscripted army -rrb- , and to reduce the size of the army generally .
they also want to seize the initiative of us president barack obama 's election to push for better relations with iran and north korea .
the green party is also the german party with the most faith in the european union and would like to see the eu 's profile raised in the world . author : ben knight editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as its name suggests , the cdu is christian-based but aims to appeal to broad cross-section of society .
anyone may join the party , which has pursued a neo-liberal since helmut kohl 's time as germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 .
the party 's 2009 election slogan , " we have the strength , " is an attempt to position chancellor angela merkel as the only politician able to drag germany out of the economic crisis .
" we have the power to make germany stronger than it was before the crisis , " merkel said when presenting her election program to the public in june .
fiscal policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's conservatives want to cut taxes to overcome economic crisis germany 's two conservative parties strongly reject tax increases to finance current measures to stabilize financial markets and stimulate economic growth .
instead they aim to boost domestic consumption with a two-step cut in the lowest income tax bracket , from 14 to 12 percent .
they also want to raise the threshold above which income is taxed at the highest rate of 42 percent to 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,600 -rrb- from 52,552 euros .
the cdu / csu call for reforms to limit the impact of " cold progression " - the process by which taxpayers are shifted into higher tax brackets thus reducing their real income after a pay raise .
the conservatives also say they will examine corporate taxes to ensure they do not over-burden firms .
however , the envisaged tax measures are dependent on the next government 's financial room to maneuver .
in labor market policy , the two conservative parties are strictly against the introduction of a nationwide minimum wage , arguing that wage policy must remain an issue of collective bargaining between labor and business .
reforming international financial markets merkel 's conservatives blame lax oversight on the part of banks and international financial markets for the current financial crisis .
they say the european union 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro , must be strengthened , and they reject attempts to exert political influence over the european central bank .
they also press for stronger supervision of the banking sector , including an international code of conduct for hedge funds and ratings agencies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 24.08.2009 world 's youngest transsexual poised for pop stardom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim petras kim petras became the world 's youngest known transsexual when she completed gender reassignment surgery last november at age 16 .
now , the german teenager is becoming famous for something else : her singing . petras first hit the headlines in 2006 at age 13 when she appeared in a german documentary claiming that she had been born in the wrong body .
back then , kim was a boy called tim and wanted a sex change , despite being so young . now , at age 16 , petras has completed her gender reassignment and become the world 's youngest known transsexual .
but that 's not the only reason why she 's shot to fame .
petras is also an aspiring pop singer .
with over a million hits on her myspace page , the successful release of her single “ fade away ” last year and a contract with joyce records , she 's set to become a star . it 's not just in her native germany that petras 's fan base is growing .
she 's also broken into the british market .
her debut video “ die for you ” had its premiere during her first television appearance in the uk in july . like other successful artists these days , petras got her start by posting demos on the internet .
" i actually posted a few videos of me singing cover songs or my own songs on youtube and they got so many clicks that a german producer discovered me and that 's how i got into music , " she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petras hopes to break into the uk market with her new album the music kim is producing now is a far cry from the videos she made of herself singing cover songs of artists such as alicia keys in 2007 .
now she writes , performs and co-produces all of her own music , using her past as an inspiration for the lyrics she writes . " i get my inspiration for my songs and the lyrics from experiences in my life but i 'm also very inspired by the beatles and cyndi lauper as i really like their music , " she says . fighting for her right to surgery the music business is notoriously tough to break into , but petras is used to uphill battles .
as a preteen , she began campaigning for her right to have gender reassignment surgery , despite the fact that the legal age limit for the surgery in germany was 18 .
" i went to many psychologists , and many of them agreed that it would be really important for me to have the surgery as soon as possible and not wait until i was 18 .
and because i had so many psychologists on my side , i got the legal permission i needed , " petras says .
she also campaigned on german television in an attempt to raise awareness about her situation .
she says she 's convinced that legislators should listen to psychologists when it comes to making decisions of this kind . psychologist bernhard breuer says the wellbeing of the child or adolescent is the main priority in such cases .
it 's not always reasonable to expect the patient to wait until he or she is 18 , he says .
with adequate assessment and treatment prior to surgery , breuer says the chances of the child regretting the decision are small .
" in germany we have gender teams , in which child psychiatrists work together with child endocrinologists and child psychotherapists and if they all come to the conclusion that it would be best to provide the child with appropriate treatment , then everything has been done from a diagnostic point of view to ensure that the child will not be given the wrong treatment , " breuer says .
" i finally feel like myself " kim petras has no regrets about her surgery and is adamant that it has n't really changed her life because she always lived her life as a girl : she dressed as a girl , played with girls ' toys and grew her hair long , refusing to have it cut like a boy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petras says she has always lived her life as a girl " i do n't think anything has changed because of the surgery , " she says .
" i just feel really self-confident now , much more than before because i finally feel like myself . "
psychologist breuer adds that the dangers of sex change surgery are general rather than age-specific .
in some cases , he says , it can be better to perform the surgery earlier rather than later .
" it is actually relatively advantageous when transgender people are not operated on too late because a younger body overcomes such operations much more quickly and easily and a younger person can cope with it more easily , " says breuer .
kim says that she 's only had positive reactions so far to her sex change .
both her family and her friends have always supported her and accepted her as a girl .
because she started hormone therapy at age 12 , her voice never broke .
she says people listening to her music have no idea about her past .
" in the music business , everybody was really impressed because i do n't have a low voice .
so far , i 've only had positive feedback and most people are really happy for me that i did it at 16 , " she says .
currently , kim is focusing on her music career and looking forward to recording and releasing her album .
but she has other plans for her life .
" i 'm in the eleventh grade so i 'm doing my a-level in two years and then i want to study fashion .
i really admire vivienne westwood , because she 's always done her thing and she 's eccentric but really great at the same time .
maybe later i could become a designer as well , " she says .
with the successful launch of her music career and the extensive media attention that she 's attracted so far , kim has a good chance of making it in the world of fashion , too .

authorities have given evacuation orders , but some residents are still refusing to leave their homes . more than 2,000 firefighters , soldiers and volunteers were out in force on monday to combat the flames of six major fires that were still threatening the heavily populated northern coastal towns of nea makri , dionysos and nearby marathon as well as the islands of evia and skyros .
officials said 17 water-dropping planes and helicopters resumed operations at first light on monday , while aircraft from france , italy and cyprus were due to join in the effort .
" there are fewer fronts but the blaze is still developing , " the fire brigade chief , giannis kappakis , said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france , italy and cyprus are assisting with aircraft the firefighting efforts have been difficult with gale force winds sweeping across the country .
although the winds died down a bit on sunday night , they were expected to pick up again on monday .
the fires have destroyed several homes and about 40,000 acres of forest and olive groves , but there were no reports of deaths or serious injuries .
entire towns have been evacuated with residents seen fleeing in cars , by motorcycle or on foot .
however , not all followed the evacuation order by authorities .
desperate residents take on the flames many athenians were determined to protect their property from the flames , taking up position outside their homes with water hoses and branches .
others , armed with shovels and buckets , assisted firefighters and soldiers in their efforts to stop the blaze from spreading any further .

" the fire is 500 metres away and we 're choked in smoke , " a woman from dioni told mega channel .
" please do something , we need a helicopter to drop water , " she said .
it is unclear what caused the outbreak of forest fires which have become more frequent in recent years with rising temperatures and drought .
however , arson has also played a role in the past , allegedly often by developers .
the fires broke out late on friday just north of marathon and quickly spread over mount penteli , fanned by the winds to an area more than 40 kilometers wide .
a state of emergency was declared in greater athens almost immediately .
however , critics said the poor handling of the fires by the conservative government resembled those which hit greece in 2007 , killing more than 80 people. nk / afp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 24.08.2009 germany 's car scrapping scheme may have backfired großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car-scrapping bonus has had unwanted side-effects the german government has decided not to renew its car scrapping scheme , citing costs .
yet there are also concerns that instead of being crushed here , many cars are being illegally shipped to africa . in an effort to stimulate consumer spending , the german government has provided a scrap bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- for two million old cars this year .
on monday , germany announced it would not extend the subsidy , which has proved extremely popular .
many germans jumped at the chance to replace old cars with new ones .
but instead of being crushed here , as planned by the program , many cars end up in africa .
the german police association bund deutscher kriminalbeamter -lrb- bdk -rrb- has been bombarded with press interview requests ever since it estimated earlier this month that since january at least 50,000 cars have been exported illegally , after their owners had been granted the scrap bonus .
for his calculation bdk vice-chairman wilfried albishausen , who spent part of his career fighting organized crime , adapted criteria which are generaly used for estimating drug trafficking .
" the risk of being caught is extremely low , as there is hardly any control , " he told deutsche welle . " when someone is caught , punishment remains minimal .
thirdly there is a market for old cars in africa and eastern europe .
and the german scrap industry is in a bad shape and therefore more willing to ignore the law . "
gottfried hoell , chairman of the association for the german scrap industry , confirms what the police inspector assumes : 80 percent of the 1,400 officially registered scrappers , hoell says , he trusts blindly .
that leaves almost 300 whom he can not trust .
hoell understands the wrongdoers : " when a car scrapper has financial problems because of the bonus - because he is getting too many cars and has to rent extra space for them and at the same time sells less spare parts for old cars because the cars are no longer there - then of course when he gets an attractive offer in such a situation , he will not say no , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars have not ended up being scrapped during a recent visit to a scrap company in central germany , hoell met an interested african on the premises , who was willing to pay up to 2,500 euros for any bonus car .
that story does n't surprise a nigerian shipping agent based in the rhineland .
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , said he exports up to 150 cars a month to west africa .
he is not involved in illegal business himself , he said .
but he hears stories of exporters taking old cars apart before packing them in containers .
once they reach their destination , they are put together again .
business as usual if two million german old cars are shredded , one would expect a lack of used cars .
german used-car dealers confirm that their business this year sank to barely 20 percent of last year 's turnover .
but in an interview with german national radio deutschlandfunk , a dealer in cotonou , west africa 's main harbour of car imports in the republic of benin , said earlier this month he had n't noticed any difference .
the nigerian shipping agent has no problems either .
" from my situation i do n't think anything changed , " he said .
" from the business i have not noticed any change . "
the man exports mainly via antwerp , where belgian custom authorities may pay little attention to the german scrap bonus scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numerous cases of illegal used-car exports have been reported but even in german harbours like hamburg and bremerhaven customs can do little more than check freight papers , said the bdk 's albishausen .
" they just do n't have the capacity to open up every single container .
but when they check , they often find something .
in hamburg alone they detected nearly 50 cases of illegal used-car exports so far this year . "
five billion euros lost if the bottom line is that the german government 's environmental bonus stimulates the export of old cars , the environment may benefit very little .
" with that program five billion euros are going down the drain , " said spokeswoman ulrike fokken of the deutsche umwelthilfe , an environmental organisation in berlin .
" it is an old problem that germany dumps its garbage in africa , " she added .
scrapper gottfried höll laughs off the environmental justification , even for those cars that are demolished in germany in line with the scheme .
before they are crushed all the parts can be removed , including the old engine , to live a second life in europe .
or elsewhere .

on monday , germany announced it would not extend the subsidy , which has proved extremely popular .
many germans jumped at the chance to replace old cars with new ones .
but instead of being crushed here , as planned by the program , many cars end up in africa .
the german police association bund deutscher kriminalbeamter -lrb- bdk -rrb- has been bombarded with press interview requests ever since it estimated earlier this month that since january at least 50,000 cars have been exported illegally , after their owners had been granted the scrap bonus .
for his calculation bdk vice-chairman wilfried albishausen , who spent part of his career fighting organized crime , adapted criteria which are generaly used for estimating drug trafficking .
" the risk of being caught is extremely low , as there is hardly any control , " he told deutsche welle . " when someone is caught , punishment remains minimal .
thirdly there is a market for old cars in africa and eastern europe .
and the german scrap industry is in a bad shape and therefore more willing to ignore the law . "
gottfried hoell , chairman of the association for the german scrap industry , confirms what the police inspector assumes : 80 percent of the 1,400 officially registered scrappers , hoell says , he trusts blindly .
that leaves almost 300 whom he can not trust .
hoell understands the wrongdoers : " when a car scrapper has financial problems because of the bonus - because he is getting too many cars and has to rent extra space for them and at the same time sells less spare parts for old cars because the cars are no longer there - then of course when he gets an attractive offer in such a situation , he will not say no , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars have not ended up being scrapped during a recent visit to a scrap company in central germany , hoell met an interested african on the premises , who was willing to pay up to 2,500 euros for any bonus car .
that story does n't surprise a nigerian shipping agent based in the rhineland .
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , said he exports up to 150 cars a month to west africa .
he is not involved in illegal business himself , he said .
but he hears stories of exporters taking old cars apart before packing them in containers .
once they reach their destination , they are put together again .
business as usual if two million german old cars are shredded , one would expect a lack of used cars .
german used-car dealers confirm that their business this year sank to barely 20 percent of last year 's turnover .
but in an interview with german national radio deutschlandfunk , a dealer in cotonou , west africa 's main harbour of car imports in the republic of benin , said earlier this month he had n't noticed any difference .
the nigerian shipping agent has no problems either .
" from my situation i do n't think anything changed , " he said .
" from the business i have not noticed any change . "
the man exports mainly via antwerp , where belgian custom authorities may pay little attention to the german scrap bonus scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numerous cases of illegal used-car exports have been reported but even in german harbours like hamburg and bremerhaven customs can do little more than check freight papers , said the bdk 's albishausen .
" they just do n't have the capacity to open up every single container .
but when they check , they often find something .
in hamburg alone they detected nearly 50 cases of illegal used-car exports so far this year . "
five billion euros lost if the bottom line is that the german government 's environmental bonus stimulates the export of old cars , the environment may benefit very little .
" with that program five billion euros are going down the drain , " said spokeswoman ulrike fokken of the deutsche umwelthilfe , an environmental organisation in berlin .
" it is an old problem that germany dumps its garbage in africa , " she added .
scrapper gottfried höll laughs off the environmental justification , even for those cars that are demolished in germany in line with the scheme .
before they are crushed all the parts can be removed , including the old engine , to live a second life in europe .
or elsewhere .

hoell understands the wrongdoers : " when a car scrapper has financial problems because of the bonus - because he is getting too many cars and has to rent extra space for them and at the same time sells less spare parts for old cars because the cars are no longer there - then of course when he gets an attractive offer in such a situation , he will not say no , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars have not ended up being scrapped during a recent visit to a scrap company in central germany , hoell met an interested african on the premises , who was willing to pay up to 2,500 euros for any bonus car .
that story does n't surprise a nigerian shipping agent based in the rhineland .
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , said he exports up to 150 cars a month to west africa .
he is not involved in illegal business himself , he said .
but he hears stories of exporters taking old cars apart before packing them in containers .
once they reach their destination , they are put together again .
business as usual if two million german old cars are shredded , one would expect a lack of used cars .
german used-car dealers confirm that their business this year sank to barely 20 percent of last year 's turnover .
but in an interview with german national radio deutschlandfunk , a dealer in cotonou , west africa 's main harbour of car imports in the republic of benin , said earlier this month he had n't noticed any difference .
the nigerian shipping agent has no problems either .
" from my situation i do n't think anything changed , " he said .
" from the business i have not noticed any change . "
the man exports mainly via antwerp , where belgian custom authorities may pay little attention to the german scrap bonus scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numerous cases of illegal used-car exports have been reported but even in german harbours like hamburg and bremerhaven customs can do little more than check freight papers , said the bdk 's albishausen .
" they just do n't have the capacity to open up every single container .
but when they check , they often find something .
in hamburg alone they detected nearly 50 cases of illegal used-car exports so far this year . "
five billion euros lost if the bottom line is that the german government 's environmental bonus stimulates the export of old cars , the environment may benefit very little .
" with that program five billion euros are going down the drain , " said spokeswoman ulrike fokken of the deutsche umwelthilfe , an environmental organisation in berlin .
" it is an old problem that germany dumps its garbage in africa , " she added .
scrapper gottfried höll laughs off the environmental justification , even for those cars that are demolished in germany in line with the scheme .
before they are crushed all the parts can be removed , including the old engine , to live a second life in europe .

yet there are also concerns that instead of being crushed here , many cars are being illegally shipped to africa . in an effort to stimulate consumer spending , the german government has provided a scrap bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- for two million old cars this year .
on monday , germany announced it would not extend the subsidy , which has proved extremely popular .
many germans jumped at the chance to replace old cars with new ones .
but instead of being crushed here , as planned by the program , many cars end up in africa .
the german police association bund deutscher kriminalbeamter -lrb- bdk -rrb- has been bombarded with press interview requests ever since it estimated earlier this month that since january at least 50,000 cars have been exported illegally , after their owners had been granted the scrap bonus .
for his calculation bdk vice-chairman wilfried albishausen , who spent part of his career fighting organized crime , adapted criteria which are generaly used for estimating drug trafficking .
" the risk of being caught is extremely low , as there is hardly any control , " he told deutsche welle . " when someone is caught , punishment remains minimal .
thirdly there is a market for old cars in africa and eastern europe .
and the german scrap industry is in a bad shape and therefore more willing to ignore the law . "
gottfried hoell , chairman of the association for the german scrap industry , confirms what the police inspector assumes : 80 percent of the 1,400 officially registered scrappers , hoell says , he trusts blindly .
that leaves almost 300 whom he can not trust .

moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv . despite leaving the shackles of the kremlin 's influence behind following the 1991 collapse of the soviet union , ukraine has yet to find any real peace away from its former master .
the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .
these fears were heightened after medvedev submitted legislation to parliament last week that will give him powers to deploy the military abroad " to defend the interests of russia and its citizens . "
prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .
" there are two schools of thinking in the kremlin over ukraine .
one wants moscow to push for a pro-russia elite in kyiv , one which is open to doing business with russia , one which is loyal and reliable and which will honor and implement deals struck between the two countries . " " the other school would prefer to see yushchenko stay in power as he is seen as incompetent , " he added . " this stimulates chaos and uncertainty in ukraine and makes it vulnerable to russia ’ s wishes .
this also serves the purpose of showing that post-soviet states can ’ t work without russia and that one day , they will have to come under the protection of some russia-led bloc once again . " russia unconcerned with potential european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was silent as medvedev signaled russia 's intensions any interference by russia in january 's presidential election or in its aftermath would bring moscow once again into conflict with europe and the united states .
medvedev is unlikely to lose much sleep over any eu response should the kremlin - one way or another - install its favored candidate in the kyiv hot seat .
the eu , currently hugely dependent on russian gas , imposed no serious penalty on moscow over the war with georgia and recent signs hint that russia will escape just as lightly if it succeeds in undercutting ukraine 's independence .
at their recent meeting chancellor merkel , standing beside medvedev when he so publicly severed ties with ukraine in sochi , remained silent on the issue .
merkel , the head of the eu 's largest country , offered no support for ukraine as a democratic partner , nor defended the right of its people to choose their leaders for themselves , stunning ukrainian officials with her reticence while presumably prompting quiet satisfaction in moscow .
" we are unlikely to see any public challenge to russia from the eu should moscow interfere in ukraine , " said nicu popescu .
" the eu avoids high politics when it can and works below the radar on technical and trade levels ; providing credit , creating stability and promoting reforms .
the eu will keep out of this election whatever happens and certainly wo n't favor any one candidate over another .

moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv . despite leaving the shackles of the kremlin 's influence behind following the 1991 collapse of the soviet union , ukraine has yet to find any real peace away from its former master .
the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .
these fears were heightened after medvedev submitted legislation to parliament last week that will give him powers to deploy the military abroad " to defend the interests of russia and its citizens . "
prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .
" there are two schools of thinking in the kremlin over ukraine .
one wants moscow to push for a pro-russia elite in kyiv , one which is open to doing business with russia , one which is loyal and reliable and which will honor and implement deals struck between the two countries . " " the other school would prefer to see yushchenko stay in power as he is seen as incompetent , " he added . " this stimulates chaos and uncertainty in ukraine and makes it vulnerable to russia ’ s wishes .
this also serves the purpose of showing that post-soviet states can ’ t work without russia and that one day , they will have to come under the protection of some russia-led bloc once again . " russia unconcerned with potential european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was silent as medvedev signaled russia 's intensions any interference by russia in january 's presidential election or in its aftermath would bring moscow once again into conflict with europe and the united states .
medvedev is unlikely to lose much sleep over any eu response should the kremlin - one way or another - install its favored candidate in the kyiv hot seat .
the eu , currently hugely dependent on russian gas , imposed no serious penalty on moscow over the war with georgia and recent signs hint that russia will escape just as lightly if it succeeds in undercutting ukraine 's independence .
at their recent meeting chancellor merkel , standing beside medvedev when he so publicly severed ties with ukraine in sochi , remained silent on the issue .
merkel , the head of the eu 's largest country , offered no support for ukraine as a democratic partner , nor defended the right of its people to choose their leaders for themselves , stunning ukrainian officials with her reticence while presumably prompting quiet satisfaction in moscow .
" we are unlikely to see any public challenge to russia from the eu should moscow interfere in ukraine , " said nicu popescu .
" the eu avoids high politics when it can and works below the radar on technical and trade levels ; providing credit , creating stability and promoting reforms .
the eu will keep out of this election whatever happens and certainly wo n't favor any one candidate over another .
something major will have to happen for the eu to get involved . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv . despite leaving the shackles of the kremlin 's influence behind following the 1991 collapse of the soviet union , ukraine has yet to find any real peace away from its former master .
the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .
these fears were heightened after medvedev submitted legislation to parliament last week that will give him powers to deploy the military abroad " to defend the interests of russia and its citizens . "
prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .
" there are two schools of thinking in the kremlin over ukraine .
one wants moscow to push for a pro-russia elite in kyiv , one which is open to doing business with russia , one which is loyal and reliable and which will honor and implement deals struck between the two countries . " " the other school would prefer to see yushchenko stay in power as he is seen as incompetent , " he added . " this stimulates chaos and uncertainty in ukraine and makes it vulnerable to russia ’ s wishes .
this also serves the purpose of showing that post-soviet states can ’ t work without russia and that one day , they will have to come under the protection of some russia-led bloc once again . " russia unconcerned with potential european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was silent as medvedev signaled russia 's intensions any interference by russia in january 's presidential election or in its aftermath would bring moscow once again into conflict with europe and the united states .

while the star detective solves crimes , the books carefully uncover even greater mysteries about wroclaw 's german history . when crime writer marek krajewski tours poland to meet with his readers , he attracts more fans than nearly any other polish author , which may be because krajewski is not the typical thriller writer . his dark detective novels are very original and feature the feisty , fiercely independent and lecherous inspector eberhardt mock .
krajewski is also a classical scholar with a penchant for latin verse , literary allusions , and above all , a love of the pre-world war ii history of the city of breslau - now called wroclaw - in south-western poland . fascination with the past growing up in wroclaw during the cold war , krajewski was intrigued to find out more about the city whose communist rulers had done their best to erase all traces of the german past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw , on the oder river , was became part of poland in 1945 back in the early 1990s , after communism had fallen and wroclaw 's history was no longer taboo , a large number of photo albums devoted to pre-war architecture were published , said the author .
this piqued his interest in the era . " i practically moved into the wroclaw university library , " he said .
" i love leafing through old books , records , historical monographs and address books .
i read old 1920s and 1930s german newspapers .
this enables me to grasp the flavor of the time . " thanks to his detailed research , krajewski knows , for example , which perfumes his main character ’ s young wife would have used , and which brand of cigarettes inspector mock would have smoked . each story about inspector mock starts out as a straight detective novel , along the lines of agatha christie or conan doyle , but then it drifts off into juicy images of stodgy silesian cuisine , drinking feasts , jewish street markets , and local theater productions . krajewski includes details from the glamorous lifestyle of breslau ’ s rich and famous as well as from the daily lives of the city ’ s lower classes - including plenty of anecdotes about historical breslau inhabitants . city of diversity and integration those who think they have picked up an airport novel end up with question marks about the nature of european identity and the overlay of cultures in a city with shifting populations .
until world war ii , breslau had been a place where german , jews , poles and other minorities lived together in relative peace and tolerance . krajewski " was certainly the first to give this nostalgia a literary shape , bringing the past back , making it more visible and showing the roots , which was not only valuable from the literary point of view , but also culturally acceptable , " said literary critic krzysztof fordonski . the way krajewski structures a literary work out of minute elements of the past is unconventional for polish literature , added fordonski .
" this gives his books credibility which transcends what we normally expect from a detective story . " although a feature film about inspector mock has yet to be shot , several tv dramatizations of the series have already been made .
there is also talk of a major polish-german film co-production that would introduce inspector mock to mainstream european audiences .

krajewski is also a classical scholar with a penchant for latin verse , literary allusions , and above all , a love of the pre-world war ii history of the city of breslau - now called wroclaw - in south-western poland . fascination with the past growing up in wroclaw during the cold war , krajewski was intrigued to find out more about the city whose communist rulers had done their best to erase all traces of the german past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw , on the oder river , was became part of poland in 1945 back in the early 1990s , after communism had fallen and wroclaw 's history was no longer taboo , a large number of photo albums devoted to pre-war architecture were published , said the author .

" this gives his books credibility which transcends what we normally expect from a detective story . " although a feature film about inspector mock has yet to be shot , several tv dramatizations of the series have already been made .

this time , inspector mock investigates a grisly murder case involving rape and cannibalism which takes him from breslau to what was then the eastern polish city of lvov , now known as lviv in western ukraine . breslau is the ukrainian equivalent of lvov : after the war , the germans in breslau were expelled to germany , while the poles in lvov were forced back into poland .

inspector mock leaves breslau and ends up in the us , while the polish inspector he teams up with in lvov would most likely have been resettled to mock ’ s home town . critic krzysztof fordonski said that by setting his novel in the two cities on the eve of the war , krajewski provides a missing link in central european literature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 24.08.2009 polish crime writer uncovers wroclaw 's german history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw is - and was - a city full of mystery polish author marek krajewski writes gripping mystery novels that fly off the shelves .
while the star detective solves crimes , the books carefully uncover even greater mysteries about wroclaw 's german history . when crime writer marek krajewski tours poland to meet with his readers , he attracts more fans than nearly any other polish author , which may be because krajewski is not the typical thriller writer . his dark detective novels are very original and feature the feisty , fiercely independent and lecherous inspector eberhardt mock .
krajewski is also a classical scholar with a penchant for latin verse , literary allusions , and above all , a love of the pre-world war ii history of the city of breslau - now called wroclaw - in south-western poland . fascination with the past growing up in wroclaw during the cold war , krajewski was intrigued to find out more about the city whose communist rulers had done their best to erase all traces of the german past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw , on the oder river , was became part of poland in 1945 back in the early 1990s , after communism had fallen and wroclaw 's history was no longer taboo , a large number of photo albums devoted to pre-war architecture were published , said the author .
this piqued his interest in the era . " i practically moved into the wroclaw university library , " he said .
" i love leafing through old books , records , historical monographs and address books .
i read old 1920s and 1930s german newspapers .
this enables me to grasp the flavor of the time . " thanks to his detailed research , krajewski knows , for example , which perfumes his main character ’ s young wife would have used , and which brand of cigarettes inspector mock would have smoked . each story about inspector mock starts out as a straight detective novel , along the lines of agatha christie or conan doyle , but then it drifts off into juicy images of stodgy silesian cuisine , drinking feasts , jewish street markets , and local theater productions . krajewski includes details from the glamorous lifestyle of breslau ’ s rich and famous as well as from the daily lives of the city ’ s lower classes - including plenty of anecdotes about historical breslau inhabitants . city of diversity and integration those who think they have picked up an airport novel end up with question marks about the nature of european identity and the overlay of cultures in a city with shifting populations .
until world war ii , breslau had been a place where german , jews , poles and other minorities lived together in relative peace and tolerance . krajewski " was certainly the first to give this nostalgia a literary shape , bringing the past back , making it more visible and showing the roots , which was not only valuable from the literary point of view , but also culturally acceptable , " said literary critic krzysztof fordonski . the way krajewski structures a literary work out of minute elements of the past is unconventional for polish literature , added fordonski .
" this gives his books credibility which transcends what we normally expect from a detective story . " although a feature film about inspector mock has yet to be shot , several tv dramatizations of the series have already been made .
there is also talk of a major polish-german film co-production that would introduce inspector mock to mainstream european audiences . " krajewski is the first to recreate this world with lots of character , so you are moved back to those times in wroclaw , " said actress edyta bach , who grew up in the city .
" i think wroclaw has some mysteries .
there are lots of places in wroclaw which are not yet discovered . " another taboo to the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books have been translated into german and other languages in his latest novel , " minotaur 's head , " krajewski sets the scene for a debate about post-war mass expulsions , a topic that remains very touchy in poland .
this time , inspector mock investigates a grisly murder case involving rape and cannibalism which takes him from breslau to what was then the eastern polish city of lvov , now known as lviv in western ukraine . breslau is the ukrainian equivalent of lvov : after the war , the germans in breslau were expelled to germany , while the poles in lvov were forced back into poland .
these post-war expulsions , marked by violence , pilfering , and death , are a painful memory that many have preferred to suppress over the past six decades . all the book ’ s characters would have been driven out of their homes .
inspector mock leaves breslau and ends up in the us , while the polish inspector he teams up with in lvov would most likely have been resettled to mock ’ s home town . critic krzysztof fordonski said that by setting his novel in the two cities on the eve of the war , krajewski provides a missing link in central european literature . " i think that by setting his latest book in lviv he broke much more of a taboo because we got used to the fact that the western territories of poland were german until 1945 , " he said .
" but -lrb- he addresses -rrb- the remembrance of the eastern polish territories , giving it a literary shape . " krajewski ’ s books have been translated into a dozen languages , including german , english and hebrew .
a documentary about his work has won this year ’ s polish-german journalists award . author : rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talking to dw , prof. wintermantel insists that professors taking money for accepting unfit students are an exception . about 100 teaching staff at german universities are under investigation by prosecutors for allegedly taking bribes from self-styled phd counselling services in return for accepting phd students not up to the job . the president of germany 's university rectors conference , professor margret wintermantel said in an interview with deutsche welle that corrupt acadmics have no place in the profession .
but insists that the problem lies with individuals , insisting that the german system of higher education is safe and sound . dw : professor wintermantel , when have phd counselling services contacted you the last time ? margret wintermantel : never actually .
neither have colleagues that i know personally .
none of them has ever mentioned to me anything of the sort . what is it that is questionable or even illegal about phd counselling agencies ? i think it is very important that a student who wants to get a phd has to deliver their own unique contribution to research .
if students , using these services , can not show that it is their own contribution with their own piece of research , then we have a problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professors at berlin 's free university are among those being investigated for corruption if students have used those services to get a supervisor , but have otherwise put together their work all by themselves , would they still have to worry about losing their phds ? no , they should not worry about that .
again , if they can show that they have carried out their own research then they should not worry about that .
at most universities students have to include a sworn declaration that what they are presenting is exclusively their own work unless stated otherwise .
the requirement to include this declaration is now standard in exam regulations at most german universities .
this is in fact also the result of a recommendation we made back in 1994 . prosecutors in cologne are investigating close to a hundred professors at german universities , and one phd counselling agency has essentially been shut down .
but there are many more out there .
one might be inclined to think this is just the tip of the iceberg … … no , i do n't think so .
and i want to be perfectly clear - i do n't think so at all .
there are a lot of procedures of quality assurance in the universities , especially when it comes to the question of unique contributions to research .
german universities have precise admissions regulations for phd candidates throughout , there is continuous supervision of phd students .
and of course we should not forget that phd theses get published and are being made accessible to the scientific community where they are and remain subject to intense scientific scrutiny .
so , i think , there is no iceberg . yes , there are some people who jump red lights and then this is a case for the authorities .
but by far most of the phd students do good work and their professors do good work in showing them how to do good research .
we have a problem with a few people , but it is not a problem of the system . most of the faculty members now under investigation are contract staff and associate professors , less so full university professors .
is this also a reflection of the precarious financial situation that many teachers find themselves in who are not fully part of the university hierarchy ? no .
our position is that a phd student should be supervised by a full university professor .
associate professors should not have a central role here .
contract professors are entitled to supervise students and that is perfectly ok .
but to say ' i take bribes because i earn so little ' is totally unacceptable . is there a danger that the scandal could undermine the reputation of germany 's higher education system abroad and that in future fewer international students would chose to go for german universities ? if we insist on blowing this out of proportion - maybe .

if students , using these services , can not show that it is their own contribution with their own piece of research , then we have a problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professors at berlin 's free university are among those being investigated for corruption if students have used those services to get a supervisor , but have otherwise put together their work all by themselves , would they still have to worry about losing their phds ? no , they should not worry about that .
again , if they can show that they have carried out their own research then they should not worry about that .
at most universities students have to include a sworn declaration that what they are presenting is exclusively their own work unless stated otherwise .
the requirement to include this declaration is now standard in exam regulations at most german universities .
this is in fact also the result of a recommendation we made back in 1994 . prosecutors in cologne are investigating close to a hundred professors at german universities , and one phd counselling agency has essentially been shut down .
but there are many more out there .
one might be inclined to think this is just the tip of the iceberg … … no , i do n't think so .
and i want to be perfectly clear - i do n't think so at all .
there are a lot of procedures of quality assurance in the universities , especially when it comes to the question of unique contributions to research .
german universities have precise admissions regulations for phd candidates throughout , there is continuous supervision of phd students .
and of course we should not forget that phd theses get published and are being made accessible to the scientific community where they are and remain subject to intense scientific scrutiny .
so , i think , there is no iceberg . yes , there are some people who jump red lights and then this is a case for the authorities .
but by far most of the phd students do good work and their professors do good work in showing them how to do good research .
we have a problem with a few people , but it is not a problem of the system . most of the faculty members now under investigation are contract staff and associate professors , less so full university professors .
is this also a reflection of the precarious financial situation that many teachers find themselves in who are not fully part of the university hierarchy ? no .
our position is that a phd student should be supervised by a full university professor .
associate professors should not have a central role here .
contract professors are entitled to supervise students and that is perfectly ok .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.08.2009 opinion : gm is happy to keep its opel unit in limbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could bankruptcy be the right thing for opel ?
opel 's future is hanging by a thread , and its bankrupt parent company , us carmaker general motors , seems happy to keep it that way for the time being .
dw 's karl zawadzky comments . no decision is , in fact , a decision .
the future of the ailing car maker opel is still up in the air , threatened by the ongoing german election and the outlook for new difficulties in the company 's fortunes . the german government and the governments of the german three states with opel subsidiaries can clamor as much as they want : opel 's parent company , general motors , continues to drag out the game .
having filed for bankruptcy as quickly as possible , the american car giant 's detroit managers are giving themselves time to decide the future of their european business - and the fate of its german unit . but pressure is building .
some 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.15 billion -rrb- of german tax money that went into saving opel from bankruptcy will be used up by the end of this year .
worse , the government-sponsored " wrecking-premium , " that allowed people to trade clunkers for cash towards a new car , will run out in a few weeks - and that scheme had given a serious boost to opel sales in germany .
that means even more difficult times are ahead for opel , since despite the wrecking premium , opel has continued to post losses in the millions . time for the next choice soon enough , the german government and the affected states will face a choice : let opel declare bankruptcy , or give it another cash injection in the billions . the american parent was reorganized under bankruptcy protection and with the aid of many billions of dollars from washington .
once the largest company in the world , gm now belongs to the us taxpayer .
and now , its managers in detroit are in no hurry to make a decision .
there are even some indications that they wo n't bother to sell their european activities at all - but will instead try to use european taxpayer monies and do the reorganizing job themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky in any case , it certainly looks as if the americans do n't plan to sell gm 's european car business to the preferred german suitor : a consortium made up of canadian-austrian car-parts maker magna , russia 's sberbank , and russian automaker gaz .
maintaining a minority stake in opel would keep general motors ' hand in the european market .
gm sees itself as an international car maker , and wants to maintain a presence in europe .
this is why the management in detroit would prefer it if investment firm rhj , which is taking a majority stake in opel , would take over the company , reorganize it , and sell it back to gm . moreover , its worth bearing in mind that if opel were to leave the gm group permanently , it would be bad news for gm : opel is the company 's center for development of small cars and engines - in other words , the future of general motors . competition from the russians general motors is extremely critical of the russian involvement in the magna consortium .
for the russians , taking over opel would be a milestone on the road to bringing the decaying russian auto industry up to a european level .
meanwhile , general motors itself wants to build and sell cars in russia .
it has no interest in giving the competition a boost in this important market . gm is playing for time , and it is putting pressure on the german government and the states .
at the same time , it is also an attempt to avoid turning this extremely unpopular issue into grist for the electoral mill in the coming parliamentary elections .
in other words , it wo n't be until after the elections that gm will say what will become of opel . the germans could be ramping up the pressure , of course .
gm no longer holds the majority stake in opel ; it is held by five trustees , including two americans and one german , as well as a chairman who wo n't take part in the conflict .
all together that means that even if there was a blockade , there would be no decision .
it would be a sure path to bankruptcy for opel , and perhaps not the worst choice .
in that case , the bankruptcy administrator would simply sell opel to the highest bidder .
and that is not necessarily us parent company gm . karl zawadzky is the head of deutsche welle 's economics bureau . -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de fearful of job cuts , germany urges gm to decide opel 's fate with the national election only five weeks away , german politicians are stepping up the pressure on general motors to choose a candidate to take over its troubled opel subsidiary .
-lrb- 23.08.2009 -rrb- germany regrets gm 's indecision regarding opel germany 's economics minister said on saturday he regretted that general motors ' board had failed to take a decision on a deal covering its european operations , including ailing german unit opel .

opel 's future is hanging by a thread , and its bankrupt parent company , us carmaker general motors , seems happy to keep it that way for the time being .
dw 's karl zawadzky comments . no decision is , in fact , a decision .
the future of the ailing car maker opel is still up in the air , threatened by the ongoing german election and the outlook for new difficulties in the company 's fortunes . the german government and the governments of the german three states with opel subsidiaries can clamor as much as they want : opel 's parent company , general motors , continues to drag out the game .
having filed for bankruptcy as quickly as possible , the american car giant 's detroit managers are giving themselves time to decide the future of their european business - and the fate of its german unit . but pressure is building .
some 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.15 billion -rrb- of german tax money that went into saving opel from bankruptcy will be used up by the end of this year .
worse , the government-sponsored " wrecking-premium , " that allowed people to trade clunkers for cash towards a new car , will run out in a few weeks - and that scheme had given a serious boost to opel sales in germany .
that means even more difficult times are ahead for opel , since despite the wrecking premium , opel has continued to post losses in the millions . time for the next choice soon enough , the german government and the affected states will face a choice : let opel declare bankruptcy , or give it another cash injection in the billions . the american parent was reorganized under bankruptcy protection and with the aid of many billions of dollars from washington .
once the largest company in the world , gm now belongs to the us taxpayer .
and now , its managers in detroit are in no hurry to make a decision .
there are even some indications that they wo n't bother to sell their european activities at all - but will instead try to use european taxpayer monies and do the reorganizing job themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky in any case , it certainly looks as if the americans do n't plan to sell gm 's european car business to the preferred german suitor : a consortium made up of canadian-austrian car-parts maker magna , russia 's sberbank , and russian automaker gaz .
maintaining a minority stake in opel would keep general motors ' hand in the european market .
gm sees itself as an international car maker , and wants to maintain a presence in europe .
this is why the management in detroit would prefer it if investment firm rhj , which is taking a majority stake in opel , would take over the company , reorganize it , and sell it back to gm . moreover , its worth bearing in mind that if opel were to leave the gm group permanently , it would be bad news for gm : opel is the company 's center for development of small cars and engines - in other words , the future of general motors . competition from the russians general motors is extremely critical of the russian involvement in the magna consortium .
for the russians , taking over opel would be a milestone on the road to bringing the decaying russian auto industry up to a european level .
meanwhile , general motors itself wants to build and sell cars in russia .
it has no interest in giving the competition a boost in this important market . gm is playing for time , and it is putting pressure on the german government and the states .
at the same time , it is also an attempt to avoid turning this extremely unpopular issue into grist for the electoral mill in the coming parliamentary elections .
in other words , it wo n't be until after the elections that gm will say what will become of opel . the germans could be ramping up the pressure , of course .
gm no longer holds the majority stake in opel ; it is held by five trustees , including two americans and one german , as well as a chairman who wo n't take part in the conflict .
all together that means that even if there was a blockade , there would be no decision .
it would be a sure path to bankruptcy for opel , and perhaps not the worst choice .
in that case , the bankruptcy administrator would simply sell opel to the highest bidder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 24.08.2009 quelle heiress likely to lose everything in arcandor liquidation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schickedanz , 65 , was once one of germany 's richest heiresses the heiress to the quelle mail-order shopping empire , madeleine schickedanz , looks set to lose her entire fortune as german retail group arcandor goes into liquidation . a partner at the law firm overseeing the proceedings , rolf weidmann , told the handelsblatt newspaper that arcandor shareholders are likely to lose their investments because german bankruptcy law requires the concern to meet all other creditors ' demands before making payments to investors .
the newspaper then cited sources familiar with the company as saying it " would take a miracle " for any of the shareholders to see their money again .
that includes schickedanz , whose shares in karstadt-quelle - as arcandor was formerly known - were once valued at some three billion euros .
other stakeholders include the sal .
oppenheim private bank , which invested hundreds of millions of euros in the company last year , as well as thousands of small investors , who together own about 51 percent of arcandor stock .
no funds for a rescue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competing retailers are keen to cherry-pick arcandor 's most valuable assets arcandor is expected to enter liquidation once insolvency proceedings are officially launched on september 1 .
while administrators initially planned on using bankruptcy laws to allow arcandor managers to reorganize the company , major shareholders including schickedanz and sal .
oppenheim refused to pump any more cash into the troubled company .
the luxembourg-based bank has itself been struggling with the effects of the global economic downturn .
earlier this month it turned to deutsche bank for a 300-million-euro capital injection .
madeleine schickedanz , meanwhile , seemed to predict her financial downfall in an interview she held with the bild am sonntag newspaper last month .
" if the rescue of arcandor fails and the banks call in their loans , i 'll lose everything - houses , shares , interests in other firms .
at 65 years of age i wo n't even be eligible for a state pension , " she told the newspaper , adding that she had already cut back her expenditure on clothing and cosmetics .
" i save where i can .
we 're living on 500 to 600 euros a month , and shopping at discount supermarkets , " she said .
partial sale not an option as proceedings continue , administrators have ruled out the splitting up assets belonging to arcandor 's department store unit karstadt , effectively ruling out partial sales to competing retailers such as metro and sportscheck .

more planes were due to arrive later monday and tuesday from spain and turkey .
in addition , the eu mobilized two further planes from its european tactical reserve of fire-fighting aircraft -lrb- eufftr -rrb- , said mann .
established to assist eu member states that face major fires , the eufftr makes planes available during the summer in a project costing 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and eu countries have sent in planes to help put out the flames " they are being financed by the eu and have been leased from july 1 to september 30 , " mann said .
" the idea is to help member states with their own efforts . "
the two eu fire fighting planes are stationed on corsica , putting them close to both france and italy and almost exactly halfway between lisbon and athens , according to the european commission .
the planes have already been dispatched five times this summer ; most recently to battle the fires in portugal a few weeks ago .
residents fight flames alongside firefighters working round the clock , firefighters managed to contain all but six major fires burning across greece .
ongoing fires include those on the islands of evia , skyros and on the ionian island of zakynthos .
" we are making progress in limiting the fires , " said fire brigade chief yiannis kappakis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many residents failed to heed the evacuation warning until the fires were too close blazes were still spreading further to the north of athens near the coastal towns of pikermi , porto germano and nea makri , where rescue crews managed to evacuate a dozen nuns safely from an endangered monastery as fires raced down the hill towards them .
the wildfires , which started in the early hours of saturday , swept through homes , caused massive evacuations of entire towns and destroyed more than 40,000 acres -lrb- 16,190 hectares -rrb- of forest and olives groves .
a state of emergency was in effect for days as reinforcements and military personnel were called in .
many athenians who ignored calls to evacuate their neighborhoods could be seen fighting the flames outside their homes with water hoses and branches .
others , armed with shovels and buckets , worked side by side with firefighters and soldiers throughout the night to battle the fires .
at least half a dozen people were being treated for minor burns and breathing problems , the health ministry said monday .
bildunterschrift : fires have been burning since saturday prime minister criticized over response even as prime minister costas karamanlis toured the fire-affected areas , he faced harsh criticism for the poor handling of the fires .
opposition party leaders and mayors said the response resembled that when fires struck the island of evia and the peloponnese in 2007 , killing more than 80 people .
mayors across the are around athens made frantic calls to greek television stations asking for firefighters to be sent to their communities , insisting their was no central body in place to respond to their requests .
" there are still huge shortages in the firefighting infrastructure which should have been looked after following the fires two years ago , " said aleka papariga , leader of the communist party of greece .
speaking to journalists , government spokesperson evangelos antonaros insisted that the firefighting efforts were well coordinated .
" from the first instance , the presence of firefighters and other rescue operations were present to a large degree . "
officials have not officially said what started the fire , but forest fires have become more frequent in greece in recent summers , due to high temperatures , drought , and also arson , often by land developers. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more planes were due to arrive later monday and tuesday from spain and turkey .
in addition , the eu mobilized two further planes from its european tactical reserve of fire-fighting aircraft -lrb- eufftr -rrb- , said mann .
established to assist eu member states that face major fires , the eufftr makes planes available during the summer in a project costing 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and eu countries have sent in planes to help put out the flames " they are being financed by the eu and have been leased from july 1 to september 30 , " mann said .
" the idea is to help member states with their own efforts . "
the two eu fire fighting planes are stationed on corsica , putting them close to both france and italy and almost exactly halfway between lisbon and athens , according to the european commission .
the planes have already been dispatched five times this summer ; most recently to battle the fires in portugal a few weeks ago .
residents fight flames alongside firefighters working round the clock , firefighters managed to contain all but six major fires burning across greece .
ongoing fires include those on the islands of evia , skyros and on the ionian island of zakynthos .
" we are making progress in limiting the fires , " said fire brigade chief yiannis kappakis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many residents failed to heed the evacuation warning until the fires were too close blazes were still spreading further to the north of athens near the coastal towns of pikermi , porto germano and nea makri , where rescue crews managed to evacuate a dozen nuns safely from an endangered monastery as fires raced down the hill towards them .
the wildfires , which started in the early hours of saturday , swept through homes , caused massive evacuations of entire towns and destroyed more than 40,000 acres -lrb- 16,190 hectares -rrb- of forest and olives groves .
a state of emergency was in effect for days as reinforcements and military personnel were called in .
many athenians who ignored calls to evacuate their neighborhoods could be seen fighting the flames outside their homes with water hoses and branches .
others , armed with shovels and buckets , worked side by side with firefighters and soldiers throughout the night to battle the fires .
at least half a dozen people were being treated for minor burns and breathing problems , the health ministry said monday .
bildunterschrift : fires have been burning since saturday prime minister criticized over response even as prime minister costas karamanlis toured the fire-affected areas , he faced harsh criticism for the poor handling of the fires .
opposition party leaders and mayors said the response resembled that when fires struck the island of evia and the peloponnese in 2007 , killing more than 80 people .
mayors across the are around athens made frantic calls to greek television stations asking for firefighters to be sent to their communities , insisting their was no central body in place to respond to their requests .
" there are still huge shortages in the firefighting infrastructure which should have been looked after following the fires two years ago , " said aleka papariga , leader of the communist party of greece .
speaking to journalists , government spokesperson evangelos antonaros insisted that the firefighting efforts were well coordinated .
" from the first instance , the presence of firefighters and other rescue operations were present to a large degree . "
officials have not officially said what started the fire , but forest fires have become more frequent in greece in recent summers , due to high temperatures , drought , and also arson , often by land developers. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more planes were due to arrive later monday and tuesday from spain and turkey .
in addition , the eu mobilized two further planes from its european tactical reserve of fire-fighting aircraft -lrb- eufftr -rrb- , said mann .
established to assist eu member states that face major fires , the eufftr makes planes available during the summer in a project costing 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and eu countries have sent in planes to help put out the flames " they are being financed by the eu and have been leased from july 1 to september 30 , " mann said .
" the idea is to help member states with their own efforts . "
the two eu fire fighting planes are stationed on corsica , putting them close to both france and italy and almost exactly halfway between lisbon and athens , according to the european commission .
the planes have already been dispatched five times this summer ; most recently to battle the fires in portugal a few weeks ago .
residents fight flames alongside firefighters working round the clock , firefighters managed to contain all but six major fires burning across greece .
ongoing fires include those on the islands of evia , skyros and on the ionian island of zakynthos .
" we are making progress in limiting the fires , " said fire brigade chief yiannis kappakis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many residents failed to heed the evacuation warning until the fires were too close blazes were still spreading further to the north of athens near the coastal towns of pikermi , porto germano and nea makri , where rescue crews managed to evacuate a dozen nuns safely from an endangered monastery as fires raced down the hill towards them .
the wildfires , which started in the early hours of saturday , swept through homes , caused massive evacuations of entire towns and destroyed more than 40,000 acres -lrb- 16,190 hectares -rrb- of forest and olives groves .
a state of emergency was in effect for days as reinforcements and military personnel were called in .
many athenians who ignored calls to evacuate their neighborhoods could be seen fighting the flames outside their homes with water hoses and branches .
others , armed with shovels and buckets , worked side by side with firefighters and soldiers throughout the night to battle the fires .
at least half a dozen people were being treated for minor burns and breathing problems , the health ministry said monday .
bildunterschrift : fires have been burning since saturday prime minister criticized over response even as prime minister costas karamanlis toured the fire-affected areas , he faced harsh criticism for the poor handling of the fires .
opposition party leaders and mayors said the response resembled that when fires struck the island of evia and the peloponnese in 2007 , killing more than 80 people .
mayors across the are around athens made frantic calls to greek television stations asking for firefighters to be sent to their communities , insisting their was no central body in place to respond to their requests .
" there are still huge shortages in the firefighting infrastructure which should have been looked after following the fires two years ago , " said aleka papariga , leader of the communist party of greece .
speaking to journalists , government spokesperson evangelos antonaros insisted that the firefighting efforts were well coordinated .
" from the first instance , the presence of firefighters and other rescue operations were present to a large degree . "
officials have not officially said what started the fire , but forest fires have become more frequent in greece in recent summers , due to high temperatures , drought , and also arson , often by land developers. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the left 's position as the direct successors of the party of democratic socialism and by extension the ruling party of former east germany , the sed , is still a stigma . problematic past part of this reputation is down to the controversial past of gregor gysi , co-chairman of the left 's parliamentary group .
a member of the sed since 1967 , gysi rose to prominence around the time of germany 's reunification , playing an instrumental part in the internal re-organization of the sed and its reinvention as the pds , of which he became the first party chairman .

now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .

now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .
they are determined to scrap germany 's compulsory military service -lrb- germany is one of the few remaining nato countries with a conscripted army -rrb- , and to reduce the size of the army generally .
they also want to seize the initiative of us president barack obama 's election to push for better relations with iran and north korea .

but if recent state level success continues , the left party will become difficult to ignore . a glance at the left party 's website shows where its priorities and its ambitions lie .
" the left party is entering these elections aspiring to take part in the formation of governments , and it is prepared to lead these governments , " the homepage reads .
though it was founded in 2005 under the name electoral alternative for labor and social justice , the left party has apparently shed its oppositional position and is beginning to feel strong enough to test its socialist agenda in government . despite ostensible successes at a regional level and a clear national profile in the media , the left party is still regarded as political poison by its rivals in the west of the country – any hint that a politician might harbor fantasies of a coalition with the left generally ignites a round of indignation .
the left 's position as the direct successors of the party of democratic socialism and by extension the ruling party of former east germany , the sed , is still a stigma . problematic past part of this reputation is down to the controversial past of gregor gysi , co-chairman of the left 's parliamentary group .
a member of the sed since 1967 , gysi rose to prominence around the time of germany 's reunification , playing an instrumental part in the internal re-organization of the sed and its reinvention as the pds , of which he became the first party chairman .
his charisma and rhetorical gift made him an important leader of the left party , but his record has been stained recently by accusations that he was an informant for the east german secret police , the stasi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi has been both a popular and shadowy element in the left 's leadership after steadily improving election results throughout the 1990s , the pds / left party managed to enter coalition governments , or support spd-led minority governments , in a few states in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
much of its success in the west depends on oskar lafontaine , the high-profile spd defector whose pugnacious media presence has given the party its recent national profile . social and economic policy lafontaine 's statements , such as " we want to overthrow capitalism , " in an interview with der spiegel in may 2009 , frequently give the impression that the party deliberately fosters this provocative anti-establishment image .
but its policies , though radical , are not anti-democratic . central to its economic policy is a keynesian use of state intervention to balance market forces .
in the current election program , this includes socializing the entire banking system , outlawing non-transparent financial products , hedge funds , and venture capitalism , and restricting currency markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reversing schroeder 's social welfare reforms has been a unifying cause in the left party on a social level , the left 's economic plan would mean the introduction of a minimum hourly wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14.30 -rrb- , raising top-rate income tax from 42 percent to 53 percent , and scrapping the hartz iv unemployment benefit reforms introduced under gerhard schroeder 's government .
as a stop-gap during this transition , the left would raise long-term unemployment benefit , currently at 345 euros a month , to 500 euros , raise child benefit to 200 euros a month , and introduce a minimum pension of 800 euros . there would be a similar spending spree in education .
the left would not only ditch university tuition fees , but would redirect a full 7 percent of germany 's gross domestic product into education .
the three-tier , ability-based school system would also be abandoned in favor of a universal school until 10th grade . energy goals the left also has a decidedly green agenda on the environment , seeing fossil fuels and nuclear energy as relics of the 20th century .
like the green party , it hopes to switch germany onto renewable energies , though with a slightly more conservative timeframe than the greens , eventually lowering germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent by 2050 . but the left party takes a harder line on nuclear power , for which it believes the safety risks are unacceptable .
if in power , the party would demand that all nuclear power plants be shut down as soon as possible , and would introduce a ban on exporting nuclear technology . foreign and security policy on foreign policy and security issues , the left party is equally uncompromising .
it demands an immediate withdrawal of the german army from afghanistan , and in fact would end all german army missions abroad .
on top of this , the left party would like to see nato replaced by a collective security organization with russia as a member . in the question of internal security , the left party perhaps belies its roots in the dictatorial gdr .
in power , it would end the new anti-terrorist powers granted to the police , for example , banning remote online searches and the storage of personal data .
it would also ban the far-right national democratic party , lower the voting age to 16 , and introduce voting rights for immigrants . author : ben knight editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as its name suggests , the cdu is christian-based but aims to appeal to broad cross-section of society .
anyone may join the party , which has pursued a neo-liberal since helmut kohl 's time as germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 .
the party 's 2009 election slogan , " we have the strength , " is an attempt to position chancellor angela merkel as the only politician able to drag germany out of the economic crisis .
" we have the power to make germany stronger than it was before the crisis , " merkel said when presenting her election program to the public in june .
fiscal policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's conservatives want to cut taxes to overcome economic crisis germany 's two conservative parties strongly reject tax increases to finance current measures to stabilize financial markets and stimulate economic growth .
instead they aim to boost domestic consumption with a two-step cut in the lowest income tax bracket , from 14 to 12 percent .
they also want to raise the threshold above which income is taxed at the highest rate of 42 percent to 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,600 -rrb- from 52,552 euros .
the cdu / csu call for reforms to limit the impact of " cold progression " - the process by which taxpayers are shifted into higher tax brackets thus reducing their real income after a pay raise .
the conservatives also say they will examine corporate taxes to ensure they do not over-burden firms .
however , the envisaged tax measures are dependent on the next government 's financial room to maneuver .
in labor market policy , the two conservative parties are strictly against the introduction of a nationwide minimum wage , arguing that wage policy must remain an issue of collective bargaining between labor and business .
reforming international financial markets merkel 's conservatives blame lax oversight on the part of banks and international financial markets for the current financial crisis .
they say the european union 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro , must be strengthened , and they reject attempts to exert political influence over the european central bank .
they also press for stronger supervision of the banking sector , including an international code of conduct for hedge funds and ratings agencies .
social and education policies move center stage a strong emphasis on education and social policy marks a change from the conservative 's 2005 election program .
at the time , the social democrats won many votes by accusing merkel of being unsympathetic towards those in need in germany .
the cdu / csu want to increase government subsidies for families with children .
parents who take time off from work to care for newborn babies should also be allowed to work part-time and receive state aid for up to 28 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu family minister ursula von der leyen is the figurehead of the party 's new social policy they plan to match nationwide demand for childcare spots by 2013 , giving all parents guaranteed childcare for kids over one year of age .
in the long term , childcare facilities should be free for all , the program says .
merkel 's conservatives also want to introduce obligatory language tests from the age of four to identify and help children with deficits .
by 2012 , all children , including those from immigrant families , should be able to speak german sufficiently before entering school .
multilateral foreign policy chancellor merkel is eager to strengthen the transatlantic partnership with washington to forge agreement on crucial policy issues such as climate change and international security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel seeks close cooperation with the us good ties with russia , the bloc says , are in germany 's interest , although the depth of ties should depend on moscow 's willingness to meet international obligations .
the cdu / csu want to limit the risk of instability in afghanistan spilling into europe and believe greater emphasis must be placed on civilian reconstruction rather than military success .
nuclear energy crucial to curb climate change although the conservatives say they do n't want to build new nuclear plants , they argue this form of energy is a crucial part of a proper energy mix .
they want to undo germany 's 2002 nuclear phase-out accord by extending the life spans of some existing plants beyond the phase-out deadline of 2020 .
merkel 's conservatives are planning to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent over the next 11 years and to increase the amount of electricity generated in germany from renewable energy sources to 30 percent .
they say a post-kyoto agreement must agree binding climate goals with the united states and take developing countries on board. uh / reuters / dpa / afp editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

anyone may join the party , which has pursued a neo-liberal since helmut kohl 's time as germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 .
the party 's 2009 election slogan , " we have the strength , " is an attempt to position chancellor angela merkel as the only politician able to drag germany out of the economic crisis .
" we have the power to make germany stronger than it was before the crisis , " merkel said when presenting her election program to the public in june .
fiscal policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's conservatives want to cut taxes to overcome economic crisis germany 's two conservative parties strongly reject tax increases to finance current measures to stabilize financial markets and stimulate economic growth .
instead they aim to boost domestic consumption with a two-step cut in the lowest income tax bracket , from 14 to 12 percent .
they also want to raise the threshold above which income is taxed at the highest rate of 42 percent to 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,600 -rrb- from 52,552 euros .
the cdu / csu call for reforms to limit the impact of " cold progression " - the process by which taxpayers are shifted into higher tax brackets thus reducing their real income after a pay raise .
the conservatives also say they will examine corporate taxes to ensure they do not over-burden firms .
however , the envisaged tax measures are dependent on the next government 's financial room to maneuver .
in labor market policy , the two conservative parties are strictly against the introduction of a nationwide minimum wage , arguing that wage policy must remain an issue of collective bargaining between labor and business .
reforming international financial markets merkel 's conservatives blame lax oversight on the part of banks and international financial markets for the current financial crisis .
they say the european union 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro , must be strengthened , and they reject attempts to exert political influence over the european central bank .
they also press for stronger supervision of the banking sector , including an international code of conduct for hedge funds and ratings agencies .
social and education policies move center stage a strong emphasis on education and social policy marks a change from the conservative 's 2005 election program .
at the time , the social democrats won many votes by accusing merkel of being unsympathetic towards those in need in germany .
the cdu / csu want to increase government subsidies for families with children .
parents who take time off from work to care for newborn babies should also be allowed to work part-time and receive state aid for up to 28 months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu family minister ursula von der leyen is the figurehead of the party 's new social policy they plan to match nationwide demand for childcare spots by 2013 , giving all parents guaranteed childcare for kids over one year of age .
in the long term , childcare facilities should be free for all , the program says .
merkel 's conservatives also want to introduce obligatory language tests from the age of four to identify and help children with deficits .
by 2012 , all children , including those from immigrant families , should be able to speak german sufficiently before entering school .
multilateral foreign policy chancellor merkel is eager to strengthen the transatlantic partnership with washington to forge agreement on crucial policy issues such as climate change and international security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel seeks close cooperation with the us good ties with russia , the bloc says , are in germany 's interest , although the depth of ties should depend on moscow 's willingness to meet international obligations .
the cdu / csu want to limit the risk of instability in afghanistan spilling into europe and believe greater emphasis must be placed on civilian reconstruction rather than military success .
nuclear energy crucial to curb climate change although the conservatives say they do n't want to build new nuclear plants , they argue this form of energy is a crucial part of a proper energy mix .
they want to undo germany 's 2002 nuclear phase-out accord by extending the life spans of some existing plants beyond the phase-out deadline of 2020 .
merkel 's conservatives are planning to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent over the next 11 years and to increase the amount of electricity generated in germany from renewable energy sources to 30 percent .
they say a post-kyoto agreement must agree binding climate goals with the united states and take developing countries on board. uh / reuters / dpa / afp editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .
they are determined to scrap germany 's compulsory military service -lrb- germany is one of the few remaining nato countries with a conscripted army -rrb- , and to reduce the size of the army generally .
they also want to seize the initiative of us president barack obama 's election to push for better relations with iran and north korea .
the green party is also the german party with the most faith in the european union and would like to see the eu 's profile raised in the world . author : ben knight editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if recent state level success continues , the left party will become difficult to ignore . a glance at the left party 's website shows where its priorities and its ambitions lie .
" the left party is entering these elections aspiring to take part in the formation of governments , and it is prepared to lead these governments , " the homepage reads .
though it was founded in 2005 under the name electoral alternative for labor and social justice , the left party has apparently shed its oppositional position and is beginning to feel strong enough to test its socialist agenda in government . despite ostensible successes at a regional level and a clear national profile in the media , the left party is still regarded as political poison by its rivals in the west of the country – any hint that a politician might harbor fantasies of a coalition with the left generally ignites a round of indignation .
the left 's position as the direct successors of the party of democratic socialism and by extension the ruling party of former east germany , the sed , is still a stigma . problematic past part of this reputation is down to the controversial past of gregor gysi , co-chairman of the left 's parliamentary group .
a member of the sed since 1967 , gysi rose to prominence around the time of germany 's reunification , playing an instrumental part in the internal re-organization of the sed and its reinvention as the pds , of which he became the first party chairman .
his charisma and rhetorical gift made him an important leader of the left party , but his record has been stained recently by accusations that he was an informant for the east german secret police , the stasi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi has been both a popular and shadowy element in the left 's leadership after steadily improving election results throughout the 1990s , the pds / left party managed to enter coalition governments , or support spd-led minority governments , in a few states in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
much of its success in the west depends on oskar lafontaine , the high-profile spd defector whose pugnacious media presence has given the party its recent national profile . social and economic policy lafontaine 's statements , such as " we want to overthrow capitalism , " in an interview with der spiegel in may 2009 , frequently give the impression that the party deliberately fosters this provocative anti-establishment image .
but its policies , though radical , are not anti-democratic . central to its economic policy is a keynesian use of state intervention to balance market forces .
in the current election program , this includes socializing the entire banking system , outlawing non-transparent financial products , hedge funds , and venture capitalism , and restricting currency markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reversing schroeder 's social welfare reforms has been a unifying cause in the left party on a social level , the left 's economic plan would mean the introduction of a minimum hourly wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14.30 -rrb- , raising top-rate income tax from 42 percent to 53 percent , and scrapping the hartz iv unemployment benefit reforms introduced under gerhard schroeder 's government .
as a stop-gap during this transition , the left would raise long-term unemployment benefit , currently at 345 euros a month , to 500 euros , raise child benefit to 200 euros a month , and introduce a minimum pension of 800 euros . there would be a similar spending spree in education .
the left would not only ditch university tuition fees , but would redirect a full 7 percent of germany 's gross domestic product into education .
the three-tier , ability-based school system would also be abandoned in favor of a universal school until 10th grade . energy goals the left also has a decidedly green agenda on the environment , seeing fossil fuels and nuclear energy as relics of the 20th century .
like the green party , it hopes to switch germany onto renewable energies , though with a slightly more conservative timeframe than the greens , eventually lowering germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent by 2050 . but the left party takes a harder line on nuclear power , for which it believes the safety risks are unacceptable .
if in power , the party would demand that all nuclear power plants be shut down as soon as possible , and would introduce a ban on exporting nuclear technology . foreign and security policy on foreign policy and security issues , the left party is equally uncompromising .
it demands an immediate withdrawal of the german army from afghanistan , and in fact would end all german army missions abroad .
on top of this , the left party would like to see nato replaced by a collective security organization with russia as a member . in the question of internal security , the left party perhaps belies its roots in the dictatorial gdr .
in power , it would end the new anti-terrorist powers granted to the police , for example , banning remote online searches and the storage of personal data .
it would also ban the far-right national democratic party , lower the voting age to 16 , and introduce voting rights for immigrants . author : ben knight editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 24.08.2009 germany 's car scrapping scheme may have backfired großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car-scrapping bonus has had unwanted side-effects the german government has decided not to renew its car scrapping scheme , citing costs .
yet there are also concerns that instead of being crushed here , many cars are being illegally shipped to africa . in an effort to stimulate consumer spending , the german government has provided a scrap bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- for two million old cars this year .
on monday , germany announced it would not extend the subsidy , which has proved extremely popular .
many germans jumped at the chance to replace old cars with new ones .
but instead of being crushed here , as planned by the program , many cars end up in africa .
the german police association bund deutscher kriminalbeamter -lrb- bdk -rrb- has been bombarded with press interview requests ever since it estimated earlier this month that since january at least 50,000 cars have been exported illegally , after their owners had been granted the scrap bonus .
for his calculation bdk vice-chairman wilfried albishausen , who spent part of his career fighting organized crime , adapted criteria which are generaly used for estimating drug trafficking .
" the risk of being caught is extremely low , as there is hardly any control , " he told deutsche welle . " when someone is caught , punishment remains minimal .
thirdly there is a market for old cars in africa and eastern europe .
and the german scrap industry is in a bad shape and therefore more willing to ignore the law . "
gottfried hoell , chairman of the association for the german scrap industry , confirms what the police inspector assumes : 80 percent of the 1,400 officially registered scrappers , hoell says , he trusts blindly .
that leaves almost 300 whom he can not trust .
hoell understands the wrongdoers : " when a car scrapper has financial problems because of the bonus - because he is getting too many cars and has to rent extra space for them and at the same time sells less spare parts for old cars because the cars are no longer there - then of course when he gets an attractive offer in such a situation , he will not say no , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars have not ended up being scrapped during a recent visit to a scrap company in central germany , hoell met an interested african on the premises , who was willing to pay up to 2,500 euros for any bonus car .
that story does n't surprise a nigerian shipping agent based in the rhineland .
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , said he exports up to 150 cars a month to west africa .
he is not involved in illegal business himself , he said .
but he hears stories of exporters taking old cars apart before packing them in containers .
once they reach their destination , they are put together again .
business as usual if two million german old cars are shredded , one would expect a lack of used cars .
german used-car dealers confirm that their business this year sank to barely 20 percent of last year 's turnover .
but in an interview with german national radio deutschlandfunk , a dealer in cotonou , west africa 's main harbour of car imports in the republic of benin , said earlier this month he had n't noticed any difference .
the nigerian shipping agent has no problems either .
" from my situation i do n't think anything changed , " he said .
" from the business i have not noticed any change . "
the man exports mainly via antwerp , where belgian custom authorities may pay little attention to the german scrap bonus scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numerous cases of illegal used-car exports have been reported but even in german harbours like hamburg and bremerhaven customs can do little more than check freight papers , said the bdk 's albishausen .
" they just do n't have the capacity to open up every single container .
but when they check , they often find something .
in hamburg alone they detected nearly 50 cases of illegal used-car exports so far this year . "
five billion euros lost if the bottom line is that the german government 's environmental bonus stimulates the export of old cars , the environment may benefit very little .
" with that program five billion euros are going down the drain , " said spokeswoman ulrike fokken of the deutsche umwelthilfe , an environmental organisation in berlin .
" it is an old problem that germany dumps its garbage in africa , " she added .
scrapper gottfried höll laughs off the environmental justification , even for those cars that are demolished in germany in line with the scheme .
before they are crushed all the parts can be removed , including the old engine , to live a second life in europe .
or elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 24.08.2009 fears of regime change add new dimension to russia-ukraine tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rift between yushchenko and medvedev is set to widen as ukraine celebrates the 18th anniversary of its independence from soviet rule , the shadow of its former communist past still hangs heavy .
moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv . despite leaving the shackles of the kremlin 's influence behind following the 1991 collapse of the soviet union , ukraine has yet to find any real peace away from its former master .
the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .
these fears were heightened after medvedev submitted legislation to parliament last week that will give him powers to deploy the military abroad " to defend the interests of russia and its citizens . "
prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .
" there are two schools of thinking in the kremlin over ukraine .
one wants moscow to push for a pro-russia elite in kyiv , one which is open to doing business with russia , one which is loyal and reliable and which will honor and implement deals struck between the two countries . " " the other school would prefer to see yushchenko stay in power as he is seen as incompetent , " he added . " this stimulates chaos and uncertainty in ukraine and makes it vulnerable to russia ’ s wishes .
this also serves the purpose of showing that post-soviet states can ’ t work without russia and that one day , they will have to come under the protection of some russia-led bloc once again . " russia unconcerned with potential european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was silent as medvedev signaled russia 's intensions any interference by russia in january 's presidential election or in its aftermath would bring moscow once again into conflict with europe and the united states .
medvedev is unlikely to lose much sleep over any eu response should the kremlin - one way or another - install its favored candidate in the kyiv hot seat .
the eu , currently hugely dependent on russian gas , imposed no serious penalty on moscow over the war with georgia and recent signs hint that russia will escape just as lightly if it succeeds in undercutting ukraine 's independence .
at their recent meeting chancellor merkel , standing beside medvedev when he so publicly severed ties with ukraine in sochi , remained silent on the issue .
merkel , the head of the eu 's largest country , offered no support for ukraine as a democratic partner , nor defended the right of its people to choose their leaders for themselves , stunning ukrainian officials with her reticence while presumably prompting quiet satisfaction in moscow .
" we are unlikely to see any public challenge to russia from the eu should moscow interfere in ukraine , " said nicu popescu .
" the eu avoids high politics when it can and works below the radar on technical and trade levels ; providing credit , creating stability and promoting reforms .
the eu will keep out of this election whatever happens and certainly wo n't favor any one candidate over another .
something major will have to happen for the eu to get involved . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv . despite leaving the shackles of the kremlin 's influence behind following the 1991 collapse of the soviet union , ukraine has yet to find any real peace away from its former master .
the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .
these fears were heightened after medvedev submitted legislation to parliament last week that will give him powers to deploy the military abroad " to defend the interests of russia and its citizens . "
prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .
" there are two schools of thinking in the kremlin over ukraine .
one wants moscow to push for a pro-russia elite in kyiv , one which is open to doing business with russia , one which is loyal and reliable and which will honor and implement deals struck between the two countries . " " the other school would prefer to see yushchenko stay in power as he is seen as incompetent , " he added . " this stimulates chaos and uncertainty in ukraine and makes it vulnerable to russia ’ s wishes .
this also serves the purpose of showing that post-soviet states can ’ t work without russia and that one day , they will have to come under the protection of some russia-led bloc once again . " russia unconcerned with potential european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was silent as medvedev signaled russia 's intensions any interference by russia in january 's presidential election or in its aftermath would bring moscow once again into conflict with europe and the united states .
medvedev is unlikely to lose much sleep over any eu response should the kremlin - one way or another - install its favored candidate in the kyiv hot seat .
the eu , currently hugely dependent on russian gas , imposed no serious penalty on moscow over the war with georgia and recent signs hint that russia will escape just as lightly if it succeeds in undercutting ukraine 's independence .
at their recent meeting chancellor merkel , standing beside medvedev when he so publicly severed ties with ukraine in sochi , remained silent on the issue .
merkel , the head of the eu 's largest country , offered no support for ukraine as a democratic partner , nor defended the right of its people to choose their leaders for themselves , stunning ukrainian officials with her reticence while presumably prompting quiet satisfaction in moscow .
" we are unlikely to see any public challenge to russia from the eu should moscow interfere in ukraine , " said nicu popescu .
" the eu avoids high politics when it can and works below the radar on technical and trade levels ; providing credit , creating stability and promoting reforms .
the eu will keep out of this election whatever happens and certainly wo n't favor any one candidate over another .
something major will have to happen for the eu to get involved . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv . despite leaving the shackles of the kremlin 's influence behind following the 1991 collapse of the soviet union , ukraine has yet to find any real peace away from its former master .
the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .
these fears were heightened after medvedev submitted legislation to parliament last week that will give him powers to deploy the military abroad " to defend the interests of russia and its citizens . "
prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .
" there are two schools of thinking in the kremlin over ukraine .
one wants moscow to push for a pro-russia elite in kyiv , one which is open to doing business with russia , one which is loyal and reliable and which will honor and implement deals struck between the two countries . " " the other school would prefer to see yushchenko stay in power as he is seen as incompetent , " he added . " this stimulates chaos and uncertainty in ukraine and makes it vulnerable to russia ’ s wishes .
this also serves the purpose of showing that post-soviet states can ’ t work without russia and that one day , they will have to come under the protection of some russia-led bloc once again . " russia unconcerned with potential european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was silent as medvedev signaled russia 's intensions any interference by russia in january 's presidential election or in its aftermath would bring moscow once again into conflict with europe and the united states .
medvedev is unlikely to lose much sleep over any eu response should the kremlin - one way or another - install its favored candidate in the kyiv hot seat .
the eu , currently hugely dependent on russian gas , imposed no serious penalty on moscow over the war with georgia and recent signs hint that russia will escape just as lightly if it succeeds in undercutting ukraine 's independence .
at their recent meeting chancellor merkel , standing beside medvedev when he so publicly severed ties with ukraine in sochi , remained silent on the issue .
merkel , the head of the eu 's largest country , offered no support for ukraine as a democratic partner , nor defended the right of its people to choose their leaders for themselves , stunning ukrainian officials with her reticence while presumably prompting quiet satisfaction in moscow .
" we are unlikely to see any public challenge to russia from the eu should moscow interfere in ukraine , " said nicu popescu .
" the eu avoids high politics when it can and works below the radar on technical and trade levels ; providing credit , creating stability and promoting reforms .
the eu will keep out of this election whatever happens and certainly wo n't favor any one candidate over another .
something major will have to happen for the eu to get involved . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow still seems determined to have a say in how things are run in kyiv . despite leaving the shackles of the kremlin 's influence behind following the 1991 collapse of the soviet union , ukraine has yet to find any real peace away from its former master .
the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .
these fears were heightened after medvedev submitted legislation to parliament last week that will give him powers to deploy the military abroad " to defend the interests of russia and its citizens . "
prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .
" there are two schools of thinking in the kremlin over ukraine .
one wants moscow to push for a pro-russia elite in kyiv , one which is open to doing business with russia , one which is loyal and reliable and which will honor and implement deals struck between the two countries . " " the other school would prefer to see yushchenko stay in power as he is seen as incompetent , " he added . " this stimulates chaos and uncertainty in ukraine and makes it vulnerable to russia ’ s wishes .
this also serves the purpose of showing that post-soviet states can ’ t work without russia and that one day , they will have to come under the protection of some russia-led bloc once again . " russia unconcerned with potential european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was silent as medvedev signaled russia 's intensions any interference by russia in january 's presidential election or in its aftermath would bring moscow once again into conflict with europe and the united states .
medvedev is unlikely to lose much sleep over any eu response should the kremlin - one way or another - install its favored candidate in the kyiv hot seat .
the eu , currently hugely dependent on russian gas , imposed no serious penalty on moscow over the war with georgia and recent signs hint that russia will escape just as lightly if it succeeds in undercutting ukraine 's independence .
at their recent meeting chancellor merkel , standing beside medvedev when he so publicly severed ties with ukraine in sochi , remained silent on the issue .
merkel , the head of the eu 's largest country , offered no support for ukraine as a democratic partner , nor defended the right of its people to choose their leaders for themselves , stunning ukrainian officials with her reticence while presumably prompting quiet satisfaction in moscow .
" we are unlikely to see any public challenge to russia from the eu should moscow interfere in ukraine , " said nicu popescu .
" the eu avoids high politics when it can and works below the radar on technical and trade levels ; providing credit , creating stability and promoting reforms .
the eu will keep out of this election whatever happens and certainly wo n't favor any one candidate over another .
something major will have to happen for the eu to get involved . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i choose a strong state , strength and dignity , to put in their place not only our local feudals but also foreign overlords who want to set down how we should live , " said yushchenko during his 25-minute address .
he also added that , " i choose a full-fledged future for our country in the future of a united europe . "
he made no direct reference to russia , but ukraine 's relationship with its northern neighbor has been contentious .
earlier this month , russian president dmitry medvedev accused yushchenko of fostering anti-russian policies and said that he had given up on any improvement in relations between the two countries .
president yushchenko denied the allegations and invited medvedev to visit ukraine for talks .
russian accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas is a point of tension between ukraine and russia in moscow , the russian prosecutor general 's investigative committee alleged that ukrainian troops fought along side georgian troops when russia and georgia fought a brief war last year .
in a statement the investigative committee said that both nationalist irregulars and ukrainian troops fought in the five-day war .
konstantin sadilove , the ukrainian defense ministry spokesman denied that any ukrainian troops had seen any action , but he could not exclude the fact that some ukrainian irregulars may have been involved .
this comes on top of the diplomatic problems that have made relations between the two countries tense .
among the issues that put a strain on the relationiship is ukraine 's bid to seek nato member ship , problems with gas deliveries to the european union that pass through ukraine and kiev 's insistence that russia close its black sea naval base on the crimean peninsula by 2017. av / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talking to dw , prof. wintermantel insists that professors taking money for accepting unfit students are an exception . about 100 teaching staff at german universities are under investigation by prosecutors for allegedly taking bribes from self-styled phd counselling services in return for accepting phd students not up to the job . the president of germany 's university rectors conference , professor margret wintermantel said in an interview with deutsche welle that corrupt acadmics have no place in the profession .
but insists that the problem lies with individuals , insisting that the german system of higher education is safe and sound . dw : professor wintermantel , when have phd counselling services contacted you the last time ? margret wintermantel : never actually .
neither have colleagues that i know personally .
none of them has ever mentioned to me anything of the sort . what is it that is questionable or even illegal about phd counselling agencies ? i think it is very important that a student who wants to get a phd has to deliver their own unique contribution to research .
if students , using these services , can not show that it is their own contribution with their own piece of research , then we have a problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professors at berlin 's free university are among those being investigated for corruption if students have used those services to get a supervisor , but have otherwise put together their work all by themselves , would they still have to worry about losing their phds ? no , they should not worry about that .
again , if they can show that they have carried out their own research then they should not worry about that .
at most universities students have to include a sworn declaration that what they are presenting is exclusively their own work unless stated otherwise .
the requirement to include this declaration is now standard in exam regulations at most german universities .
this is in fact also the result of a recommendation we made back in 1994 . prosecutors in cologne are investigating close to a hundred professors at german universities , and one phd counselling agency has essentially been shut down .
but there are many more out there .
one might be inclined to think this is just the tip of the iceberg … … no , i do n't think so .
and i want to be perfectly clear - i do n't think so at all .
there are a lot of procedures of quality assurance in the universities , especially when it comes to the question of unique contributions to research .
german universities have precise admissions regulations for phd candidates throughout , there is continuous supervision of phd students .
and of course we should not forget that phd theses get published and are being made accessible to the scientific community where they are and remain subject to intense scientific scrutiny .
so , i think , there is no iceberg . yes , there are some people who jump red lights and then this is a case for the authorities .
but by far most of the phd students do good work and their professors do good work in showing them how to do good research .
we have a problem with a few people , but it is not a problem of the system . most of the faculty members now under investigation are contract staff and associate professors , less so full university professors .
is this also a reflection of the precarious financial situation that many teachers find themselves in who are not fully part of the university hierarchy ? no .
our position is that a phd student should be supervised by a full university professor .
associate professors should not have a central role here .
contract professors are entitled to supervise students and that is perfectly ok .
but to say ' i take bribes because i earn so little ' is totally unacceptable . is there a danger that the scandal could undermine the reputation of germany 's higher education system abroad and that in future fewer international students would chose to go for german universities ? if we insist on blowing this out of proportion - maybe .

talking to dw , prof. wintermantel insists that professors taking money for accepting unfit students are an exception . about 100 teaching staff at german universities are under investigation by prosecutors for allegedly taking bribes from self-styled phd counselling services in return for accepting phd students not up to the job . the president of germany 's university rectors conference , professor margret wintermantel said in an interview with deutsche welle that corrupt acadmics have no place in the profession .
but insists that the problem lies with individuals , insisting that the german system of higher education is safe and sound . dw : professor wintermantel , when have phd counselling services contacted you the last time ? margret wintermantel : never actually .
neither have colleagues that i know personally .
none of them has ever mentioned to me anything of the sort . what is it that is questionable or even illegal about phd counselling agencies ? i think it is very important that a student who wants to get a phd has to deliver their own unique contribution to research .
if students , using these services , can not show that it is their own contribution with their own piece of research , then we have a problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professors at berlin 's free university are among those being investigated for corruption if students have used those services to get a supervisor , but have otherwise put together their work all by themselves , would they still have to worry about losing their phds ? no , they should not worry about that .
again , if they can show that they have carried out their own research then they should not worry about that .
at most universities students have to include a sworn declaration that what they are presenting is exclusively their own work unless stated otherwise .
the requirement to include this declaration is now standard in exam regulations at most german universities .
this is in fact also the result of a recommendation we made back in 1994 . prosecutors in cologne are investigating close to a hundred professors at german universities , and one phd counselling agency has essentially been shut down .
but there are many more out there .
one might be inclined to think this is just the tip of the iceberg … … no , i do n't think so .
and i want to be perfectly clear - i do n't think so at all .
there are a lot of procedures of quality assurance in the universities , especially when it comes to the question of unique contributions to research .
german universities have precise admissions regulations for phd candidates throughout , there is continuous supervision of phd students .
and of course we should not forget that phd theses get published and are being made accessible to the scientific community where they are and remain subject to intense scientific scrutiny .
so , i think , there is no iceberg . yes , there are some people who jump red lights and then this is a case for the authorities .
but by far most of the phd students do good work and their professors do good work in showing them how to do good research .
we have a problem with a few people , but it is not a problem of the system . most of the faculty members now under investigation are contract staff and associate professors , less so full university professors .
is this also a reflection of the precarious financial situation that many teachers find themselves in who are not fully part of the university hierarchy ? no .
our position is that a phd student should be supervised by a full university professor .
associate professors should not have a central role here .
contract professors are entitled to supervise students and that is perfectly ok .
but to say ' i take bribes because i earn so little ' is totally unacceptable . is there a danger that the scandal could undermine the reputation of germany 's higher education system abroad and that in future fewer international students would chose to go for german universities ? if we insist on blowing this out of proportion - maybe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 24.08.2009 " professors who jump the red light need to be prosecuted " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professor margret wintermantel has been president of the german rectors ' conference since march 2006 the head of germany 's association of universities defends the country 's higher education system .
talking to dw , prof. wintermantel insists that professors taking money for accepting unfit students are an exception . about 100 teaching staff at german universities are under investigation by prosecutors for allegedly taking bribes from self-styled phd counselling services in return for accepting phd students not up to the job . the president of germany 's university rectors conference , professor margret wintermantel said in an interview with deutsche welle that corrupt acadmics have no place in the profession .
but insists that the problem lies with individuals , insisting that the german system of higher education is safe and sound . dw : professor wintermantel , when have phd counselling services contacted you the last time ? margret wintermantel : never actually .
neither have colleagues that i know personally .
none of them has ever mentioned to me anything of the sort . what is it that is questionable or even illegal about phd counselling agencies ? i think it is very important that a student who wants to get a phd has to deliver their own unique contribution to research .
if students , using these services , can not show that it is their own contribution with their own piece of research , then we have a problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professors at berlin 's free university are among those being investigated for corruption if students have used those services to get a supervisor , but have otherwise put together their work all by themselves , would they still have to worry about losing their phds ? no , they should not worry about that .
again , if they can show that they have carried out their own research then they should not worry about that .
at most universities students have to include a sworn declaration that what they are presenting is exclusively their own work unless stated otherwise .
the requirement to include this declaration is now standard in exam regulations at most german universities .
this is in fact also the result of a recommendation we made back in 1994 . prosecutors in cologne are investigating close to a hundred professors at german universities , and one phd counselling agency has essentially been shut down .
but there are many more out there .
one might be inclined to think this is just the tip of the iceberg … … no , i do n't think so .
and i want to be perfectly clear - i do n't think so at all .
there are a lot of procedures of quality assurance in the universities , especially when it comes to the question of unique contributions to research .
german universities have precise admissions regulations for phd candidates throughout , there is continuous supervision of phd students .
and of course we should not forget that phd theses get published and are being made accessible to the scientific community where they are and remain subject to intense scientific scrutiny .
so , i think , there is no iceberg . yes , there are some people who jump red lights and then this is a case for the authorities .
but by far most of the phd students do good work and their professors do good work in showing them how to do good research .
we have a problem with a few people , but it is not a problem of the system . most of the faculty members now under investigation are contract staff and associate professors , less so full university professors .
is this also a reflection of the precarious financial situation that many teachers find themselves in who are not fully part of the university hierarchy ? no .
our position is that a phd student should be supervised by a full university professor .
associate professors should not have a central role here .
contract professors are entitled to supervise students and that is perfectly ok .
but to say ' i take bribes because i earn so little ' is totally unacceptable . is there a danger that the scandal could undermine the reputation of germany 's higher education system abroad and that in future fewer international students would chose to go for german universities ? if we insist on blowing this out of proportion - maybe .
-lsb- at present -rsb- however our system of higher education , our phds , our degrees all do enjoy world wide recognition . interview : ranty islam editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.08.2009 opinion : gm is happy to keep its opel unit in limbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could bankruptcy be the right thing for opel ?
opel 's future is hanging by a thread , and its bankrupt parent company , us carmaker general motors , seems happy to keep it that way for the time being .
dw 's karl zawadzky comments . no decision is , in fact , a decision .
the future of the ailing car maker opel is still up in the air , threatened by the ongoing german election and the outlook for new difficulties in the company 's fortunes . the german government and the governments of the german three states with opel subsidiaries can clamor as much as they want : opel 's parent company , general motors , continues to drag out the game .
having filed for bankruptcy as quickly as possible , the american car giant 's detroit managers are giving themselves time to decide the future of their european business - and the fate of its german unit . but pressure is building .
some 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.15 billion -rrb- of german tax money that went into saving opel from bankruptcy will be used up by the end of this year .
worse , the government-sponsored " wrecking-premium , " that allowed people to trade clunkers for cash towards a new car , will run out in a few weeks - and that scheme had given a serious boost to opel sales in germany .
that means even more difficult times are ahead for opel , since despite the wrecking premium , opel has continued to post losses in the millions . time for the next choice soon enough , the german government and the affected states will face a choice : let opel declare bankruptcy , or give it another cash injection in the billions . the american parent was reorganized under bankruptcy protection and with the aid of many billions of dollars from washington .
once the largest company in the world , gm now belongs to the us taxpayer .
and now , its managers in detroit are in no hurry to make a decision .
there are even some indications that they wo n't bother to sell their european activities at all - but will instead try to use european taxpayer monies and do the reorganizing job themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky in any case , it certainly looks as if the americans do n't plan to sell gm 's european car business to the preferred german suitor : a consortium made up of canadian-austrian car-parts maker magna , russia 's sberbank , and russian automaker gaz .
maintaining a minority stake in opel would keep general motors ' hand in the european market .
gm sees itself as an international car maker , and wants to maintain a presence in europe .
this is why the management in detroit would prefer it if investment firm rhj , which is taking a majority stake in opel , would take over the company , reorganize it , and sell it back to gm . moreover , its worth bearing in mind that if opel were to leave the gm group permanently , it would be bad news for gm : opel is the company 's center for development of small cars and engines - in other words , the future of general motors . competition from the russians general motors is extremely critical of the russian involvement in the magna consortium .
for the russians , taking over opel would be a milestone on the road to bringing the decaying russian auto industry up to a european level .
meanwhile , general motors itself wants to build and sell cars in russia .
it has no interest in giving the competition a boost in this important market . gm is playing for time , and it is putting pressure on the german government and the states .
at the same time , it is also an attempt to avoid turning this extremely unpopular issue into grist for the electoral mill in the coming parliamentary elections .
in other words , it wo n't be until after the elections that gm will say what will become of opel . the germans could be ramping up the pressure , of course .
gm no longer holds the majority stake in opel ; it is held by five trustees , including two americans and one german , as well as a chairman who wo n't take part in the conflict .
all together that means that even if there was a blockade , there would be no decision .
it would be a sure path to bankruptcy for opel , and perhaps not the worst choice .
in that case , the bankruptcy administrator would simply sell opel to the highest bidder .
and that is not necessarily us parent company gm . karl zawadzky is the head of deutsche welle 's economics bureau . -lrb- jen -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de fearful of job cuts , germany urges gm to decide opel 's fate with the national election only five weeks away , german politicians are stepping up the pressure on general motors to choose a candidate to take over its troubled opel subsidiary .
-lrb- 23.08.2009 -rrb- germany regrets gm 's indecision regarding opel germany 's economics minister said on saturday he regretted that general motors ' board had failed to take a decision on a deal covering its european operations , including ailing german unit opel .

yet there are also concerns that instead of being crushed here , many cars are being illegally shipped to africa . in an effort to stimulate consumer spending , the german government has provided a scrap bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- for two million old cars this year .
on monday , germany announced it would not extend the subsidy , which has proved extremely popular .
many germans jumped at the chance to replace old cars with new ones .
but instead of being crushed here , as planned by the program , many cars end up in africa .
the german police association bund deutscher kriminalbeamter -lrb- bdk -rrb- has been bombarded with press interview requests ever since it estimated earlier this month that since january at least 50,000 cars have been exported illegally , after their owners had been granted the scrap bonus .
for his calculation bdk vice-chairman wilfried albishausen , who spent part of his career fighting organized crime , adapted criteria which are generaly used for estimating drug trafficking .
" the risk of being caught is extremely low , as there is hardly any control , " he told deutsche welle . " when someone is caught , punishment remains minimal .
thirdly there is a market for old cars in africa and eastern europe .
and the german scrap industry is in a bad shape and therefore more willing to ignore the law . "
gottfried hoell , chairman of the association for the german scrap industry , confirms what the police inspector assumes : 80 percent of the 1,400 officially registered scrappers , hoell says , he trusts blindly .
that leaves almost 300 whom he can not trust .
hoell understands the wrongdoers : " when a car scrapper has financial problems because of the bonus - because he is getting too many cars and has to rent extra space for them and at the same time sells less spare parts for old cars because the cars are no longer there - then of course when he gets an attractive offer in such a situation , he will not say no , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars have not ended up being scrapped during a recent visit to a scrap company in central germany , hoell met an interested african on the premises , who was willing to pay up to 2,500 euros for any bonus car .
that story does n't surprise a nigerian shipping agent based in the rhineland .
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , said he exports up to 150 cars a month to west africa .
he is not involved in illegal business himself , he said .
but he hears stories of exporters taking old cars apart before packing them in containers .
once they reach their destination , they are put together again .
business as usual if two million german old cars are shredded , one would expect a lack of used cars .
german used-car dealers confirm that their business this year sank to barely 20 percent of last year 's turnover .
but in an interview with german national radio deutschlandfunk , a dealer in cotonou , west africa 's main harbour of car imports in the republic of benin , said earlier this month he had n't noticed any difference .
the nigerian shipping agent has no problems either .
" from my situation i do n't think anything changed , " he said .
" from the business i have not noticed any change . "
the man exports mainly via antwerp , where belgian custom authorities may pay little attention to the german scrap bonus scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numerous cases of illegal used-car exports have been reported but even in german harbours like hamburg and bremerhaven customs can do little more than check freight papers , said the bdk 's albishausen .
" they just do n't have the capacity to open up every single container .
but when they check , they often find something .
in hamburg alone they detected nearly 50 cases of illegal used-car exports so far this year . "
five billion euros lost if the bottom line is that the german government 's environmental bonus stimulates the export of old cars , the environment may benefit very little .
" with that program five billion euros are going down the drain , " said spokeswoman ulrike fokken of the deutsche umwelthilfe , an environmental organisation in berlin .
" it is an old problem that germany dumps its garbage in africa , " she added .

yet there are also concerns that instead of being crushed here , many cars are being illegally shipped to africa . in an effort to stimulate consumer spending , the german government has provided a scrap bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- for two million old cars this year .
on monday , germany announced it would not extend the subsidy , which has proved extremely popular .
many germans jumped at the chance to replace old cars with new ones .
but instead of being crushed here , as planned by the program , many cars end up in africa .
the german police association bund deutscher kriminalbeamter -lrb- bdk -rrb- has been bombarded with press interview requests ever since it estimated earlier this month that since january at least 50,000 cars have been exported illegally , after their owners had been granted the scrap bonus .
for his calculation bdk vice-chairman wilfried albishausen , who spent part of his career fighting organized crime , adapted criteria which are generaly used for estimating drug trafficking .
" the risk of being caught is extremely low , as there is hardly any control , " he told deutsche welle . " when someone is caught , punishment remains minimal .
thirdly there is a market for old cars in africa and eastern europe .
and the german scrap industry is in a bad shape and therefore more willing to ignore the law . "
gottfried hoell , chairman of the association for the german scrap industry , confirms what the police inspector assumes : 80 percent of the 1,400 officially registered scrappers , hoell says , he trusts blindly .
that leaves almost 300 whom he can not trust .
hoell understands the wrongdoers : " when a car scrapper has financial problems because of the bonus - because he is getting too many cars and has to rent extra space for them and at the same time sells less spare parts for old cars because the cars are no longer there - then of course when he gets an attractive offer in such a situation , he will not say no , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars have not ended up being scrapped during a recent visit to a scrap company in central germany , hoell met an interested african on the premises , who was willing to pay up to 2,500 euros for any bonus car .
that story does n't surprise a nigerian shipping agent based in the rhineland .
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , said he exports up to 150 cars a month to west africa .
he is not involved in illegal business himself , he said .
but he hears stories of exporters taking old cars apart before packing them in containers .
once they reach their destination , they are put together again .
business as usual if two million german old cars are shredded , one would expect a lack of used cars .
german used-car dealers confirm that their business this year sank to barely 20 percent of last year 's turnover .
but in an interview with german national radio deutschlandfunk , a dealer in cotonou , west africa 's main harbour of car imports in the republic of benin , said earlier this month he had n't noticed any difference .
the nigerian shipping agent has no problems either .
" from my situation i do n't think anything changed , " he said .
" from the business i have not noticed any change . "
the man exports mainly via antwerp , where belgian custom authorities may pay little attention to the german scrap bonus scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numerous cases of illegal used-car exports have been reported but even in german harbours like hamburg and bremerhaven customs can do little more than check freight papers , said the bdk 's albishausen .
" they just do n't have the capacity to open up every single container .
but when they check , they often find something .
in hamburg alone they detected nearly 50 cases of illegal used-car exports so far this year . "
five billion euros lost if the bottom line is that the german government 's environmental bonus stimulates the export of old cars , the environment may benefit very little .
" with that program five billion euros are going down the drain , " said spokeswoman ulrike fokken of the deutsche umwelthilfe , an environmental organisation in berlin .
" it is an old problem that germany dumps its garbage in africa , " she added .

but macaskill , who freed abdel basset al-megrahi on compassionate grounds because he is dying of prostate cancer , criticized libya for the celebrations that greeted his return to tripoli .
" a decision had to be made , " macaskill told parliament in edinburgh , the scottish capital .
“ it was based on the law of scotland , and the values i believe we seek to uphold .
it was not based on political , diplomatic or economic considerations . "
" i stand by it and live with the consequences , " macaskill said .
" showing mercy is not a sign of weakness ...
it is a source of pride for many scots and will be accepted by large parts of the international community , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macaskill says showing mercy is not a sign of weakness relatives of us victims have strongly condemned the decision to release 57-year-old megrahi , the only person ever convicted of the 1988 bombing of a pan am jet over the scottish town of lockerbie , killing 270 people , 189 of them americans .
megrahi flew home from scotland on thursday and was greeted in the libyan capital by more than 1,000 people cheering and waving libyan and scottish flags .
" a matter of great regret " macaskill said he had sought a promise from libya that it would handle megrahi 's return in a sensitive way .
" it is a matter of great regret that mr al-megrahi was received in such an inappropriate manner , " he said .
" assurances had been given by the libyan government that any return would be dealt with in a low-key and sensitive fashion . "
the british government has denied wanting megrahi to be freed to bolster diplomatic and commercial ties with libya , which has the biggest oil reserves in africa .
oil giants bp and royal dutch shell have signed big exploration deals with libya .
critics say the british government has allowed the scottish authorities , who have devolved powers and a separate legal system , to take the blame for the release and has chosen not to make its own position clear .
a spokesman for prime minister gordon brown , whose ruling labour party lost to the scottish national party in elections in scotland in 2007 , made no comment on the decision other than to say it was a matter for the devolved scottish government .
us president barack obama said megrahi 's warm welcome in libya was " highly objectionable , ” while fbi director robert mueller wrote to macaskill , saying his actions had made a mockery of the rule of law and " given comfort to terrorists . "
the british government on monday rejected the claim. ch / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 24.08.2009 polish crime writer uncovers wroclaw 's german history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw is - and was - a city full of mystery polish author marek krajewski writes gripping mystery novels that fly off the shelves .
while the star detective solves crimes , the books carefully uncover even greater mysteries about wroclaw 's german history . when crime writer marek krajewski tours poland to meet with his readers , he attracts more fans than nearly any other polish author , which may be because krajewski is not the typical thriller writer . his dark detective novels are very original and feature the feisty , fiercely independent and lecherous inspector eberhardt mock .
krajewski is also a classical scholar with a penchant for latin verse , literary allusions , and above all , a love of the pre-world war ii history of the city of breslau - now called wroclaw - in south-western poland . fascination with the past growing up in wroclaw during the cold war , krajewski was intrigued to find out more about the city whose communist rulers had done their best to erase all traces of the german past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw , on the oder river , was became part of poland in 1945 back in the early 1990s , after communism had fallen and wroclaw 's history was no longer taboo , a large number of photo albums devoted to pre-war architecture were published , said the author .
this piqued his interest in the era . " i practically moved into the wroclaw university library , " he said .
" i love leafing through old books , records , historical monographs and address books .
i read old 1920s and 1930s german newspapers .
this enables me to grasp the flavor of the time . " thanks to his detailed research , krajewski knows , for example , which perfumes his main character ’ s young wife would have used , and which brand of cigarettes inspector mock would have smoked . each story about inspector mock starts out as a straight detective novel , along the lines of agatha christie or conan doyle , but then it drifts off into juicy images of stodgy silesian cuisine , drinking feasts , jewish street markets , and local theater productions . krajewski includes details from the glamorous lifestyle of breslau ’ s rich and famous as well as from the daily lives of the city ’ s lower classes - including plenty of anecdotes about historical breslau inhabitants . city of diversity and integration those who think they have picked up an airport novel end up with question marks about the nature of european identity and the overlay of cultures in a city with shifting populations .
until world war ii , breslau had been a place where german , jews , poles and other minorities lived together in relative peace and tolerance . krajewski " was certainly the first to give this nostalgia a literary shape , bringing the past back , making it more visible and showing the roots , which was not only valuable from the literary point of view , but also culturally acceptable , " said literary critic krzysztof fordonski . the way krajewski structures a literary work out of minute elements of the past is unconventional for polish literature , added fordonski .
" this gives his books credibility which transcends what we normally expect from a detective story . " although a feature film about inspector mock has yet to be shot , several tv dramatizations of the series have already been made .
there is also talk of a major polish-german film co-production that would introduce inspector mock to mainstream european audiences . " krajewski is the first to recreate this world with lots of character , so you are moved back to those times in wroclaw , " said actress edyta bach , who grew up in the city .
" i think wroclaw has some mysteries .
there are lots of places in wroclaw which are not yet discovered . " another taboo to the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books have been translated into german and other languages in his latest novel , " minotaur 's head , " krajewski sets the scene for a debate about post-war mass expulsions , a topic that remains very touchy in poland .
this time , inspector mock investigates a grisly murder case involving rape and cannibalism which takes him from breslau to what was then the eastern polish city of lvov , now known as lviv in western ukraine . breslau is the ukrainian equivalent of lvov : after the war , the germans in breslau were expelled to germany , while the poles in lvov were forced back into poland .
these post-war expulsions , marked by violence , pilfering , and death , are a painful memory that many have preferred to suppress over the past six decades . all the book ’ s characters would have been driven out of their homes .
inspector mock leaves breslau and ends up in the us , while the polish inspector he teams up with in lvov would most likely have been resettled to mock ’ s home town . critic krzysztof fordonski said that by setting his novel in the two cities on the eve of the war , krajewski provides a missing link in central european literature . " i think that by setting his latest book in lviv he broke much more of a taboo because we got used to the fact that the western territories of poland were german until 1945 , " he said .
" but -lrb- he addresses -rrb- the remembrance of the eastern polish territories , giving it a literary shape . " krajewski ’ s books have been translated into a dozen languages , including german , english and hebrew .
a documentary about his work has won this year ’ s polish-german journalists award . author : rafal kiepuszewski -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 24.08.2009 polish crime writer uncovers wroclaw 's german history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw is - and was - a city full of mystery polish author marek krajewski writes gripping mystery novels that fly off the shelves .
while the star detective solves crimes , the books carefully uncover even greater mysteries about wroclaw 's german history . when crime writer marek krajewski tours poland to meet with his readers , he attracts more fans than nearly any other polish author , which may be because krajewski is not the typical thriller writer . his dark detective novels are very original and feature the feisty , fiercely independent and lecherous inspector eberhardt mock .
krajewski is also a classical scholar with a penchant for latin verse , literary allusions , and above all , a love of the pre-world war ii history of the city of breslau - now called wroclaw - in south-western poland . fascination with the past growing up in wroclaw during the cold war , krajewski was intrigued to find out more about the city whose communist rulers had done their best to erase all traces of the german past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw , on the oder river , was became part of poland in 1945 back in the early 1990s , after communism had fallen and wroclaw 's history was no longer taboo , a large number of photo albums devoted to pre-war architecture were published , said the author .
this piqued his interest in the era . " i practically moved into the wroclaw university library , " he said .
" i love leafing through old books , records , historical monographs and address books .
i read old 1920s and 1930s german newspapers .
this enables me to grasp the flavor of the time . " thanks to his detailed research , krajewski knows , for example , which perfumes his main character ’ s young wife would have used , and which brand of cigarettes inspector mock would have smoked . each story about inspector mock starts out as a straight detective novel , along the lines of agatha christie or conan doyle , but then it drifts off into juicy images of stodgy silesian cuisine , drinking feasts , jewish street markets , and local theater productions . krajewski includes details from the glamorous lifestyle of breslau ’ s rich and famous as well as from the daily lives of the city ’ s lower classes - including plenty of anecdotes about historical breslau inhabitants . city of diversity and integration those who think they have picked up an airport novel end up with question marks about the nature of european identity and the overlay of cultures in a city with shifting populations .
until world war ii , breslau had been a place where german , jews , poles and other minorities lived together in relative peace and tolerance . krajewski " was certainly the first to give this nostalgia a literary shape , bringing the past back , making it more visible and showing the roots , which was not only valuable from the literary point of view , but also culturally acceptable , " said literary critic krzysztof fordonski . the way krajewski structures a literary work out of minute elements of the past is unconventional for polish literature , added fordonski .
" this gives his books credibility which transcends what we normally expect from a detective story . " although a feature film about inspector mock has yet to be shot , several tv dramatizations of the series have already been made .
there is also talk of a major polish-german film co-production that would introduce inspector mock to mainstream european audiences . " krajewski is the first to recreate this world with lots of character , so you are moved back to those times in wroclaw , " said actress edyta bach , who grew up in the city .
" i think wroclaw has some mysteries .
there are lots of places in wroclaw which are not yet discovered . " another taboo to the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books have been translated into german and other languages in his latest novel , " minotaur 's head , " krajewski sets the scene for a debate about post-war mass expulsions , a topic that remains very touchy in poland .
this time , inspector mock investigates a grisly murder case involving rape and cannibalism which takes him from breslau to what was then the eastern polish city of lvov , now known as lviv in western ukraine . breslau is the ukrainian equivalent of lvov : after the war , the germans in breslau were expelled to germany , while the poles in lvov were forced back into poland .
these post-war expulsions , marked by violence , pilfering , and death , are a painful memory that many have preferred to suppress over the past six decades . all the book ’ s characters would have been driven out of their homes .
inspector mock leaves breslau and ends up in the us , while the polish inspector he teams up with in lvov would most likely have been resettled to mock ’ s home town . critic krzysztof fordonski said that by setting his novel in the two cities on the eve of the war , krajewski provides a missing link in central european literature . " i think that by setting his latest book in lviv he broke much more of a taboo because we got used to the fact that the western territories of poland were german until 1945 , " he said .
" but -lrb- he addresses -rrb- the remembrance of the eastern polish territories , giving it a literary shape . " krajewski ’ s books have been translated into a dozen languages , including german , english and hebrew .

the cancer develops long after exposure to asbestos but patients usually have a limited life expectancy .
the test developed by a team at oxford university looks at levels of a protein closely linked to the cancer in fluid around the lungs .
a uk lung expert welcomed the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine study . "
a simple test which can exclude the diagnosis without resort to more invasive methods would be welcomed " dr paul beckett , british thoracic society mesothelioma is an invariably fatal tumour found in the surface of the lung .
while relatively rare , it is very difficult to treat because of its location and because it does not seem to respond well to chemotherapy .
the disease has been found in people with no history of exposure to asbestos , but inhaling the dust released by the mineral when it is broken up is known to be a key risk factor .
it has particularly affected tradesmen such as joiners , plumbers and electricians .
because it can take many decades for the disease to develop , experts expect the number of cases in the uk to peak at around 2,200 by 2013 .
laws preventing occupational exposure to asbestos are in place in the developed world .
there are no such restrictions in developing countries , however .
high levels the researchers focused on ways of distinguishing mesothelioma as a cause of pleural effusion , the build-up of fluid in the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs .
there are many causes of this symptom , many of which are benign or linked to other types of cancer but over 90 % of people with mesothelioma have the symptom .
at the moment , doctors carry out pleural fluid cytology - a lab test which looks for cancerous cells .
however the oxford team say this is not a very sensitive test .
team members used pleural fluid samples from over 200 patients who had been referred to a specialist respiratory clinic .
they then looked at levels of the protein meothelin - which is released in high quantities in the pleural fluid of most patients with mesothelioma .
it was found that levels of the protein were almost six times higher in patients with the cancer than in those with secondary lung cancers , and 10 times greater than those with benign conditions .
rapid diagnosis dr helen davies , who worked on the research , said : " this study suggests a way for clinicians to more readily identify cases of mesothelioma from the start . "
she added : " because mesothelioma has a median survival time of 12 months , minimising the number of invasive procedures and tests patients require is crucial to reduce morbidity and the time they need to spend in hospital .
" an earlier diagnosis also allows speedier interventions to relieve symptoms as well as initiation of other treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy if appropriate .
" claims for worker 's compensation may also be instigated once the diagnosis is confirmed . "
dr paul beckett of the british thoracic society said : " a simple test which can exclude the diagnosis without resort to more invasive methods would be welcomed , allowing a more streamlined diagnostic pathway both for those with and without the disease .
" such a pathway would be expected to lead to more rapid diagnosis and therefore treatment and perhaps improve the outlook for this disease , as well as avoiding unnecessary tests in those who do n't have mesothelioma . "
professor stephen spiro , of the british lung foundation , said : " this study is an important step forward , as it could lead to earlier diagnosis and better treatment of mesothelioma which is vital as currently most patients diagnosed with this disease live less than 12 months . "

more planes were due to arrive later monday and tuesday from spain and turkey .
in addition , the eu mobilized two further planes from its european tactical reserve of fire-fighting aircraft -lrb- eufftr -rrb- , said mann .
established to assist eu member states that face major fires , the eufftr makes planes available during the summer in a project costing 3.5 million euros -lrb- $ 5 million -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and eu countries have sent in planes to help put out the flames " they are being financed by the eu and have been leased from july 1 to september 30 , " mann said .
" the idea is to help member states with their own efforts . "
the two eu fire fighting planes are stationed on corsica , putting them close to both france and italy and almost exactly halfway between lisbon and athens , according to the european commission .
the planes have already been dispatched five times this summer ; most recently to battle the fires in portugal a few weeks ago .
residents fight flames alongside firefighters working round the clock , firefighters managed to contain all but six major fires burning across greece .
ongoing fires include those on the islands of evia , skyros and on the ionian island of zakynthos .
" we are making progress in limiting the fires , " said fire brigade chief yiannis kappakis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many residents failed to heed the evacuation warning until the fires were too close blazes were still spreading further to the north of athens near the coastal towns of pikermi , porto germano and nea makri , where rescue crews managed to evacuate a dozen nuns safely from an endangered monastery as fires raced down the hill towards them .
the wildfires , which started in the early hours of saturday , swept through homes , caused massive evacuations of entire towns and destroyed more than 40,000 acres -lrb- 16,190 hectares -rrb- of forest and olives groves .
a state of emergency was in effect for days as reinforcements and military personnel were called in .
many athenians who ignored calls to evacuate their neighborhoods could be seen fighting the flames outside their homes with water hoses and branches .
others , armed with shovels and buckets , worked side by side with firefighters and soldiers throughout the night to battle the fires .
at least half a dozen people were being treated for minor burns and breathing problems , the health ministry said monday .
bildunterschrift : fires have been burning since saturday prime minister criticized over response even as prime minister costas karamanlis toured the fire-affected areas , he faced harsh criticism for the poor handling of the fires .
opposition party leaders and mayors said the response resembled that when fires struck the island of evia and the peloponnese in 2007 , killing more than 80 people .
mayors across the are around athens made frantic calls to greek television stations asking for firefighters to be sent to their communities , insisting their was no central body in place to respond to their requests .
" there are still huge shortages in the firefighting infrastructure which should have been looked after following the fires two years ago , " said aleka papariga , leader of the communist party of greece .
speaking to journalists , government spokesperson evangelos antonaros insisted that the firefighting efforts were well coordinated .
" from the first instance , the presence of firefighters and other rescue operations were present to a large degree . "
officials have not officially said what started the fire , but forest fires have become more frequent in greece in recent summers , due to high temperatures , drought , and also arson , often by land developers. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i choose a strong state , strength and dignity , to put in their place not only our local feudals but also foreign overlords who want to set down how we should live , " said yushchenko during his 25-minute address .
he also added that , " i choose a full-fledged future for our country in the future of a united europe . "
he made no direct reference to russia , but ukraine 's relationship with its northern neighbor has been contentious .
earlier this month , russian president dmitry medvedev accused yushchenko of fostering anti-russian policies and said that he had given up on any improvement in relations between the two countries .
president yushchenko denied the allegations and invited medvedev to visit ukraine for talks .
russian accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas is a point of tension between ukraine and russia in moscow , the russian prosecutor general 's investigative committee alleged that ukrainian troops fought along side georgian troops when russia and georgia fought a brief war last year .

konstantin sadilove , the ukrainian defense ministry spokesman denied that any ukrainian troops had seen any action , but he could not exclude the fact that some ukrainian irregulars may have been involved .

but that has n't necessarily boosted the spd ’ s credibility . germany 's oldest political party , the spd , set out in 1875 to become an advocate of the working class and all underprivileged people in society .
although the party officially rebranded itself as a " party of the people " – and not just the working class – in 1959 , it 's still widely associated with being a defender of social justice and equality .
in postwar germany , the spd was also for a long time the largest party , ruling the country between 1969 and 1982 and then again between 1998 and 2005 .
but since 2005 , it has been stuck in a reluctant grand coalition with the conservatives , and that has seen the party ’ s membership and popularity ratings enter a free fall .
current opinion polls see the social democrats trailing the conservative cdu by a wide margin .
in a desperate race to regain lost ground ahead of the general election , the spd 's candidate for chancellor , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , surprised the media with a headline-grabbing promise incorporated in the party ’ s manifesto .
he announced that the social democrats would create four million new jobs over the next decade , which – if seen against current jobless levels – would mean that the country could boast full employment 10 years from now .
fiscal and environmental policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd hopeful frank-walter steinmeier mingling with coal miners in germany in a bid to lure away voters both from the green and far-left spectrum of the political landscape , the spd in its " plan for germany " says its program to foster energy-saving and environmentally-friendly industries could employ two million people .
another million would be needed in the health system and especially geriatric care as the population ages dramatically .
the remaining one million jobs would emerge in the service and trade sector .
the party has faced massive criticism from other political players who insist that creating four million new jobs is totally unrealistic .
in terms of energy policy , the spd wants to reduce the country 's dependence on oil and get half of its power from renewable sources by 2030 .
its position on nuclear energy remains unchanged .
the social democrats stick to what they agreed while governing with the green party – the complete phase-out of nuclear power , meaning the decommissioning of all remaining nuclear power stations in the country by 2020 .
referring to the current economic crisis and the mounting public debt burden , germany 's spd is categorically opposed to any major tax cuts in the next legislature .
it actually plans to raise the top rate of taxation for big earners to 47 percent from 45 percent of incomes at present .
on the other hand , it promises an income tax bonus of 300 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- for people who do not file a claim for rebates .
this is not a nice social gesture , but rather an attempt to cut red tape .
defender of social justice the spd is hoping to appeal to families by offering to raise the tax break for each child per household by 200 euros .
the party has also presented itself as a passionate fighter for a minimum wage of 7.50 euros per hour across all sectors of the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german trade unionist rallying for a minimum wage it would also extend until 2015 a federal subsidy that aims to ease the transition from work to retirement by offering financial support to workers who go on reduced hours .
the spd also repeats its demand that first degrees at universities and colleges should not be subject to study fees which are currently in place in a number of cdu-governed german states .
foreign policy on the foreign policy front , the spd likes to portray itself as a party that banks on diplomacy rather than military intervention .
the issue of germany 's peacekeeping missions abroad under united nations mandates has led to many a heated debate within both the leadership and the rank and file .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier patrolling in afghanistan 's faizabad region this goes in particular for the german armed forces ' involvement in the nato-led afghanistan mission .
it was senior spd member peter struck who , in his former capacity as the country 's defense minister , claimed that germany 's interests had to be defended at the hindu kush .
many spd members would n't necessarily subscribe to this point of view any longer , as the war against the taliban continues with a numerous setbacks for nato allies .
steinmeier insists , however , that reconstruction in afghanistan remains a top priority and will need to be secured militarily in future .
but he says that german troops will withdraw from afghanistan sometime within the next decade .
the bundeswehr 's involvement there has never had strong backing from the germans , especially now , with the number of dead and wounded soldiers rising and reports of fresh attacks making news on an almost daily basis. hg / dpa / reuters / afp editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talking to dw , prof. wintermantel insists that professors taking money for accepting unfit students are an exception . about 100 teaching staff at german universities are under investigation by prosecutors for allegedly taking bribes from self-styled phd counselling services in return for accepting phd students not up to the job . the president of germany 's university rectors conference , professor margret wintermantel said in an interview with deutsche welle that corrupt acadmics have no place in the profession .
but insists that the problem lies with individuals , insisting that the german system of higher education is safe and sound . dw : professor wintermantel , when have phd counselling services contacted you the last time ? margret wintermantel : never actually .
neither have colleagues that i know personally .
none of them has ever mentioned to me anything of the sort . what is it that is questionable or even illegal about phd counselling agencies ? i think it is very important that a student who wants to get a phd has to deliver their own unique contribution to research .
if students , using these services , can not show that it is their own contribution with their own piece of research , then we have a problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : professors at berlin 's free university are among those being investigated for corruption if students have used those services to get a supervisor , but have otherwise put together their work all by themselves , would they still have to worry about losing their phds ? no , they should not worry about that .
again , if they can show that they have carried out their own research then they should not worry about that .
at most universities students have to include a sworn declaration that what they are presenting is exclusively their own work unless stated otherwise .
the requirement to include this declaration is now standard in exam regulations at most german universities .
this is in fact also the result of a recommendation we made back in 1994 . prosecutors in cologne are investigating close to a hundred professors at german universities , and one phd counselling agency has essentially been shut down .
but there are many more out there .
one might be inclined to think this is just the tip of the iceberg … … no , i do n't think so .
and i want to be perfectly clear - i do n't think so at all .
there are a lot of procedures of quality assurance in the universities , especially when it comes to the question of unique contributions to research .
german universities have precise admissions regulations for phd candidates throughout , there is continuous supervision of phd students .
and of course we should not forget that phd theses get published and are being made accessible to the scientific community where they are and remain subject to intense scientific scrutiny .
so , i think , there is no iceberg . yes , there are some people who jump red lights and then this is a case for the authorities .
but by far most of the phd students do good work and their professors do good work in showing them how to do good research .
we have a problem with a few people , but it is not a problem of the system . most of the faculty members now under investigation are contract staff and associate professors , less so full university professors .
is this also a reflection of the precarious financial situation that many teachers find themselves in who are not fully part of the university hierarchy ? no .
our position is that a phd student should be supervised by a full university professor .
associate professors should not have a central role here .
contract professors are entitled to supervise students and that is perfectly ok .
but to say ' i take bribes because i earn so little ' is totally unacceptable . is there a danger that the scandal could undermine the reputation of germany 's higher education system abroad and that in future fewer international students would chose to go for german universities ? if we insist on blowing this out of proportion - maybe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 24.08.2009 polish crime writer uncovers wroclaw 's german history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw is - and was - a city full of mystery polish author marek krajewski writes gripping mystery novels that fly off the shelves .
while the star detective solves crimes , the books carefully uncover even greater mysteries about wroclaw 's german history . when crime writer marek krajewski tours poland to meet with his readers , he attracts more fans than nearly any other polish author , which may be because krajewski is not the typical thriller writer . his dark detective novels are very original and feature the feisty , fiercely independent and lecherous inspector eberhardt mock .
krajewski is also a classical scholar with a penchant for latin verse , literary allusions , and above all , a love of the pre-world war ii history of the city of breslau - now called wroclaw - in south-western poland . fascination with the past growing up in wroclaw during the cold war , krajewski was intrigued to find out more about the city whose communist rulers had done their best to erase all traces of the german past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wroclaw , on the oder river , was became part of poland in 1945 back in the early 1990s , after communism had fallen and wroclaw 's history was no longer taboo , a large number of photo albums devoted to pre-war architecture were published , said the author .
this piqued his interest in the era . " i practically moved into the wroclaw university library , " he said .
" i love leafing through old books , records , historical monographs and address books .
i read old 1920s and 1930s german newspapers .
this enables me to grasp the flavor of the time . " thanks to his detailed research , krajewski knows , for example , which perfumes his main character ’ s young wife would have used , and which brand of cigarettes inspector mock would have smoked . each story about inspector mock starts out as a straight detective novel , along the lines of agatha christie or conan doyle , but then it drifts off into juicy images of stodgy silesian cuisine , drinking feasts , jewish street markets , and local theater productions . krajewski includes details from the glamorous lifestyle of breslau ’ s rich and famous as well as from the daily lives of the city ’ s lower classes - including plenty of anecdotes about historical breslau inhabitants . city of diversity and integration those who think they have picked up an airport novel end up with question marks about the nature of european identity and the overlay of cultures in a city with shifting populations .
until world war ii , breslau had been a place where german , jews , poles and other minorities lived together in relative peace and tolerance . krajewski " was certainly the first to give this nostalgia a literary shape , bringing the past back , making it more visible and showing the roots , which was not only valuable from the literary point of view , but also culturally acceptable , " said literary critic krzysztof fordonski . the way krajewski structures a literary work out of minute elements of the past is unconventional for polish literature , added fordonski .
" this gives his books credibility which transcends what we normally expect from a detective story . " although a feature film about inspector mock has yet to be shot , several tv dramatizations of the series have already been made .
there is also talk of a major polish-german film co-production that would introduce inspector mock to mainstream european audiences . " krajewski is the first to recreate this world with lots of character , so you are moved back to those times in wroclaw , " said actress edyta bach , who grew up in the city .
" i think wroclaw has some mysteries .
there are lots of places in wroclaw which are not yet discovered . " another taboo to the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the books have been translated into german and other languages in his latest novel , " minotaur 's head , " krajewski sets the scene for a debate about post-war mass expulsions , a topic that remains very touchy in poland .
this time , inspector mock investigates a grisly murder case involving rape and cannibalism which takes him from breslau to what was then the eastern polish city of lvov , now known as lviv in western ukraine . breslau is the ukrainian equivalent of lvov : after the war , the germans in breslau were expelled to germany , while the poles in lvov were forced back into poland .
these post-war expulsions , marked by violence , pilfering , and death , are a painful memory that many have preferred to suppress over the past six decades . all the book ’ s characters would have been driven out of their homes .
inspector mock leaves breslau and ends up in the us , while the polish inspector he teams up with in lvov would most likely have been resettled to mock ’ s home town . critic krzysztof fordonski said that by setting his novel in the two cities on the eve of the war , krajewski provides a missing link in central european literature . " i think that by setting his latest book in lviv he broke much more of a taboo because we got used to the fact that the western territories of poland were german until 1945 , " he said .
" but -lrb- he addresses -rrb- the remembrance of the eastern polish territories , giving it a literary shape . " krajewski ’ s books have been translated into a dozen languages , including german , english and hebrew .

now this opposition faces its first major test . the green party 's electoral program makes for dramatic reading .
it speaks of a minimum wage , raising unemployment benefit and higher taxes for top-earners .
but for many , the credibility of the greens is compromised by their failure to produce these radical policies between 1998 and 2005 , when the party held ministerial positions . despite the conservatism of its time in government , the green party has radical politics in its roots .
the party was founded in 1980 , unifying a whole array of regional movements frustrated by mainstream politics .
until then , environmental issues could comfortably be ignored by mainstream politicians , even though there was wide public disaffection with the government 's environmental policy , in particular its commitment to nuclear power . its alternative agenda and informal style quickly attracted leftist veterans of the 1968 movement .
adopting a phrase coined by one of its founding leaders petra kelly , the greens considered themselves the " anti-party party . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , the sneaker minister this irreverence found iconic expression in 1985 , when joschka fischer , who would later become gerhard schroeder 's foreign minister , was sworn in as the new environment minister of the state of hesse wearing sneakers .
immediately nicknamed the " sneaker minister , " fischer would become the green party 's most talismanic leader . leaning to the left officially , the party is campaigning to enter a " red-green " coalition with the spd , but since the left party has been making ground in state level governments , the greens have shifted their agenda noticeably towards the left .
this strategy is both a reaction to the financial crisis and a chance for the party to distance themselves from the increasingly centrist , faltering spd .
indeed , the green party 's campaign program has been greeted approvingly by left party leader oskar lafontaine . last year , juergen trittin , the greens ' top candidate and gerhard schroeder 's former environment minister , became the first green politician to declare that the party was open to a coalition with the left party at state level .
the declaration met with much consternation within his own party , and revealed the green party 's internal indecision .
in truth , many green voters , traditionally from an upper-middle class demographic , have a conservative temperament , a fact underlined by a recent poll published in news magazine focus , which showed that green voters would prefer angela merkel as chancellor to the spd 's candidate , frank-walter steinmeier .
as the old joke goes , the green party is " the fdp with bicycles . " two recent declarations have made the green party 's hopes of entering government this time round desperately slim .
the first came from trittin , who at the end of july made shutting down germany 's older nuclear power stations a coalition condition .
this made a so-called " jamaica " coalition with the christian democratic union and the free democratic party impossible .
the second came when guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , ruled out a coalition with the spd and the greens .
the greens have thus begun to accept their new role as a party of opposition . economic and environmental issues linked but despite a more social economic policy , the green party 's most uncompromising plans are still those that deal with environment protection .
in power , they would put climate protection into the german constitution , and aim to run the country entirely on renewable energy by 2030 .
programs for building new nuclear power , coal power and underground carbon capture and storage plants would all be scrapped .
they also aim to introduce two million electric cars to germany 's streets by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : green party members demonstrate against nuclear power the greens are trying to convince the electorate that the climate crisis and the financial crisis are corollaries of one another , and that only by tackling the two together will either be solved .
this means giving germany 's industry a complete ecological overhaul , and creating a tax structure for industry that encourages different processes and different products .
in the words of one of their campaign phrases , the aim is to " make the blue collar green . " the labor market , the greens claim , calls for a similar wholesale re-think .
they have devised a plan that they say will create a million new jobs in the next four years , by reducing the incentive to work illegally , and investing in renewable energies , renovating buildings , organic agriculture , healthcare , and social work .
they also hope to address poverty by introducing a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.75 -rrb- , and increasing long-term unemployment benefit to 420 euros a month . education and social policy the green party are also determined to create a further 500,000 study places in germany , despite planning to get rid of tuition fees .
instead , each student is to receive 200 euros from the state , going up to 800 euros for students from lower income earning families .
the greens have also joined the growing pressure to reform germany 's tiered school system , and are calling for all children to be taught together until grade 9 . data protection became a central issue in the last legislature , with scandals about large corporations hacking into employees ' e-mail accounts , and new amendments to the bka law , which give the police greater power to search computers remotely and to store personal data for longer .
the green party is hoping to reverse some of these amendments , and to put personal data under the protection of the constitution . true to its libertarian temperament , the green party is in favor of broadening democracy by extending the right of citizens to force plebiscites on a national , not just a state level .
the greens also want to lower the voting age to 16 and extend voting rights to immigrants . foreign policy the party 's traditional roots in the peace movement of the 1970s and 1980s are still evident in their campaign policies .
they are determined to scrap germany 's compulsory military service -lrb- germany is one of the few remaining nato countries with a conscripted army -rrb- , and to reduce the size of the army generally .
they also want to seize the initiative of us president barack obama 's election to push for better relations with iran and north korea .

the relationship between moscow and kyiv has ebbed and flowed for centuries but tensions have increased in the years following independence when two sovereign and independent nations emerged from the wreckage of the soviet superpower .
since then , the two countries have argued about everything from the price of natural gas to the relationship between kyiv and the united states , and the place of the russian language in a country whose current leadership is seeking to develop ukrainian .
now , on the day ukraine celebrates its freedom , it appears a new dimension has been added to the disintegrating trust and vengeful rhetoric between these two nations .
russia , it seems , has had enough of the constant bickering and wants to instigate a change in ukraine , one which will play in its favor .
russian president dmitry medvedev effectively broke off relations with ukraine 's pro-western leadership last week and in the process signaled the kremlin 's intention to meddle in ukraine 's presidential elections to secure victory for the candidate most favorable to russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wo n't do business with yushchenko " i do not see any prospects for re-establishing normal relations under the current political leadership , " medvedev declared after a recent meeting with german chancellor angela merkel at his black sea retreat in sochi .
" i hope ukraine 's new leadership will have many chances of considerably improving relations ... this is a top foreign policy priority for us . "
russia 's favored candidate is viktor yanukovych , the former prime minister defeated in the 2004 election which russia attempted to rig , a hamfisted operation which led to the now famous pro-west " orange revolution . "
that experience is unlikely to stop russia exerting its influence again .
" russia will try to influence the vote in a number of ways , " nicu popescu , a russian-eurasia expert at the european center for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" as with elections in other former soviet states , there will be meetings with various candidates which will show moscow ’ s preferences and maybe at these meetings deals will be made . "
" we may also see the influence of the russian media which has a wide reach in ukraine , especially in the east .
in terms of action , we may see a new gas crisis which will try and undermine the current government and perhaps some event in the crimea which will be aimed at mobilizing the more patriotic russian voters there , " he said . no normal relations with current leadership , says medvedev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko was accused of being " anti-russian " days before breaking off relations , medvedev had denounced ukraine 's leader , president yushchenko , the man at the center of many of the russian-ukrainian disputes in recent years , as anti-russian in an open letter setting out a long list of grievances . these included his " stubborn " pursuit of nato membership , support for georgia in the war over south ossetia , and " incessant " interference with russia 's black sea fleet based at ukraine 's crimean port of sevastopol .
medvedev added that his country could not have normal relations with ukraine unless there was a leadership change in kyiv .
yushchenko stated that he was " very disappointed by the openly unfriendly " comments and a top aide blasted russia 's " imperialist complex . " london 's times newspaper reported that medvedev accompanied his letter with a video blog shot against the backdrop of the black sea with what looked suspiciously like a russian warship anchored offshore . while most of the focus in recent years has been on the annual gas disputes between the two countries , a gathering storm is developing over sevastopol .
the russian fleet is required to leave ukraine by 2017 but russia does not want to go . " moscow naively believes that it has the leverage to influence the ukrainian presidential election campaign , " said alexander rahr , a russia expert at the german society for foreign affairs -lrb- dgap -rrb- .
" this belief comes from nationalist powers in russia who demand to keep the navy base of the russian black see fleet in sevastopol beyond 2017 when the agreement for stationing the fleet in the crimea runs out . " crimea hot-spot raises fears of georgia-style scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian power is often on show in sevastopol crimea is a particularly sensitive area , as many russians regard it as historically their territory and many of crimea 's residents are sympathetic to moscow .
sources in kyiv have expressed concerns that the kremlin could play the crimean card in the coming presidential election or soon after to destabilize any regime considered insufficiently pro-russian .
some even profess a fear that russia , which showed its readiness to use force in georgia last year , has now turned its attention to ukraine and that a georgian-style scenario , in which troops invade to " protect " russian citizens , can not be ruled out .
these fears were heightened after medvedev submitted legislation to parliament last week that will give him powers to deploy the military abroad " to defend the interests of russia and its citizens . "
prime minister yulia tymoshenko , a presidential candidate herself , responded to medvedev 's letter by saying ukraine would not tolerate outside " interference " in its affairs .
" ukraine will determine its foreign and domestic policies independently , with no outside interference , " tymoshenko said in a statement released by her press office .
" we are ready to listen to the opinions of our partners in the east and in the west , to take account of their interests .
but interference in our domestic affairs is unacceptable , " she said .
on the surface , it may seem obvious why russia wants a pro-moscow goverment in power in kyiv but nicu popescu believes its more complicated than just wanting a friendly leader next door .
" it ’ s really not clear what russia wants , " he said .
" there are two schools of thinking in the kremlin over ukraine .
one wants moscow to push for a pro-russia elite in kyiv , one which is open to doing business with russia , one which is loyal and reliable and which will honor and implement deals struck between the two countries . " " the other school would prefer to see yushchenko stay in power as he is seen as incompetent , " he added . " this stimulates chaos and uncertainty in ukraine and makes it vulnerable to russia ’ s wishes .
this also serves the purpose of showing that post-soviet states can ’ t work without russia and that one day , they will have to come under the protection of some russia-led bloc once again . " russia unconcerned with potential european reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was silent as medvedev signaled russia 's intensions any interference by russia in january 's presidential election or in its aftermath would bring moscow once again into conflict with europe and the united states .
medvedev is unlikely to lose much sleep over any eu response should the kremlin - one way or another - install its favored candidate in the kyiv hot seat .
the eu , currently hugely dependent on russian gas , imposed no serious penalty on moscow over the war with georgia and recent signs hint that russia will escape just as lightly if it succeeds in undercutting ukraine 's independence .
at their recent meeting chancellor merkel , standing beside medvedev when he so publicly severed ties with ukraine in sochi , remained silent on the issue .
merkel , the head of the eu 's largest country , offered no support for ukraine as a democratic partner , nor defended the right of its people to choose their leaders for themselves , stunning ukrainian officials with her reticence while presumably prompting quiet satisfaction in moscow .
" we are unlikely to see any public challenge to russia from the eu should moscow interfere in ukraine , " said nicu popescu .
" the eu avoids high politics when it can and works below the radar on technical and trade levels ; providing credit , creating stability and promoting reforms .
the eu will keep out of this election whatever happens and certainly wo n't favor any one candidate over another .
something major will have to happen for the eu to get involved . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 24.08.2009 germany 's car scrapping scheme may have backfired großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's car-scrapping bonus has had unwanted side-effects the german government has decided not to renew its car scrapping scheme , citing costs .
yet there are also concerns that instead of being crushed here , many cars are being illegally shipped to africa . in an effort to stimulate consumer spending , the german government has provided a scrap bonus of 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- for two million old cars this year .
on monday , germany announced it would not extend the subsidy , which has proved extremely popular .
many germans jumped at the chance to replace old cars with new ones .
but instead of being crushed here , as planned by the program , many cars end up in africa .
the german police association bund deutscher kriminalbeamter -lrb- bdk -rrb- has been bombarded with press interview requests ever since it estimated earlier this month that since january at least 50,000 cars have been exported illegally , after their owners had been granted the scrap bonus .
for his calculation bdk vice-chairman wilfried albishausen , who spent part of his career fighting organized crime , adapted criteria which are generaly used for estimating drug trafficking .
" the risk of being caught is extremely low , as there is hardly any control , " he told deutsche welle . " when someone is caught , punishment remains minimal .
thirdly there is a market for old cars in africa and eastern europe .
and the german scrap industry is in a bad shape and therefore more willing to ignore the law . "
gottfried hoell , chairman of the association for the german scrap industry , confirms what the police inspector assumes : 80 percent of the 1,400 officially registered scrappers , hoell says , he trusts blindly .
that leaves almost 300 whom he can not trust .
hoell understands the wrongdoers : " when a car scrapper has financial problems because of the bonus - because he is getting too many cars and has to rent extra space for them and at the same time sells less spare parts for old cars because the cars are no longer there - then of course when he gets an attractive offer in such a situation , he will not say no , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of cars have not ended up being scrapped during a recent visit to a scrap company in central germany , hoell met an interested african on the premises , who was willing to pay up to 2,500 euros for any bonus car .
that story does n't surprise a nigerian shipping agent based in the rhineland .
the man , who asked to remain anonymous , said he exports up to 150 cars a month to west africa .
he is not involved in illegal business himself , he said .
but he hears stories of exporters taking old cars apart before packing them in containers .
once they reach their destination , they are put together again .
business as usual if two million german old cars are shredded , one would expect a lack of used cars .
german used-car dealers confirm that their business this year sank to barely 20 percent of last year 's turnover .
but in an interview with german national radio deutschlandfunk , a dealer in cotonou , west africa 's main harbour of car imports in the republic of benin , said earlier this month he had n't noticed any difference .
the nigerian shipping agent has no problems either .
" from my situation i do n't think anything changed , " he said .
" from the business i have not noticed any change . "
the man exports mainly via antwerp , where belgian custom authorities may pay little attention to the german scrap bonus scheme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : numerous cases of illegal used-car exports have been reported but even in german harbours like hamburg and bremerhaven customs can do little more than check freight papers , said the bdk 's albishausen .
" they just do n't have the capacity to open up every single container .
but when they check , they often find something .
in hamburg alone they detected nearly 50 cases of illegal used-car exports so far this year . "
five billion euros lost if the bottom line is that the german government 's environmental bonus stimulates the export of old cars , the environment may benefit very little .
" with that program five billion euros are going down the drain , " said spokeswoman ulrike fokken of the deutsche umwelthilfe , an environmental organisation in berlin .
" it is an old problem that germany dumps its garbage in africa , " she added .
scrapper gottfried höll laughs off the environmental justification , even for those cars that are demolished in germany in line with the scheme .
before they are crushed all the parts can be removed , including the old engine , to live a second life in europe .
or elsewhere .

as its name suggests , the cdu is christian-based but aims to appeal to broad cross-section of society .
anyone may join the party , which has pursued a neo-liberal since helmut kohl 's time as germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 .
the party 's 2009 election slogan , " we have the strength , " is an attempt to position chancellor angela merkel as the only politician able to drag germany out of the economic crisis .
" we have the power to make germany stronger than it was before the crisis , " merkel said when presenting her election program to the public in june .
fiscal policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's conservatives want to cut taxes to overcome economic crisis germany 's two conservative parties strongly reject tax increases to finance current measures to stabilize financial markets and stimulate economic growth .
instead they aim to boost domestic consumption with a two-step cut in the lowest income tax bracket , from 14 to 12 percent .
they also want to raise the threshold above which income is taxed at the highest rate of 42 percent to 60,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,600 -rrb- from 52,552 euros .
the cdu / csu call for reforms to limit the impact of " cold progression " - the process by which taxpayers are shifted into higher tax brackets thus reducing their real income after a pay raise .
the conservatives also say they will examine corporate taxes to ensure they do not over-burden firms .
however , the envisaged tax measures are dependent on the next government 's financial room to maneuver .
in labor market policy , the two conservative parties are strictly against the introduction of a nationwide minimum wage , arguing that wage policy must remain an issue of collective bargaining between labor and business .
reforming international financial markets merkel 's conservatives blame lax oversight on the part of banks and international financial markets for the current financial crisis .
they say the european union 's stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro , must be strengthened , and they reject attempts to exert political influence over the european central bank .
they also press for stronger supervision of the banking sector , including an international code of conduct for hedge funds and ratings agencies .
social and education policies move center stage a strong emphasis on education and social policy marks a change from the conservative 's 2005 election program .
at the time , the social democrats won many votes by accusing merkel of being unsympathetic towards those in need in germany .
the cdu / csu want to increase government subsidies for families with children .

but if recent state level success continues , the left party will become difficult to ignore . a glance at the left party 's website shows where its priorities and its ambitions lie .
" the left party is entering these elections aspiring to take part in the formation of governments , and it is prepared to lead these governments , " the homepage reads .
though it was founded in 2005 under the name electoral alternative for labor and social justice , the left party has apparently shed its oppositional position and is beginning to feel strong enough to test its socialist agenda in government . despite ostensible successes at a regional level and a clear national profile in the media , the left party is still regarded as political poison by its rivals in the west of the country – any hint that a politician might harbor fantasies of a coalition with the left generally ignites a round of indignation .
the left 's position as the direct successors of the party of democratic socialism and by extension the ruling party of former east germany , the sed , is still a stigma . problematic past part of this reputation is down to the controversial past of gregor gysi , co-chairman of the left 's parliamentary group .
a member of the sed since 1967 , gysi rose to prominence around the time of germany 's reunification , playing an instrumental part in the internal re-organization of the sed and its reinvention as the pds , of which he became the first party chairman .
his charisma and rhetorical gift made him an important leader of the left party , but his record has been stained recently by accusations that he was an informant for the east german secret police , the stasi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi has been both a popular and shadowy element in the left 's leadership after steadily improving election results throughout the 1990s , the pds / left party managed to enter coalition governments , or support spd-led minority governments , in a few states in the former east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
much of its success in the west depends on oskar lafontaine , the high-profile spd defector whose pugnacious media presence has given the party its recent national profile . social and economic policy lafontaine 's statements , such as " we want to overthrow capitalism , " in an interview with der spiegel in may 2009 , frequently give the impression that the party deliberately fosters this provocative anti-establishment image .
but its policies , though radical , are not anti-democratic . central to its economic policy is a keynesian use of state intervention to balance market forces .
in the current election program , this includes socializing the entire banking system , outlawing non-transparent financial products , hedge funds , and venture capitalism , and restricting currency markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reversing schroeder 's social welfare reforms has been a unifying cause in the left party on a social level , the left 's economic plan would mean the introduction of a minimum hourly wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14.30 -rrb- , raising top-rate income tax from 42 percent to 53 percent , and scrapping the hartz iv unemployment benefit reforms introduced under gerhard schroeder 's government .
as a stop-gap during this transition , the left would raise long-term unemployment benefit , currently at 345 euros a month , to 500 euros , raise child benefit to 200 euros a month , and introduce a minimum pension of 800 euros . there would be a similar spending spree in education .
the left would not only ditch university tuition fees , but would redirect a full 7 percent of germany 's gross domestic product into education .
the three-tier , ability-based school system would also be abandoned in favor of a universal school until 10th grade . energy goals the left also has a decidedly green agenda on the environment , seeing fossil fuels and nuclear energy as relics of the 20th century .
like the green party , it hopes to switch germany onto renewable energies , though with a slightly more conservative timeframe than the greens , eventually lowering germany 's greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent by 2050 . but the left party takes a harder line on nuclear power , for which it believes the safety risks are unacceptable .
if in power , the party would demand that all nuclear power plants be shut down as soon as possible , and would introduce a ban on exporting nuclear technology . foreign and security policy on foreign policy and security issues , the left party is equally uncompromising .
it demands an immediate withdrawal of the german army from afghanistan , and in fact would end all german army missions abroad .
on top of this , the left party would like to see nato replaced by a collective security organization with russia as a member . in the question of internal security , the left party perhaps belies its roots in the dictatorial gdr .
in power , it would end the new anti-terrorist powers granted to the police , for example , banning remote online searches and the storage of personal data .
it would also ban the far-right national democratic party , lower the voting age to 16 , and introduce voting rights for immigrants . author : ben knight editor : deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cancer develops long after exposure to asbestos but patients usually have a limited life expectancy .
the test developed by a team at oxford university looks at levels of a protein closely linked to the cancer in fluid around the lungs .
a uk lung expert welcomed the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine study .
a simple test which can exclude the diagnosis without resort to more invasive methods would be welcomed dr paul beckett , british thoracic society mesothelioma is an invariably fatal tumour found in the surface of the lung .
while relatively rare , it is very difficult to treat because of its location and because it does not seem to respond well to chemotherapy .
the disease has been found in people with no history of exposure to asbestos , but inhaling the dust released by the mineral when it is broken up is known to be a key risk factor .
it has particularly affected tradesmen such as joiners , plumbers and electricians .
because it can take many decades for the disease to develop , experts expect the number of cases in the uk to peak at around 2,200 by 2013 .
laws preventing occupational exposure to asbestos are in place in the developed world .
there are no such restrictions in developing countries , however .
high levels the researchers focused on ways of distinguishing mesothelioma as a cause of pleural effusion , the build-up of fluid in the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs .
there are many causes of this symptom , many of which are benign or linked to other types of cancer but over 90 % of people with mesothelioma have the symptom .
at the moment , doctors carry out pleural fluid cytology - a lab test which looks for cancerous cells .
however the oxford team say this is not a very sensitive test .
team members used pleural fluid samples from over 200 patients who had been referred to a specialist respiratory clinic .
they then looked at levels of the protein meothelin - which is released in high quantities in the pleural fluid of most patients with mesothelioma .
it was found that levels of the protein were almost six times higher in patients with the cancer than in those with secondary lung cancers , and 10 times greater than those with benign conditions .
rapid diagnosis dr helen davies , who worked on the research , said : " this study suggests a way for clinicians to more readily identify cases of mesothelioma from the start . "
she added : " because mesothelioma has a median survival time of 12 months , minimising the number of invasive procedures and tests patients require is crucial to reduce morbidity and the time they need to spend in hospital .
" an earlier diagnosis also allows speedier interventions to relieve symptoms as well as initiation of other treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy if appropriate .
" claims for worker 's compensation may also be instigated once the diagnosis is confirmed . "
dr paul beckett of the british thoracic society said : " a simple test which can exclude the diagnosis without resort to more invasive methods would be welcomed , allowing a more streamlined diagnostic pathway both for those with and without the disease .
" such a pathway would be expected to lead to more rapid diagnosis and therefore treatment and perhaps improve the outlook for this disease , as well as avoiding unnecessary tests in those who do n't have mesothelioma . "
professor stephen spiro , of the british lung foundation , said : " this study is an important step forward , as it could lead to earlier diagnosis and better treatment of mesothelioma which is vital as currently most patients diagnosed with this disease live less than 12 months . "

the cancer develops long after exposure to asbestos but patients usually have a limited life expectancy .
the test developed by a team at oxford university looks at levels of a protein closely linked to the cancer in fluid around the lungs .
a uk lung expert welcomed the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine study .
a simple test which can exclude the diagnosis without resort to more invasive methods would be welcomed dr paul beckett , british thoracic society mesothelioma is an invariably fatal tumour found in the surface of the lung .
while relatively rare , it is very difficult to treat because of its location and because it does not seem to respond well to chemotherapy .
the disease has been found in people with no history of exposure to asbestos , but inhaling the dust released by the mineral when it is broken up is known to be a key risk factor .
it has particularly affected tradesmen such as joiners , plumbers and electricians .
because it can take many decades for the disease to develop , experts expect the number of cases in the uk to peak at around 2,200 by 2013 .
laws preventing occupational exposure to asbestos are in place in the developed world .
there are no such restrictions in developing countries , however .
high levels the researchers focused on ways of distinguishing mesothelioma as a cause of pleural effusion , the build-up of fluid in the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs .
there are many causes of this symptom , many of which are benign or linked to other types of cancer but over 90 % of people with mesothelioma have the symptom .
at the moment , doctors carry out pleural fluid cytology - a lab test which looks for cancerous cells .
however the oxford team say this is not a very sensitive test .
team members used pleural fluid samples from over 200 patients who had been referred to a specialist respiratory clinic .
they then looked at levels of the protein meothelin - which is released in high quantities in the pleural fluid of most patients with mesothelioma .
it was found that levels of the protein were almost six times higher in patients with the cancer than in those with secondary lung cancers , and 10 times greater than those with benign conditions .
rapid diagnosis dr helen davies , who worked on the research , said : " this study suggests a way for clinicians to more readily identify cases of mesothelioma from the start . "
she added : " because mesothelioma has a median survival time of 12 months , minimising the number of invasive procedures and tests patients require is crucial to reduce morbidity and the time they need to spend in hospital .
" an earlier diagnosis also allows speedier interventions to relieve symptoms as well as initiation of other treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy if appropriate .
" claims for worker 's compensation may also be instigated once the diagnosis is confirmed . "
dr paul beckett of the british thoracic society said : " a simple test which can exclude the diagnosis without resort to more invasive methods would be welcomed , allowing a more streamlined diagnostic pathway both for those with and without the disease .
" such a pathway would be expected to lead to more rapid diagnosis and therefore treatment and perhaps improve the outlook for this disease , as well as avoiding unnecessary tests in those who do n't have mesothelioma . "
professor stephen spiro , of the british lung foundation , said : " this study is an important step forward , as it could lead to earlier diagnosis and better treatment of mesothelioma which is vital as currently most patients diagnosed with this disease live less than 12 months . "

deputy first minister ieuan wyn jones axed the planned £ 1bn route in july , saying its estimated costs had soared .
but the conservatives said the millions spent showed the previous commitment to the scheme and it was now a " waste " .
the assembly government said much of the feasibility work could be used in alternative schemes planned for the m4 .
mr jones , who also holds the transport portfolio , announced the proposed 14 mile -lrb- 22.5km -rrb- road from magor to castleton in september 2007 , saying it could open in 2013 .
the announcement was against the background of two fatal crashes in previous months which caused gridlock to the south wales corridor , prompting business leaders to say traffic congestion was hitting the area 's economy .
but in july this year , the proposed m4 relief road was dropped from the assembly government 's five-year transport plan . "
it is clear that even as recently as last year the assembly government was committed to its development and was spending millions on turning it into a reality " william graham am the figures obtained by south east wales am william graham showed £ 15.5m was spent on the design development of the magor to castleton route between 1998 and 2008 , with around half of that in the previous two years .
of the £ 8.4m spent in the previous two years , nearly £ 700,000 went on surveys and £ 7.1m to technical advisers .
mr graham said : " the proposed m4 relief road was one of two major strategic requirements for the transport network in south east wales .
' wasted ' " it is clear that even as recently as last year the assembly government was committed to its development and was spending millions on turning it into a reality .
" while we accept that major projects such as this inevitably require careful planning over a number of years £ 15m has effectively been wasted by the assembly government 's decision to abandon it . "
he called on mr jones to say whether his decision was taken in the weeks or months before july this year .
mr graham added : " or was he being advised to scrap it last year , at the same time as spending on its development was higher than all but one of the previous 10 years ? "

the men considering a bid for the newspapers are understood to be martin gilbert , chief executive of aberdeen asset management and chairman of first group ; ben thomson , chairman of the noble group finance house and of the reform scotland think tank ; and mark shaw , chief executive of hazeldene group property developers , who was one of those who backed a legal challenge to the lloyds tsb 's takeover of halifax bank of scotland .

but with advertising having seen a sharp decline and readers abandoning newspapers in favour of free online news , the whole sector is in crisis .
if johnston is forced to sell the scotsman group , it faces a major loss on the £ 160m it paid for it in 2005 , with speculation that the consortium values the asset around £ 40m .
