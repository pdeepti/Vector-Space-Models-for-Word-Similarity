the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .
a fourth defendant , pavel ryaguzov , a secret police agent , was acquitted in a separate trial for allegedly providing the killer with politkovskaya 's address . despite lasting almost four months , the original trial failed to shed any significant light on the circumstances of the killing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the original four suspects was the killer the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on october 7 , 2006 , has not been apprehended .
rights groups have long criticized russia 's failure to bring to justice the person , or persons , responsible for the death of politkovskaya .
the new supreme court ruling means the verdict of the moscow district military court has been annulled and the criminal case referred back to the same court for a new hearing .
lawyers for the politkovskaya family said they did not agree with the case being thrown out , or with the order for a retrial , because the men charged had not been the real perpetrators of the crime .
" i think there should not be a repeat trial .
the case should be sent by the court for additional investigation , " politkovskaya 's son ilya said .
politkovskaya , who had been an award-winning investigative journalist for the novaya gazeta newspaper , wrote dozens of articles on human rights abuses in russia and published a book called " putin 's russia . "
in that book , she accused the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , of using the chechen conflict to strangle democracy , while detailing horrific rights abuses in chechnya .
her murder triggered an outcry in the international community and raised serious concerns about a surge in crackdowns against people critical of the kremlin and putin. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italian foreign minister franco frattini said iran was " at a turning point " following the post-election street clashes , in which at least 17 people have been killed .
' ' it must choose whether or not to keep the door open to dialogue with the international community , " he said .
" the hand extended by the united states , which we have supported , can not come back with blood on it , " frattini said .
' ' we will adopt a particularly tough and clear position . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too said he expected foreign ministers from the industrialized nations of the group of eight to take a common line on the violence in iran .
russia against isolating iran but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that isolating iran would be the " wrong approach " for the g8 .
after a meeting with frattini , lavrov said " no-one " wanted to condemn tehran . rome had originally invited iran to attend the three-day gathering , arguing that tehran could have an important role to play in stabilizing afghanistan - a key focus of the meeting .
but rome retracted the invitation after tehran failed to respond and after days of violent clashes with demonstrators protesting iran 's disputed june 12 elections .
" i think it 's a missed opportunity for the iranian government , " european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said .
she condemned " the excessive use of force by the security forces against any peaceful demonstrators . "
unrest in tehran continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians protest against the disputed election results at a rally in paris millions of iranians accuse the government of fraud in the june 12 election which gave president mahmoud ahmadinejad an verwhelming landslide victory , prompting protest demonstrations in which at least 17 people were killed .
in another development on thursday , iranian state media said that eight members of the pro-government basij militia had been killed and dozens more wounded in the protests .
the eight deaths were in addition to 17 other people whose deaths have already been reported .
the figures can not be verified due to severe reporting restrictions inside iran .
meeting to focus on afghanistan-pakistan border unrest another topic at the talks in trieste on friday would be developments in afghanistan and pakistan , whose foreign ministers will both be present .
germany launched the " afpak " regional cooperation programme during its g8 presidency two years ago .
berlin now expects this dialogue to enable significant cooperation between the two countries in combating terrorism .
germany has also committed 90 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- in aid to the border region between afghanistan and pakistan .
taliban militants have stepped up their attacks as fears grow that islamist extremists are exacting revenge for a six-week military offensive against them in three northwest districts .
taliban-linked attacks have killed around 2,000 people in pakistan since july 2007 .
the eu said that it would call for international support for pakistan 's efforts against taliban-led extremists but also an " integrated long-term strategy , which includes social economic development , civilian law-enforcement structures and the rule of law , in order to secure the gains of the present counter-insurgency operations on a permanent basis . "
" in contrast to us military power , the eu has been concentrating on the civilian aspect ; a soft power surge , " said shada islam , head of the asia program at the european policy center in brussels .
" this is done through a ' hearts and minds ' approach , using development aid and the promotion of a more balanced counter insurgency policy . "
according to daniel korski , a senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , the eu 's involvement in other aspects of the counter-insurgency mission has proved to be as important as any military investment .
more help needed for swat valley residents the fighting in the swat valley and northern provinces has taken a huge toll on the people of the region with un figures suggesting as many as 2.5 million pakistanis have been displaced by the conflict .
g8 leaders are expected to provide additional financial assistance to help the refugees on top of the 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- the eu pledged in may .
bildunterschrift : the inhabitants of swat valley are now housed in refugee camps " the eu was fast in reacting to the crisis but much more urgently needs to be done and it has recognized that , " shada islam said .
" what the eu needs to do , apart from increasing its aid , is be very visible in the refugee camps and show its support .
the religious groups fighting the government are already in these camps and if there is a sign that the west 's help is slow , they will strengthen their grip . "
" also , as is the case in asia , refugees are being taken in by family members which puts families under immense strain .
the eu can provide financial assistance to these families .
public opinion is in favor of this offensive and it 's very important to get aid to the refugees quickly to keep this support going . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.06.2009 birth control pill for men could be available soon , says who großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contraceptive reduces sperm count by up to 100 percent , say researchers women have been awaiting it for years , and , according to researchers , it looks like the pill for men is finally in sight .
the other good news is that is does n't seem to have any side-effects . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is currently testing a hormonal birth control pill for men .
michael zitzman , who is heading the study , told deutsche welle that it will likely be available to the public in 2012 at the earliest . deutsche welle : mr. zitzman , would you take the pill for men yourself ? prof. michael zitzman : yes , of course . why is everyone making such a big deal about this pill for men when it is n't even a pill ? it 's kind of like a product name , because the pill for women is so well known .
there 's never been an oral pill for men that can bring the same result as it does for women .
men have had to use shots , implants , and gels that are applied on the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael zitzmann heads the who study so how does the pill for men actually work ? with this hormonal form of contraception for men , natural testosterone is applied together with gestagen , which is a precursor of testosterone .
the goal is to completely suppress the hormones that stimulate the production of sperm in the testicles . how much testosterone and gestagen is needed ? the patient takes the dose that used for men who 've had a testicular disease , for example , and need to take replacement hormones .
they have to take extra testosterone to avoid side-effects like depression , osteoporoses or anaemia . is there a recommended dose ? 1,000 milligrams .
that 's about 1 gram of testosterone every two months . you 've said that sperm production is reduced by up to 100 percent .
but that 's not irreversible , is it ? no , of course not .
if that were the case then you might as well just have a vasectomy .
this method is completely reversible - that 's been the case with all the men tested .
it takes about four months , or sometimes only two , for the sperm to build up again . it takes the same amount of time for the sperm to disappear , since they go through a maturing process in the testicles .
once this process has begun , then their independent of the hormones .
that means that the sperm continue to develop without any hormones .
in the study , we noticed that after 4 weeks the sperm had disappeared in some of the men .
it usually takes two to four months , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pill will not affect appearance , say researchers does the additional testosterone change the man 's body in any way ?
testosterone is usually associated with muscles , body builders , and doping . it depends on dose of the hormone .
when a healthy man is given the same dose of testosterone that he would normally produce , then his body automatically reduces its own production of the hormone and the sperm count drops .
that means that his hormone levels do n't change and neither do his appearance or health . how far along is this study ?
the idea of a birth control pill for men has been around for a while now , and there have been lots of research projects … it has been around for a while .
the first thing we had to do was to figure out how everything works .
how well does it work and what are the side effects ?
the side effects that had been reported came from studies where placebos were used , which means some of the men received fake medication . the side-effects all resulted from placebo-niveau .
some of the men felt poorly or had trouble sleeping , but that probably had nothing to do with the actual medication .
it might have just been a side-effect of knowing they were taking part in a study , or it could also have just been a coincidence . so there are no side effects ? the only side-effect is that the testicles shrink a bit , because they stop working .
however , they return to their normal size when the men stop taking the pill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers do n't know if the pill for men appeals to couples when can we expect to see the birth control pill for men on the market ? that depends on how the pharmaceutical industry sees it and whether the world health organization receives a license .
i think that the study by the world health organization will be successful since we already know from past studies that it works . what we still need to find out is what couples think of this method .
do they feel good about it ?
i ca n't answer that just yet , because we still need to find the answer to that .
we think that , if everything goes well , the pill could be on the market as early as 2012 or 2013 . is the pharmaceutical industry interested ? yes , because the substances that are needed for the pill are already on the market .
they 've been permitted for other uses and the authorities would just have to approve them for the pill for men .
then the industry could put it on the market relatively quickly . interview : judith hartl -lrb- km -rrb- edited by : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 25.06.2009 dresden loses unesco world heritage status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see the unesco loss as a setback for dresden 's image unesco has dropped the german city of dresden from its list of world heritage sites for constructing a disputed bridge that un officials say will ruin the city 's historic elbe valley landscape . the move makes dresden just the second site to lose its status since the world heritage list was created in 1972 .
some officials say the loss will damage both dresden 's reputation and its tourism revenues .
but a recent poll showed that more than half of the people living in the city are willing to see the title go .
the saga of dresden 's world cultural heritage status has been going on almost since the city was granted the title , in 2004 , for its beautifully conserved river landscape .
in 2005 , the town proposed a bridge across the elbe , and that structure has been at the heart of the dispute ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building site is already an eyesore , some say conservationists warned that if it was built according to plan , the waldschloesschen bridge would ruin the 20-kilometer long -lrb- 12 mile -rrb- , world heritage-worthy stretch of dresden cityscape .
urban planners countered that it is needed to reduce traffic congestion .
the seemingly endless debate has seen as many twists and turns as the meandering elbe river itself , involving several reworked plans for the bridge , public demonstrations , back-and-forth legal actions , and a debate over an endangered species of bat .
but what does it really mean to have - and lose - a cultural heritage title ?
the answer depends on who is being asked .
impact both practical and symbolic unesco world heritage designation is attached to some 878 cultural and natural properties world-wide , from the taj mahal to the grand canyon to the great barrier reef .
including dresden , germany has 33 of these sites .
in practical terms , the loss could mean fewer tourists coming to dresden , says martin roth , the director of the dresden state art collections .
" the bridge , which is architecturally banal and was pushed through against all warnings to the contrary , is idiotic , " roth told germany 's tagesspiegel newspaper . the dispute has led to a " damaged image " for dresden , and the fact that the city has seen a 10 percent drop in toursim this year is " not due to the economic crisis alone , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the buddhas in bamiyan , afghanistan , are also on the list but it seems that damage to dresden 's image as a post-war , post-communist success story cuts deeper than any financial pain the city might feel .
' shame on germany ' the move " will severely tarnish dresden 's status as a cultural icon … .
it will also greatly diminish the impact of dresden 's message of reconciliation " in the wake of world war ii , " guenter blobel , the founder of the nonprofit organization friends of dresden , wrote in an op-ed piece in the new york times .
the move also shames germany , blobel added .
the image of a " wealthy country letting one of its world cultural heritage go to waste while many poorer countries struggle to maintain theirs " is disturbing .
indeed , no other european country has a spot on the " red list " of 30 sites that are currently in danger of losing their status .
most of these endangered sites are in poor and violence-ravaged countries , including the democratic republic of congo , afghanistan , iraq and yemen , to name just a few .
-lrb- so far , unesco has struck only one other site from the list : the arabian oryx sanctuary in oman . -rrb-
poll shows citizens unmoved still , dresden 's citizens do not seem much bothered by the threat of loss .
in a snap survey of 500 people conducted for the local newspaper the sächsische zeiutung , 57 percent of those asked said the unesco title is not absolutely necessary .
younger people were generally less concerned than older folks , with a full 61 percent of those between 30 and 49 saying the city did not need the unesco heritage designation .
however , 44 percent complained that the city should have done more to maintain the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's reconstruction was hard-won in two separate plebiscites , dresden citizens have voted in favor of the bridge .
some city officials who support the project say that while dresden might lose its official unesco designation , the bridge has become a symbol of something even more important for a post-communist city like dresden : citizen action .
" in a democracy , we can not have a dictatorship of a minority that , acting out of cultural or aesthetic grounds , thinks they know more than the overwhelming majority of citizens , " wrote dresden city councilman jan mücke , in a commentary in the s-z online newspaper .
symbol of democracy ?
for mücke , the construction of the wadschloesschen bridge is " a symbol of an educated and self-confident citizenry , which wants to make its own decisions without being criticized or accused of being culturally backwards . "
bridges have been an enriching part of the european landscape for centuries , muecke added .
now , it looks like the european landscape will have one more bridge - and one less landscape deemed worthy of a cultural heritage designation .

some officials say the loss will damage both dresden 's reputation and its tourism revenues .
but a recent poll showed that more than half of the people living in the city are willing to see the title go .
the saga of dresden 's world cultural heritage status has been going on almost since the city was granted the title , in 2004 , for its beautifully conserved river landscape .
in 2005 , the town proposed a bridge across the elbe , and that structure has been at the heart of the dispute ever since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building site is already an eyesore , some say conservationists warned that if it was built according to plan , the waldschloesschen bridge would ruin the 20-kilometer long -lrb- 12 mile -rrb- , world heritage-worthy stretch of dresden cityscape .
urban planners countered that it is needed to reduce traffic congestion .
the seemingly endless debate has seen as many twists and turns as the meandering elbe river itself , involving several reworked plans for the bridge , public demonstrations , back-and-forth legal actions , and a debate over an endangered species of bat .
but what does it really mean to have - and lose - a cultural heritage title ?
the answer depends on who is being asked .
impact both practical and symbolic unesco world heritage designation is attached to some 878 cultural and natural properties world-wide , from the taj mahal to the grand canyon to the great barrier reef .
including dresden , germany has 33 of these sites .
in practical terms , the loss could mean fewer tourists coming to dresden , says martin roth , the director of the dresden state art collections .
" the bridge , which is architecturally banal and was pushed through against all warnings to the contrary , is idiotic , " roth told germany 's tagesspiegel newspaper . the dispute has led to a " damaged image " for dresden , and the fact that the city has seen a 10 percent drop in toursim this year is " not due to the economic crisis alone , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the buddhas in bamiyan , afghanistan , are also on the list but it seems that damage to dresden 's image as a post-war , post-communist success story cuts deeper than any financial pain the city might feel .
' shame on germany ' the move " will severely tarnish dresden 's status as a cultural icon … .
it will also greatly diminish the impact of dresden 's message of reconciliation " in the wake of world war ii , " guenter blobel , the founder of the nonprofit organization friends of dresden , wrote in an op-ed piece in the new york times .
the move also shames germany , blobel added .
the image of a " wealthy country letting one of its world cultural heritage go to waste while many poorer countries struggle to maintain theirs " is disturbing .
indeed , no other european country has a spot on the " red list " of 30 sites that are currently in danger of losing their status .
most of these endangered sites are in poor and violence-ravaged countries , including the democratic republic of congo , afghanistan , iraq and yemen , to name just a few .
-lrb- so far , unesco has struck only one other site from the list : the arabian oryx sanctuary in oman . -rrb-
poll shows citizens unmoved still , dresden 's citizens do not seem much bothered by the threat of loss .
in a snap survey of 500 people conducted for the local newspaper the sächsische zeiutung , 57 percent of those asked said the unesco title is not absolutely necessary .
younger people were generally less concerned than older folks , with a full 61 percent of those between 30 and 49 saying the city did not need the unesco heritage designation .
however , 44 percent complained that the city should have done more to maintain the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's reconstruction was hard-won in two separate plebiscites , dresden citizens have voted in favor of the bridge .
some city officials who support the project say that while dresden might lose its official unesco designation , the bridge has become a symbol of something even more important for a post-communist city like dresden : citizen action .
" in a democracy , we can not have a dictatorship of a minority that , acting out of cultural or aesthetic grounds , thinks they know more than the overwhelming majority of citizens , " wrote dresden city councilman jan mücke , in a commentary in the s-z online newspaper .
symbol of democracy ?
for mücke , the construction of the wadschloesschen bridge is " a symbol of an educated and self-confident citizenry , which wants to make its own decisions without being criticized or accused of being culturally backwards . "
bridges have been an enriching part of the european landscape for centuries , muecke added .
now , it looks like the european landscape will have one more bridge - and one less landscape deemed worthy of a cultural heritage designation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 25.06.2009 indian telecom tycoon ’ s success formula großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairman of bharti enterprises sunil bharti mittal india ’ s telecom tycoon sunil bharti mittal has recently been awarded the global economics prize by the german state government of schleswig-holstein and the kiel institute of global economics .
the prize honours those who have proposed creative , path-breaking initiatives to deal with globalization . thinking big and being creative could be described as sunil bharti mittal ’ s secret .
mittal was merely 18 years old when he started showing his entrepreneurial skills .
he started a cycle manufacturing unit with a small amount of capital in 1976 .
now , at the age of 51 , he has indeed come a long way .
mittal owns and runs india ’ s leading telecom company bharti airtel , which has been competing for the top spot with rival reliance .
in his speech at the awards ceremony in kiel , mittal outlined his company 's global ambitions : “ now we are attempting to take our indian business model global .
we are in a discussion with one telecom company in africa and the middle east called mtn , put together we 'll be the third largest telecom company in the world .
and we believe what we have achieved in india in serving indian population at very low cost tariffs is a model to be taken around the globe . ”
introducing push-button phones short in height but big in gesture and personality , with glowing eyes and full of determination , sunil bharti mittal never gave up .
while searching for new options in business , he came across push-button phones .
“ i landed in taipei in taiwan and saw push button phones .
until that time we had rotary phones and only a few hundred thousand at that .
i said to myself that this will work . ”
german collaboration mittal began to import all the parts of the push-button phones in different cities of india and started an assembly line in a small garage .
soon the government banned the import and gave the licence to seven big companies .
mittal couldn ’ t get one .
yet , instead of giving up he entered into cooperation with the german company siemens .
this was a turning point of his life , he remembers : “ what i learned was not only to manufacture the phones but what i learned was the great german discipline , great german manufacturing prowess and that really fired up my imagination , because this was the country from where one could pick up the ideas and technology and deploy it to india . ”
inspiration and innovation this inspiration and technology paved mittal 's way to launch india ’ s first cordless phones , answering machines and fax machines .
in 1994 mittal got the licence for mobile phone operations in the capital , new delhi .
that was when an expert committee suggested that delhi would need just 10,000 mobile phones .
mittal says : “ delhi last week clocked 18 million phones in total of which five belong to my company .
we have around 400 million phones in the country .
my company has only 100 million . ”
one cent a minute and less than two dollars a month are the rates of airtel mobile .
mittal says that cheap telephony is needed in all parts of the world so that everybody can use a mobile .
talking to deutsche welle in kiel , mittal said that he missed his childhood a lot , and his motto is : one should follow one 's dreams , they do come true .

the german dairy company muellermilch , she added , was able to milk the eu cash cow for a new creamery it built in the eastern german state of saxony .
" while building the new plant , muellermilch closed two of its older ones in western germany - on balance , the eu spent 70 million euros to enable the company to scrap 17 jobs , " benning said . privacy v. transparency the obligation to make the payments transparent dates from a bitterly contested reform of the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- in 2006 .

" under these circumstances the commission has no alternative but open legal proceedings against germany , " the eu commission said in a statement . following a 2006 eu decision – also carried by germany – all data on the recipients of agricultural subsidies must be published on the internet since the beginning of may . germany , which receives about 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- in agricultural subisidies from brussels each year , was the last country in the 27-nation eu to publish the names of beneficiaries of farm aid with a six-week delay in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers have a powerful lobby in germany , especially those from bavaria however , bavaria – a german state that has a powerful farmers lobby and a long history of antagonizing berlin and brussels - has been withholding data on the grounds that brussels ' demands were in breach of data protection laws , sparking a legal battle with the eu judiciary .
the bavarian agricultural ministry said it would withhold data on bavarian farmers until the european court has ruled on the legality of the move .
germany now has a month to respond before brussels takes further steps , which could result in a court case at the european court of justice and heavy fines . milking the eu cash cow the issue of agricultural subsidies has been a touchy business for decades , but recently things came to a head when it emerged that some recipients in germany are not farmers in the traditional sense , but millionaires , big corporations , or even organizations that have no links to agriculture . reinhild benning , an activist with the german environmental group bund , has taken a closer look at how the eu farm aid has been spent in germany . she found out that the german airline , lufthansa , has been receiving subsidies for dairy products it serves its passengers on transcontinental flights .
" under eu rules this constitutes an export for which the airline absurdly receives export subsidies to the tune of two-and-a-half-million euros , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agricultural subsidies do not always end up where they 're most needed another example of questionable eu subsidies , she said , were 500,000 euros in annual subsidies received by the german energy giant rwe for measures aimed at re-cultivating coalmining areas in eastern germany .
the german dairy company muellermilch , she added , was able to milk the eu cash cow for a new creamery it built in the eastern german state of saxony .
" while building the new plant , muellermilch closed two of its older ones in western germany - on balance , the eu spent 70 million euros to enable the company to scrap 17 jobs , " benning said . privacy v. transparency the obligation to make the payments transparent dates from a bitterly contested reform of the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- in 2006 .
at the time , notably britain demanded greater accountability with regard to farm subsidies which eat up some 40 percent of the eu ’ s annual budget .
however , critics say the publication of names and amounts is a violation of privacy rules .
" i would have preferred a solution in which the names of major recipients only are disclosed " , peter schaar , the german commissioner for data protection , said .
schaar said it would have been better to determine a limit for subsidies above which recipients would be obliged to disclose full details .

the us squad will now face brazil , the winner of thursday 's semifinal against south africa . the united states scored its greatest win in almost 60 years by beating european champions spain to reach the final of the confederations cup .
a first-half strike from villareal 's jozy altidore and another goal 16 minutes from time by fulham 's clint dempsey did the damage in what will go down as one of the biggest victories in us soccer history .
" this win is huge for american soccer , " said man of the match dempsey .
" this is our first time to be in the final of a major competition , so obviously we 're thrilled . "
spain is currently ranked as the world 's best team by fifa , the governing body of world soccer .
but for spain the defeat was even more painful as it ended a record of 15 consecutive wins and also prevented them from surpassing brazil 's record of 35-match unbeaten runs .
spain had not been defeated since going down 1-0 in a friendly to romania in november 2006 .
us faces brazil in sunday 's final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few had expected the us could throw out the favorites " a lot of people did n't think we could do this , " us defender oguchi onyewu said after the game .
" but we showed our heart , our grit and our resilience .
it 's a huge achievement for us .
i bet there were n't a lot of people in europe and around the world that would have bet on this . "
even spanish striker fernando torres was forced to admit that his side was up against a more-than-worthy opponent .
" they have fantastic players and a strong team , and maybe by beating spain and breaking our streak people will start to recognize that . "
the result was even more remarkable because the us had lost their opening two group matches in the competition and were heading out until they beat egypt 3-0 on sunday .
after brazil had sunk italy by the same score , the us only squeezed through on the numbers of goals scored .
however , the match ended in bittersweet agony for the us when michael bradley , after a brilliant game in midfield , was sent off three minutes from time .
he will now miss sunday 's final against brazil , which beat south africa in the other semi-final thursday night. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us squad will now face brazil , the winner of thursday 's semifinal against south africa . the united states scored its greatest win in almost 60 years by beating european champions spain to reach the final of the confederations cup .
a first-half strike from villareal 's jozy altidore and another goal 16 minutes from time by fulham 's clint dempsey did the damage in what will go down as one of the biggest victories in us soccer history .
" this win is huge for american soccer , " said man of the match dempsey .
" this is our first time to be in the final of a major competition , so obviously we 're thrilled . "
spain is currently ranked as the world 's best team by fifa , the governing body of world soccer .
but for spain the defeat was even more painful as it ended a record of 15 consecutive wins and also prevented them from surpassing brazil 's record of 35-match unbeaten runs .
spain had not been defeated since going down 1-0 in a friendly to romania in november 2006 .
us faces brazil in sunday 's final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few had expected the us could throw out the favorites " a lot of people did n't think we could do this , " us defender oguchi onyewu said after the game .
" but we showed our heart , our grit and our resilience .
it 's a huge achievement for us .
i bet there were n't a lot of people in europe and around the world that would have bet on this . "
even spanish striker fernando torres was forced to admit that his side was up against a more-than-worthy opponent .
" they have fantastic players and a strong team , and maybe by beating spain and breaking our streak people will start to recognize that . "
the result was even more remarkable because the us had lost their opening two group matches in the competition and were heading out until they beat egypt 3-0 on sunday .
after brazil had sunk italy by the same score , the us only squeezed through on the numbers of goals scored .
however , the match ended in bittersweet agony for the us when michael bradley , after a brilliant game in midfield , was sent off three minutes from time .

" the presidency regrets the fact that despite determined efforts and numerous attempts by the presidency and the european commission there has been no progress in the accession talks , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement . croatia had hoped to conclude eu entry talks by the end of the year , but that that now looks like an unlikely prospect . eu member slovenia has blocked croatia 's entry talks , arguing that they are prejudicial to the outcome of the two countries ' border dispute , which centers around the coastal town of piran and access rights to the adriatic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carl bildt says croatia and slovenia need time to reflect sweden , which takes over the eu presidency in july , said this week it plans no fresh attempt to help settle the row , which swedish foreign minister carl bildt called a bilateral issue .

2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " more information : boozing to oblivion - alcohol abuse amongst young people on the internet the latest report by the federal commissioner on drugs in germany raised widespread concern here .
more than 23,000 young people had to be treated for alcohol poisoning in german hospitals last year .
binge drinking is becoming increasingly popular .
and not only that , many young people are now also filming their excessive drinking and posting it on the internet .
experts are warning of the copycat effect , and many involved in youth welfare are calling for such websites to be blocked .
the federal center for health education has launched a huge campaign this week aimed at discouraging alcohol abuse .
our question is : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " herbert fuchs , finland , says both nature and nurture matter : " this question is tough to answer .
many children and young people grow up in an environment marked by indescribable poverty – in the high-rises and backyards of the big city , where nothing works anymore and even the landlord is out of work .
where the unemployed parents and neighbors pass the time , the endlessly long days with no positive prospects for the future – that ’ s where life is more than difficult to bear .
yes , and in public and school life , these young people bear their dammed-up fury in a new way – resorting to senseless boozing and violence against others – the way they see and experience it in their nearby surroundings on a daily basis .
for these youth , the experience of success is what ’ s missing most , of being able to do something , for example , to play an instrument or have a hobby .
and academic achievements no longer count in a place where everything has gone haywire .
it ’ s a vicious cycle , and alcohol is the final nail that they can cling to .
the negative side of globalization – which we ’ ve all been made to believe will bring us prosperity – a future – is a revolution that is putting society in the poorhouse .
teenage binge drinking is the best example of that , of our unraveling society .
not until people are able to find work and bread will many a family be able to live in peace without boozing ...
these young people need role models – among them , their parents and everything that comes along with a peaceful coexistence . "
germany ’ s hannelore krause supports a multi-pronged approach : " i think that it ’ s not just poverty and frustration that drive young people to drinking .
more often it ’ s considered cool for young people today to test their strength by guzzling alcohol like water in a drive to prove that they ’ re finally grown up .
as long as it ’ s easy for youth to get their hands on alcohol – whether it ’ s from a parent ’ s house , the gas station , the grocery or wherever – alcohol abuse will be impossible to stop .
tough punishments are necessary from those who procure alcohol for minors and young people – regardless of the form it takes and how strong it is .
and : parents need to take responsibility for their children .
taking steps to explain the consequences of alcohol consumption should start at home with the parents and continue in the classroom , where teachers must also address the fact that alcohol creates not just highs and lows but also destroys one ’ s illusions – as happens with binge drinking – and can lead to death .
the internet , too , must guard against posts glorifying alcohol abuse . "
rolf bockmühl of the philippines blames the media – and government : " i think not !
our society and its families are falling apart .
solidarity , insofar as us older folks know it , hardly exists anymore ...
alcohol is too cheap , consumption is on the rise .
boozing is almost normal .
magazines , newspapers and television show people drinking and smoking far too often -lrb- and dw-tv deserves some of the blame -rrb- .
any kind of warning comes too late because young people don ’ t promote any kind of abstinence from alcohol and cigarettes in their cliques .
in such groups -lrb- as my grandchildren like to tell their grandfather -rrb- , the popular ones are those who are " strong . "
being strong means " heavy drinking and heavy bragging , " especially in public , if possible .
unlimited drinking is just one part of my concern .
unfortunately , many families are also at fault because they don ’ t provide children with role models .
as adolescents , we drank alcohol , too .
due to financial reasons , though , just a little .
we also didn ’ t have the time for it .
six-day weeks were normal , as was overtime .
then there was the sports club .
that was it .
we don ’ t want to have to go through tough times like that again .
i don ’ t begrudge today ’ s youth of their freedom and free time .
it ’ s just – where , when and how have families and society adjusted to rapid consumption and the fast-paced internet era ?
what do schools have to say ?
both of my school-aged children came to learn to value free time , both during and in addition to their studies .
the pressure to perform set in during exam week , but that ’ s it .
evening excursions ended all too often – in my opinion – and for the ladies , too , in various stages of drunkenness .
such were the " freedoms " of the students , whose parents were happy to pay for everything .
did we spoil our children with the " good " in life ?
that ’ s what i ask myself today .
stricter laws hardly help .
penalties don ’ t help , either .
i think that families and families alone are the ones able to instill values in their children .
can families from the so-called " impoverished " classes achieve that , too ?
there ’ s a big problem here .
why is the government letting so many people fall by the wayside ?
that ’ s something the government is at risk of doing ...
the bottom line : i don ’ t see any clear way of tackling this problem .
it ’ s humiliating for me – i feel helpless .
where is our society headed ? "
gerhard seeger , also of the philippines , supports a smarter kind of information campaign : " bans on alcohol are useless – otherwise the problem wouldn ’ t exist .
alcohol abuse can only be stopped by young people themselves , insofar as they understand what it does to them and that this kind of binge drinking is disgusting .
sure , they ’ re young people , but they ’ re not little kids anymore .
there ’ s already plenty of information out there on the dangers of the " drug " alcohol , but it could stand to be stepped up in a targeted way .
and manufacturers should print warnings in ads and on bottles – every kind of container – that highlight alcohol ’ s dangers , not just to one ’ s own health , but to others as well . "
lee davis of the united states sees the economic crisis as a cause : " the short answer : probably not .
you need to remember that young people follow the example of their parents .
children are bothered by the recession , too .
when the economy improves , binge drinking should subside . "
syria ’ s mohanad mahli says " just saying no " doesn ’ t work : " i am against a ban on alcohol for young people .
that just makes alcohol more attractive .
breaking the law has its own kind of appeal ! "
rené junghans of brazil contends that alcohol abuse reflects parental lapses : " the abuse of alcohol by teenagers can very well be stopped through comprehensive education .
when young people post instances of their binge drinking all over the internet , the state should add appropriate posts to blogs that clearly point out the dangers of alcohol abuse .
in other respects , the situation shows a clear failure by parents who have neglected to raise their children with the necessary amount of love and security .
the children of parents who abandon their offspring are in search of an alternative to bury their frustrations .
children who feel safe and loved by their parents resort neither to alcohol nor to drugs .
my son is a good example of this .
lovingly brought up according to christian beliefs , he is a very good student , attentive , well-raised and he doesn ’ t drink , smoke or do drugs . "

2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " more information : boozing to oblivion - alcohol abuse amongst young people on the internet the latest report by the federal commissioner on drugs in germany raised widespread concern here .
more than 23,000 young people had to be treated for alcohol poisoning in german hospitals last year .
binge drinking is becoming increasingly popular .
and not only that , many young people are now also filming their excessive drinking and posting it on the internet .
experts are warning of the copycat effect , and many involved in youth welfare are calling for such websites to be blocked .
the federal center for health education has launched a huge campaign this week aimed at discouraging alcohol abuse .
our question is : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " herbert fuchs , finland , says both nature and nurture matter : " this question is tough to answer .
many children and young people grow up in an environment marked by indescribable poverty – in the high-rises and backyards of the big city , where nothing works anymore and even the landlord is out of work .
where the unemployed parents and neighbors pass the time , the endlessly long days with no positive prospects for the future – that ’ s where life is more than difficult to bear .
yes , and in public and school life , these young people bear their dammed-up fury in a new way – resorting to senseless boozing and violence against others – the way they see and experience it in their nearby surroundings on a daily basis .
for these youth , the experience of success is what ’ s missing most , of being able to do something , for example , to play an instrument or have a hobby .
and academic achievements no longer count in a place where everything has gone haywire .
it ’ s a vicious cycle , and alcohol is the final nail that they can cling to .
the negative side of globalization – which we ’ ve all been made to believe will bring us prosperity – a future – is a revolution that is putting society in the poorhouse .
teenage binge drinking is the best example of that , of our unraveling society .
not until people are able to find work and bread will many a family be able to live in peace without boozing ...
these young people need role models – among them , their parents and everything that comes along with a peaceful coexistence . "
germany ’ s hannelore krause supports a multi-pronged approach : " i think that it ’ s not just poverty and frustration that drive young people to drinking .
more often it ’ s considered cool for young people today to test their strength by guzzling alcohol like water in a drive to prove that they ’ re finally grown up .
as long as it ’ s easy for youth to get their hands on alcohol – whether it ’ s from a parent ’ s house , the gas station , the grocery or wherever – alcohol abuse will be impossible to stop .
tough punishments are necessary from those who procure alcohol for minors and young people – regardless of the form it takes and how strong it is .
and : parents need to take responsibility for their children .
taking steps to explain the consequences of alcohol consumption should start at home with the parents and continue in the classroom , where teachers must also address the fact that alcohol creates not just highs and lows but also destroys one ’ s illusions – as happens with binge drinking – and can lead to death .
the internet , too , must guard against posts glorifying alcohol abuse . "
rolf bockmühl of the philippines blames the media – and government : " i think not !
our society and its families are falling apart .
solidarity , insofar as us older folks know it , hardly exists anymore ...
alcohol is too cheap , consumption is on the rise .
boozing is almost normal .
magazines , newspapers and television show people drinking and smoking far too often -lrb- and dw-tv deserves some of the blame -rrb- .
any kind of warning comes too late because young people don ’ t promote any kind of abstinence from alcohol and cigarettes in their cliques .
in such groups -lrb- as my grandchildren like to tell their grandfather -rrb- , the popular ones are those who are " strong . "
being strong means " heavy drinking and heavy bragging , " especially in public , if possible .
unlimited drinking is just one part of my concern .
unfortunately , many families are also at fault because they don ’ t provide children with role models .
as adolescents , we drank alcohol , too .
due to financial reasons , though , just a little .
we also didn ’ t have the time for it .
six-day weeks were normal , as was overtime .
then there was the sports club .
that was it .
we don ’ t want to have to go through tough times like that again .
i don ’ t begrudge today ’ s youth of their freedom and free time .
it ’ s just – where , when and how have families and society adjusted to rapid consumption and the fast-paced internet era ?
what do schools have to say ?
both of my school-aged children came to learn to value free time , both during and in addition to their studies .
the pressure to perform set in during exam week , but that ’ s it .
evening excursions ended all too often – in my opinion – and for the ladies , too , in various stages of drunkenness .
such were the " freedoms " of the students , whose parents were happy to pay for everything .
did we spoil our children with the " good " in life ?
that ’ s what i ask myself today .
stricter laws hardly help .
penalties don ’ t help , either .
i think that families and families alone are the ones able to instill values in their children .
can families from the so-called " impoverished " classes achieve that , too ?
there ’ s a big problem here .
why is the government letting so many people fall by the wayside ?
that ’ s something the government is at risk of doing ...
the bottom line : i don ’ t see any clear way of tackling this problem .
it ’ s humiliating for me – i feel helpless .
where is our society headed ? "
gerhard seeger , also of the philippines , supports a smarter kind of information campaign : " bans on alcohol are useless – otherwise the problem wouldn ’ t exist .
alcohol abuse can only be stopped by young people themselves , insofar as they understand what it does to them and that this kind of binge drinking is disgusting .
sure , they ’ re young people , but they ’ re not little kids anymore .
there ’ s already plenty of information out there on the dangers of the " drug " alcohol , but it could stand to be stepped up in a targeted way .
and manufacturers should print warnings in ads and on bottles – every kind of container – that highlight alcohol ’ s dangers , not just to one ’ s own health , but to others as well . "
lee davis of the united states sees the economic crisis as a cause : " the short answer : probably not .
you need to remember that young people follow the example of their parents .
children are bothered by the recession , too .
when the economy improves , binge drinking should subside . "
syria ’ s mohanad mahli says " just saying no " doesn ’ t work : " i am against a ban on alcohol for young people .
that just makes alcohol more attractive .
breaking the law has its own kind of appeal ! "
rené junghans of brazil contends that alcohol abuse reflects parental lapses : " the abuse of alcohol by teenagers can very well be stopped through comprehensive education .
when young people post instances of their binge drinking all over the internet , the state should add appropriate posts to blogs that clearly point out the dangers of alcohol abuse .
in other respects , the situation shows a clear failure by parents who have neglected to raise their children with the necessary amount of love and security .
the children of parents who abandon their offspring are in search of an alternative to bury their frustrations .
children who feel safe and loved by their parents resort neither to alcohol nor to drugs .
my son is a good example of this .
lovingly brought up according to christian beliefs , he is a very good student , attentive , well-raised and he doesn ’ t drink , smoke or do drugs . "

more often it ’ s considered cool for young people today to test their strength by guzzling alcohol like water in a drive to prove that they ’ re finally grown up .
as long as it ’ s easy for youth to get their hands on alcohol – whether it ’ s from a parent ’ s house , the gas station , the grocery or wherever – alcohol abuse will be impossible to stop .
tough punishments are necessary from those who procure alcohol for minors and young people – regardless of the form it takes and how strong it is .
and : parents need to take responsibility for their children .
taking steps to explain the consequences of alcohol consumption should start at home with the parents and continue in the classroom , where teachers must also address the fact that alcohol creates not just highs and lows but also destroys one ’ s illusions – as happens with binge drinking – and can lead to death .
the internet , too , must guard against posts glorifying alcohol abuse . "
rolf bockmühl of the philippines blames the media – and government : " i think not !
our society and its families are falling apart .
solidarity , insofar as us older folks know it , hardly exists anymore ...
alcohol is too cheap , consumption is on the rise .
boozing is almost normal .
magazines , newspapers and television show people drinking and smoking far too often -lrb- and dw-tv deserves some of the blame -rrb- .
any kind of warning comes too late because young people don ’ t promote any kind of abstinence from alcohol and cigarettes in their cliques .
in such groups -lrb- as my grandchildren like to tell their grandfather -rrb- , the popular ones are those who are " strong . "
being strong means " heavy drinking and heavy bragging , " especially in public , if possible .
unlimited drinking is just one part of my concern .
unfortunately , many families are also at fault because they don ’ t provide children with role models .
as adolescents , we drank alcohol , too .
due to financial reasons , though , just a little .
we also didn ’ t have the time for it .
six-day weeks were normal , as was overtime .
then there was the sports club .
that was it .
we don ’ t want to have to go through tough times like that again .
i don ’ t begrudge today ’ s youth of their freedom and free time .
it ’ s just – where , when and how have families and society adjusted to rapid consumption and the fast-paced internet era ?
what do schools have to say ?
both of my school-aged children came to learn to value free time , both during and in addition to their studies .
the pressure to perform set in during exam week , but that ’ s it .
evening excursions ended all too often – in my opinion – and for the ladies , too , in various stages of drunkenness .
such were the " freedoms " of the students , whose parents were happy to pay for everything .
did we spoil our children with the " good " in life ?
that ’ s what i ask myself today .
stricter laws hardly help .
penalties don ’ t help , either .
i think that families and families alone are the ones able to instill values in their children .
can families from the so-called " impoverished " classes achieve that , too ?
there ’ s a big problem here .
why is the government letting so many people fall by the wayside ?
that ’ s something the government is at risk of doing ...
the bottom line : i don ’ t see any clear way of tackling this problem .
it ’ s humiliating for me – i feel helpless .
where is our society headed ? "
gerhard seeger , also of the philippines , supports a smarter kind of information campaign : " bans on alcohol are useless – otherwise the problem wouldn ’ t exist .
alcohol abuse can only be stopped by young people themselves , insofar as they understand what it does to them and that this kind of binge drinking is disgusting .
sure , they ’ re young people , but they ’ re not little kids anymore .
there ’ s already plenty of information out there on the dangers of the " drug " alcohol , but it could stand to be stepped up in a targeted way .
and manufacturers should print warnings in ads and on bottles – every kind of container – that highlight alcohol ’ s dangers , not just to one ’ s own health , but to others as well . "
lee davis of the united states sees the economic crisis as a cause : " the short answer : probably not .
you need to remember that young people follow the example of their parents .
children are bothered by the recession , too .
when the economy improves , binge drinking should subside . "
syria ’ s mohanad mahli says " just saying no " doesn ’ t work : " i am against a ban on alcohol for young people .
that just makes alcohol more attractive .
breaking the law has its own kind of appeal ! "
rené junghans of brazil contends that alcohol abuse reflects parental lapses : " the abuse of alcohol by teenagers can very well be stopped through comprehensive education .
when young people post instances of their binge drinking all over the internet , the state should add appropriate posts to blogs that clearly point out the dangers of alcohol abuse .
in other respects , the situation shows a clear failure by parents who have neglected to raise their children with the necessary amount of love and security .
the children of parents who abandon their offspring are in search of an alternative to bury their frustrations .
children who feel safe and loved by their parents resort neither to alcohol nor to drugs .
my son is a good example of this .
lovingly brought up according to christian beliefs , he is a very good student , attentive , well-raised and he doesn ’ t drink , smoke or do drugs . "

as tehran is widening its crackdown on the opposition , 70 university professors were detained after meeting with opposition figures . mahmoud ahmadinejad has renewed his criticism of western governments who have condemned tehran 's handling of the disputed presidential elections .
on thursday the iranian president lashed out against his us counterpart barack obama , warning that comments from washington could torpedo any future dialogue between the two countries .
" will you use this language with iran ?
if this is your stance , there will be nothing left to talk about , " ahmadinejad was quoted by the semi-official fars news agency , referring to the us president .
obama has recently has ramped up his previously muted criticism , saying he was " appalled and outraged " by the crackdown on protesters .
ahmadinejad reacted by comparing obama to his predecessor georg w. bush .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran is not amused about western backing for the opposition " mr obama made a mistake to say those things , " he said .
" our question is why he fell into this trap and said things that previously bush used to say . "
the turmoil has dimmed prospects for obama 's outreach to iran over its nuclear program . washington has withdrawn invitations to iranian diplomats to attend us independence day celebrations on july 4 , stalling efforts to improve ties with tehran .
mourning ceremony called off as crackdown continues meanwhile , one of three defeated iranian presidential candidates , mehdi karroubi , has cancelled a thursday ceremony mourning the deaths of at least 17 protesters killed in post-election unrest .
karroubi 's website says he was unable to secure a venue for the event , and that he hopes to hold the ceremony next week instead .
iran 's interior ministry has banned all gatherings by opposition groups , who are protesting what they call fraud in the election that returned president mahmoud ahmadinejad to power .
in related news , an online statement from another key opposition figure , mir hossein mousavi , says that 70 academics and representatives from a number of universities were arrested after meeting him on wednesday .
hundreds of protesters and activists are believed to have been taken into custody since the june 12 elections .
the elections showed incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad winning a landslide victory , but the results are widely disputed .

italian foreign minister franco frattini said iran was " at a turning point " following the post-election street clashes , in which at least 17 people have been killed .
' ' it must choose whether or not to keep the door open to dialogue with the international community , " he said .
" the hand extended by the united states , which we have supported , can not come back with blood on it , " frattini said .
' ' we will adopt a particularly tough and clear position . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too said he expected foreign ministers from the industrialized nations of the group of eight to take a common line on the violence in iran .
russia against isolating iran but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that isolating iran would be the " wrong approach " for the g8 .
after a meeting with frattini , lavrov said " no-one " wanted to condemn tehran . rome had originally invited iran to attend the three-day gathering , arguing that tehran could have an important role to play in stabilizing afghanistan - a key focus of the meeting .
but rome retracted the invitation after tehran failed to respond and after days of violent clashes with demonstrators protesting iran 's disputed june 12 elections .
" i think it 's a missed opportunity for the iranian government , " european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said .
she condemned " the excessive use of force by the security forces against any peaceful demonstrators . "
unrest in tehran continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians protest against the disputed election results at a rally in paris millions of iranians accuse the government of fraud in the june 12 election which gave president mahmoud ahmadinejad an verwhelming landslide victory , prompting protest demonstrations in which at least 17 people were killed .
in another development on thursday , iranian state media said that eight members of the pro-government basij militia had been killed and dozens more wounded in the protests .
the eight deaths were in addition to 17 other people whose deaths have already been reported .
the figures can not be verified due to severe reporting restrictions inside iran .
meeting to focus on afghanistan-pakistan border unrest another topic at the talks in trieste on friday would be developments in afghanistan and pakistan , whose foreign ministers will both be present .
germany launched the " afpak " regional cooperation programme during its g8 presidency two years ago .
berlin now expects this dialogue to enable significant cooperation between the two countries in combating terrorism .
germany has also committed 90 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- in aid to the border region between afghanistan and pakistan .
taliban militants have stepped up their attacks as fears grow that islamist extremists are exacting revenge for a six-week military offensive against them in three northwest districts .
taliban-linked attacks have killed around 2,000 people in pakistan since july 2007 .
the eu said that it would call for international support for pakistan 's efforts against taliban-led extremists but also an " integrated long-term strategy , which includes social economic development , civilian law-enforcement structures and the rule of law , in order to secure the gains of the present counter-insurgency operations on a permanent basis . "
" in contrast to us military power , the eu has been concentrating on the civilian aspect ; a soft power surge , " said shada islam , head of the asia program at the european policy center in brussels .
" this is done through a ' hearts and minds ' approach , using development aid and the promotion of a more balanced counter insurgency policy . "
according to daniel korski , a senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , the eu 's involvement in other aspects of the counter-insurgency mission has proved to be as important as any military investment .
more help needed for swat valley residents the fighting in the swat valley and northern provinces has taken a huge toll on the people of the region with un figures suggesting as many as 2.5 million pakistanis have been displaced by the conflict .
g8 leaders are expected to provide additional financial assistance to help the refugees on top of the 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- the eu pledged in may .
bildunterschrift : the inhabitants of swat valley are now housed in refugee camps " the eu was fast in reacting to the crisis but much more urgently needs to be done and it has recognized that , " shada islam said .
" what the eu needs to do , apart from increasing its aid , is be very visible in the refugee camps and show its support .
the religious groups fighting the government are already in these camps and if there is a sign that the west 's help is slow , they will strengthen their grip . "
" also , as is the case in asia , refugees are being taken in by family members which puts families under immense strain .
the eu can provide financial assistance to these families .
public opinion is in favor of this offensive and it 's very important to get aid to the refugees quickly to keep this support going . "

italian foreign minister franco frattini said iran was " at a turning point " following the post-election street clashes , in which at least 17 people have been killed .
' ' it must choose whether or not to keep the door open to dialogue with the international community , " he said .
" the hand extended by the united states , which we have supported , can not come back with blood on it , " frattini said .
' ' we will adopt a particularly tough and clear position . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too said he expected foreign ministers from the industrialized nations of the group of eight to take a common line on the violence in iran .
russia against isolating iran but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that isolating iran would be the " wrong approach " for the g8 .
after a meeting with frattini , lavrov said " no-one " wanted to condemn tehran . rome had originally invited iran to attend the three-day gathering , arguing that tehran could have an important role to play in stabilizing afghanistan - a key focus of the meeting .
but rome retracted the invitation after tehran failed to respond and after days of violent clashes with demonstrators protesting iran 's disputed june 12 elections .
" i think it 's a missed opportunity for the iranian government , " european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said .
she condemned " the excessive use of force by the security forces against any peaceful demonstrators . "
unrest in tehran continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians protest against the disputed election results at a rally in paris millions of iranians accuse the government of fraud in the june 12 election which gave president mahmoud ahmadinejad an verwhelming landslide victory , prompting protest demonstrations in which at least 17 people were killed .
in another development on thursday , iranian state media said that eight members of the pro-government basij militia had been killed and dozens more wounded in the protests .
the eight deaths were in addition to 17 other people whose deaths have already been reported .
the figures can not be verified due to severe reporting restrictions inside iran .
meeting to focus on afghanistan-pakistan border unrest another topic at the talks in trieste on friday would be developments in afghanistan and pakistan , whose foreign ministers will both be present .
germany launched the " afpak " regional cooperation programme during its g8 presidency two years ago .
berlin now expects this dialogue to enable significant cooperation between the two countries in combating terrorism .
germany has also committed 90 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- in aid to the border region between afghanistan and pakistan .
taliban militants have stepped up their attacks as fears grow that islamist extremists are exacting revenge for a six-week military offensive against them in three northwest districts .
taliban-linked attacks have killed around 2,000 people in pakistan since july 2007 .
the eu said that it would call for international support for pakistan 's efforts against taliban-led extremists but also an " integrated long-term strategy , which includes social economic development , civilian law-enforcement structures and the rule of law , in order to secure the gains of the present counter-insurgency operations on a permanent basis . "
" in contrast to us military power , the eu has been concentrating on the civilian aspect ; a soft power surge , " said shada islam , head of the asia program at the european policy center in brussels .
" this is done through a ' hearts and minds ' approach , using development aid and the promotion of a more balanced counter insurgency policy . "
according to daniel korski , a senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , the eu 's involvement in other aspects of the counter-insurgency mission has proved to be as important as any military investment .

" i think it 's a missed opportunity for the iranian government , " european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said .
she condemned " the excessive use of force by the security forces against any peaceful demonstrators . "
unrest in tehran continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians protest against the disputed election results at a rally in paris millions of iranians accuse the government of fraud in the june 12 election which gave president mahmoud ahmadinejad an verwhelming landslide victory , prompting protest demonstrations in which at least 17 people were killed .
in another development on thursday , iranian state media said that eight members of the pro-government basij militia had been killed and dozens more wounded in the protests .
the eight deaths were in addition to 17 other people whose deaths have already been reported .
the figures can not be verified due to severe reporting restrictions inside iran .
meeting to focus on afghanistan-pakistan border unrest another topic at the talks in trieste on friday would be developments in afghanistan and pakistan , whose foreign ministers will both be present .
germany launched the " afpak " regional cooperation programme during its g8 presidency two years ago .
berlin now expects this dialogue to enable significant cooperation between the two countries in combating terrorism .
germany has also committed 90 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- in aid to the border region between afghanistan and pakistan .
taliban militants have stepped up their attacks as fears grow that islamist extremists are exacting revenge for a six-week military offensive against them in three northwest districts .
taliban-linked attacks have killed around 2,000 people in pakistan since july 2007 .
the eu said that it would call for international support for pakistan 's efforts against taliban-led extremists but also an " integrated long-term strategy , which includes social economic development , civilian law-enforcement structures and the rule of law , in order to secure the gains of the present counter-insurgency operations on a permanent basis . "
" in contrast to us military power , the eu has been concentrating on the civilian aspect ; a soft power surge , " said shada islam , head of the asia program at the european policy center in brussels .
" this is done through a ' hearts and minds ' approach , using development aid and the promotion of a more balanced counter insurgency policy . "
according to daniel korski , a senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , the eu 's involvement in other aspects of the counter-insurgency mission has proved to be as important as any military investment .
more help needed for swat valley residents the fighting in the swat valley and northern provinces has taken a huge toll on the people of the region with un figures suggesting as many as 2.5 million pakistanis have been displaced by the conflict .
g8 leaders are expected to provide additional financial assistance to help the refugees on top of the 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- the eu pledged in may .
bildunterschrift : the inhabitants of swat valley are now housed in refugee camps " the eu was fast in reacting to the crisis but much more urgently needs to be done and it has recognized that , " shada islam said .
" what the eu needs to do , apart from increasing its aid , is be very visible in the refugee camps and show its support .
the religious groups fighting the government are already in these camps and if there is a sign that the west 's help is slow , they will strengthen their grip . "
" also , as is the case in asia , refugees are being taken in by family members which puts families under immense strain .
the eu can provide financial assistance to these families .
public opinion is in favor of this offensive and it 's very important to get aid to the refugees quickly to keep this support going . "

now , at 100 , he encourages budding composers to follow their hearts . composer elliott carter is internationally recognized as one of the leading american voices of the classical music tradition .
one of the extraordinary features of carter 's career is his astonishing productivity and creative vitality as he embarks on his eleventh decade .
he has written more than 130 works and over 40 of these in the past decade alone . dw 's breandain o 'shea met with carter during the aldeburgh music festival in the uk , where a special program of his music was being presented to celebrate his 100th birthday . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview . deutsche welle : mr. carter , you spent a period of your life in germany - around 1964 , when you wrote your much celebrated piano concerto .
how did you come to germany and how important has german music been in your career ? elliott carter : it was a time when the ford foundation and the berliner senate got to together to start what i think was called the deutsche austauschdienst -lrb- german exchange program -rrb- and they invited a number of artists - wh orden was one , i ca n't remember the rest .
you could stay there for a year .
we had a very good and interesting time . i 'd had an interest in germany since i was in college in 1920 and 1930 .
i use to go to germany - munich - hoping to learn german , but instead ended up going to wagner and mozart operas at the prinzregententheater . so i never really learned german .
i was more interested in the music than the language .
it is a country that i have greatly admired in many , many ways .
after all , most of the music i am interested in is german .
it has been an important part of my life . literature has had an incredible influence on you : proust , james joyce , thomas mann and the poetry of elizabeth bishop .
you once said literature helped you discover important aspects of music that you did n't find in compositions .
what do you mean by that ? well , of course literature deals with the actual physical world and the world that we see .
music is an imaginary thing ; in some ways it deals with what seems to be feelings and thoughts .
literature is much more concerned with how we think about the world around us , while music is much more " innerlich " -lrb- internal -rrb- . what advice would you give young composers today ? young composers should always do what they love to do .
if they love to make money , that 's one way of writing music .
and the other one is if they like to write notes . is there a difference ? of course there is , because if you really want to make money then you have to write for a large public .
if you write notes then you have to write what you think is good and hope that other people will like it .
we are all composers that are a result of a good deal of training and that training consisted partly of understanding what audiences expect .
and so as a result , the relationship of the composer to the audience is a built-in thing when you become a professional . then , of course , it does n't mean that all the audience will like it . here we are all taught to write fugues - but then who in that audience will know what a fugue is ?

analysts say the two may not agree on all issues but germany and the us are now on the same page . british prime minister gordon brown was the first major european leader to pay a visit to president barack obama in the white house .
that was back in march of this year , shortly after obama had been sworn in .
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was next in april , followed by french president nicholas sarkozy in june .
even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , embroiled in a major scandal back home in italy , was finally granted a meeting with obama in the white house in june .
only the leader of europe 's biggest economy , german chancellor angela merkel , has not yet visited the white house , sparking media speculations that relations between merkel and obama were cooler than with obama 's predecessor george w. bush . jürgen chrobog , a former german ambassador to the united states , thinks those rumors are without merit .
he points to the fact that merkel and obama have already met twice in germany .
" there was never much time to talk about things in detail , but at least they have met , they know each other and i think it 's now time to make a full official visit to the united states " , says chrobog and adds : " she could n't have waited longer . "
the timing is n't really of much significance , agrees wess mitchell , co-founder of the center for european policy analysis .
he also does n't believe that that the personal chemistry between the two leaders is markedly worse than the chemistry between merkel and bush was .
and , says chrobog , to develop personal relations takes time , especially between the german chancellor and the new american president .
" merkel is not a person who is easygoing and relaxed .
she is very northern german actually .
obama is a completely different type of person . "
delicate balance on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international response to the events in iran will be discussed between merkel and obama more importantly than the personal relationship between the leader , say the experts , are the issues facing the us and germany .
the most pressing topic to be discussed in the white house could be iran , where chancellor merkel took a tougher line against the iranian regime than obama , stating her support for the protestors and urging a full recount of the ballots .
still , gale mattox , a germany expert and currently the fulbright-dow distinguished research chair of the roosevelt study center in the netherlands , says that after some hesitation obama this week came out quite strongly on iran as well .
" it seems to me that we are pretty much on the same sheet of music now . "
former ambassador chrobog says the us administration must tread a fine line on iran .
" it would be tremendously difficult if he would put pressure on iran and give the mullah government there an argument to say everything that is happening in iran is just because of the united states .
he should never interfere now in the domestic issues of iran .
it would backfire , it would be terrible . "
economic malaise the economic crisis will of course be another dominant issue for merkel and obama at the white house .
on this topic , argues mitchell , there could be some friction between both leaders .
" merkel and the german government clearly do n't look favorably on what the us federal reserve describes as loose monetary policy . "
merkel could use the problems the german government has with the american response to the economic crisis to point the finger at the united states as the main culprit for the global crisis , says mitchell .
but it 's not just the germans who may want to ruffle some feathers .
" i think when they meet , obama will press merkel to make a more positive contribution to solving the global crisis .
there has been a lot of criticism in washington of the german government 's reluctance to step forward and play a stronger role . "
mitchell feels that the meeting in the white house wo n't be able to solve those differences , an argument gale mattox agrees with : " i think it will remain a point of contention , because we have taken very different approaches and i do n't see that we are either going to one side or to the other side . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama has reversed his predecessor 's environmental policy climate change will be another topic that will be discussed , but will likely remain unresolved .
analysts note that obama has reversed the bush policy on global warming and seems personally committed to adressing the issue .
but they point out that in the end any binding international agreement that obama signs will have to be ratified by congress .
in addition , it could be difficult for obama to press forward domestically on climate issues amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory .
still , says chrobog , even if obama can not go as far as the europeans want him to go on climate change , at least the us president and germany are now reading from the same page .

economic malaise the economic crisis will of course be another dominant issue for merkel and obama at the white house .
on this topic , argues mitchell , there could be some friction between both leaders .
" merkel and the german government clearly do n't look favorably on what the us federal reserve describes as loose monetary policy . "
merkel could use the problems the german government has with the american response to the economic crisis to point the finger at the united states as the main culprit for the global crisis , says mitchell .
but it 's not just the germans who may want to ruffle some feathers .
" i think when they meet , obama will press merkel to make a more positive contribution to solving the global crisis .
there has been a lot of criticism in washington of the german government 's reluctance to step forward and play a stronger role . "
mitchell feels that the meeting in the white house wo n't be able to solve those differences , an argument gale mattox agrees with : " i think it will remain a point of contention , because we have taken very different approaches and i do n't see that we are either going to one side or to the other side . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama has reversed his predecessor 's environmental policy climate change will be another topic that will be discussed , but will likely remain unresolved .
analysts note that obama has reversed the bush policy on global warming and seems personally committed to adressing the issue .
but they point out that in the end any binding international agreement that obama signs will have to be ratified by congress .
in addition , it could be difficult for obama to press forward domestically on climate issues amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory .
still , says chrobog , even if obama can not go as far as the europeans want him to go on climate change , at least the us president and germany are now reading from the same page .

analysts say the two may not agree on all issues but germany and the us are now on the same page . british prime minister gordon brown was the first major european leader to pay a visit to president barack obama in the white house .
that was back in march of this year , shortly after obama had been sworn in .
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was next in april , followed by french president nicholas sarkozy in june .
even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , embroiled in a major scandal back home in italy , was finally granted a meeting with obama in the white house in june .
only the leader of europe 's biggest economy , german chancellor angela merkel , has not yet visited the white house , sparking media speculations that relations between merkel and obama were cooler than with obama 's predecessor george w. bush . jürgen chrobog , a former german ambassador to the united states , thinks those rumors are without merit .
he points to the fact that merkel and obama have already met twice in germany .
" there was never much time to talk about things in detail , but at least they have met , they know each other and i think it 's now time to make a full official visit to the united states " , says chrobog and adds : " she could n't have waited longer . "
the timing is n't really of much significance , agrees wess mitchell , co-founder of the center for european policy analysis .
he also does n't believe that that the personal chemistry between the two leaders is markedly worse than the chemistry between merkel and bush was .

still , gale mattox , a germany expert and currently the fulbright-dow distinguished research chair of the roosevelt study center in the netherlands , says that after some hesitation obama this week came out quite strongly on iran as well .

mitchell feels that the meeting in the white house wo n't be able to solve those differences , an argument gale mattox agrees with : " i think it will remain a point of contention , because we have taken very different approaches and i do n't see that we are either going to one side or to the other side . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama has reversed his predecessor 's environmental policy climate change will be another topic that will be discussed , but will likely remain unresolved .
analysts note that obama has reversed the bush policy on global warming and seems personally committed to adressing the issue .
but they point out that in the end any binding international agreement that obama signs will have to be ratified by congress .
in addition , it could be difficult for obama to press forward domestically on climate issues amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory .
still , says chrobog , even if obama can not go as far as the europeans want him to go on climate change , at least the us president and germany are now reading from the same page .

the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .
a fourth defendant , pavel ryaguzov , a secret police agent , was acquitted in a separate trial for allegedly providing the killer with politkovskaya 's address . despite lasting almost four months , the original trial failed to shed any significant light on the circumstances of the killing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the original four suspects was the killer the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on october 7 , 2006 , has not been apprehended .

the new supreme court ruling means the verdict of the moscow district military court has been annulled and the criminal case referred back to the same court for a new hearing .
lawyers for the politkovskaya family said they did not agree with the case being thrown out , or with the order for a retrial , because the men charged had not been the real perpetrators of the crime .
" i think there should not be a repeat trial .
the case should be sent by the court for additional investigation , " politkovskaya 's son ilya said .
politkovskaya , who had been an award-winning investigative journalist for the novaya gazeta newspaper , wrote dozens of articles on human rights abuses in russia and published a book called " putin 's russia . "
in that book , she accused the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , of using the chechen conflict to strangle democracy , while detailing horrific rights abuses in chechnya .
her murder triggered an outcry in the international community and raised serious concerns about a surge in crackdowns against people critical of the kremlin and putin. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a fourth defendant , pavel ryaguzov , a secret police agent , was acquitted in a separate trial for allegedly providing the killer with politkovskaya 's address . despite lasting almost four months , the original trial failed to shed any significant light on the circumstances of the killing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the original four suspects was the killer the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on october 7 , 2006 , has not been apprehended .
rights groups have long criticized russia 's failure to bring to justice the person , or persons , responsible for the death of politkovskaya .
the new supreme court ruling means the verdict of the moscow district military court has been annulled and the criminal case referred back to the same court for a new hearing .
lawyers for the politkovskaya family said they did not agree with the case being thrown out , or with the order for a retrial , because the men charged had not been the real perpetrators of the crime .
" i think there should not be a repeat trial .
the case should be sent by the court for additional investigation , " politkovskaya 's son ilya said .
politkovskaya , who had been an award-winning investigative journalist for the novaya gazeta newspaper , wrote dozens of articles on human rights abuses in russia and published a book called " putin 's russia . "
in that book , she accused the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , of using the chechen conflict to strangle democracy , while detailing horrific rights abuses in chechnya .
her murder triggered an outcry in the international community and raised serious concerns about a surge in crackdowns against people critical of the kremlin and putin. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , at 100 , he encourages budding composers to follow their hearts . composer elliott carter is internationally recognized as one of the leading american voices of the classical music tradition .
one of the extraordinary features of carter 's career is his astonishing productivity and creative vitality as he embarks on his eleventh decade .
he has written more than 130 works and over 40 of these in the past decade alone . dw 's breandain o 'shea met with carter during the aldeburgh music festival in the uk , where a special program of his music was being presented to celebrate his 100th birthday . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview . deutsche welle : mr. carter , you spent a period of your life in germany - around 1964 , when you wrote your much celebrated piano concerto .
how did you come to germany and how important has german music been in your career ? elliott carter : it was a time when the ford foundation and the berliner senate got to together to start what i think was called the deutsche austauschdienst -lrb- german exchange program -rrb- and they invited a number of artists - wh orden was one , i ca n't remember the rest .
you could stay there for a year .
we had a very good and interesting time . i 'd had an interest in germany since i was in college in 1920 and 1930 .
i use to go to germany - munich - hoping to learn german , but instead ended up going to wagner and mozart operas at the prinzregententheater . so i never really learned german .
i was more interested in the music than the language .
it is a country that i have greatly admired in many , many ways .
after all , most of the music i am interested in is german .
it has been an important part of my life . literature has had an incredible influence on you : proust , james joyce , thomas mann and the poetry of elizabeth bishop .
you once said literature helped you discover important aspects of music that you did n't find in compositions .
what do you mean by that ? well , of course literature deals with the actual physical world and the world that we see .
music is an imaginary thing ; in some ways it deals with what seems to be feelings and thoughts .
literature is much more concerned with how we think about the world around us , while music is much more " innerlich " -lrb- internal -rrb- . what advice would you give young composers today ? young composers should always do what they love to do .
if they love to make money , that 's one way of writing music .
and the other one is if they like to write notes . is there a difference ? of course there is , because if you really want to make money then you have to write for a large public .
if you write notes then you have to write what you think is good and hope that other people will like it .
we are all composers that are a result of a good deal of training and that training consisted partly of understanding what audiences expect .
and so as a result , the relationship of the composer to the audience is a built-in thing when you become a professional . then , of course , it does n't mean that all the audience will like it . here we are all taught to write fugues - but then who in that audience will know what a fugue is ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.06.2009 birth control pill for men could be available soon , says who großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contraceptive reduces sperm count by up to 100 percent , say researchers women have been awaiting it for years , and , according to researchers , it looks like the pill for men is finally in sight .
the other good news is that is does n't seem to have any side-effects . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is currently testing a hormonal birth control pill for men .
michael zitzman , who is heading the study , told deutsche welle that it will likely be available to the public in 2012 at the earliest . deutsche welle : mr. zitzman , would you take the pill for men yourself ? prof. michael zitzman : yes , of course . why is everyone making such a big deal about this pill for men when it is n't even a pill ? it 's kind of like a product name , because the pill for women is so well known .
there 's never been an oral pill for men that can bring the same result as it does for women .
men have had to use shots , implants , and gels that are applied on the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael zitzmann heads the who study so how does the pill for men actually work ? with this hormonal form of contraception for men , natural testosterone is applied together with gestagen , which is a precursor of testosterone .
the goal is to completely suppress the hormones that stimulate the production of sperm in the testicles . how much testosterone and gestagen is needed ? the patient takes the dose that used for men who 've had a testicular disease , for example , and need to take replacement hormones .
they have to take extra testosterone to avoid side-effects like depression , osteoporoses or anaemia . is there a recommended dose ? 1,000 milligrams .
that 's about 1 gram of testosterone every two months . you 've said that sperm production is reduced by up to 100 percent .
but that 's not irreversible , is it ? no , of course not .
if that were the case then you might as well just have a vasectomy .
this method is completely reversible - that 's been the case with all the men tested .
it takes about four months , or sometimes only two , for the sperm to build up again . it takes the same amount of time for the sperm to disappear , since they go through a maturing process in the testicles .
once this process has begun , then their independent of the hormones .
that means that the sperm continue to develop without any hormones .
in the study , we noticed that after 4 weeks the sperm had disappeared in some of the men .
it usually takes two to four months , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pill will not affect appearance , say researchers does the additional testosterone change the man 's body in any way ?
testosterone is usually associated with muscles , body builders , and doping . it depends on dose of the hormone .
when a healthy man is given the same dose of testosterone that he would normally produce , then his body automatically reduces its own production of the hormone and the sperm count drops .
that means that his hormone levels do n't change and neither do his appearance or health . how far along is this study ?
the idea of a birth control pill for men has been around for a while now , and there have been lots of research projects … it has been around for a while .
the first thing we had to do was to figure out how everything works .
how well does it work and what are the side effects ?
the side effects that had been reported came from studies where placebos were used , which means some of the men received fake medication . the side-effects all resulted from placebo-niveau .
some of the men felt poorly or had trouble sleeping , but that probably had nothing to do with the actual medication .
it might have just been a side-effect of knowing they were taking part in a study , or it could also have just been a coincidence . so there are no side effects ? the only side-effect is that the testicles shrink a bit , because they stop working .
however , they return to their normal size when the men stop taking the pill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers do n't know if the pill for men appeals to couples when can we expect to see the birth control pill for men on the market ? that depends on how the pharmaceutical industry sees it and whether the world health organization receives a license .
i think that the study by the world health organization will be successful since we already know from past studies that it works . what we still need to find out is what couples think of this method .
do they feel good about it ?
i ca n't answer that just yet , because we still need to find the answer to that .
we think that , if everything goes well , the pill could be on the market as early as 2012 or 2013 . is the pharmaceutical industry interested ? yes , because the substances that are needed for the pill are already on the market .
they 've been permitted for other uses and the authorities would just have to approve them for the pill for men .
then the industry could put it on the market relatively quickly . interview : judith hartl -lrb- km -rrb- edited by : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the other good news is that is does n't seem to have any side-effects . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is currently testing a hormonal birth control pill for men .
michael zitzman , who is heading the study , told deutsche welle that it will likely be available to the public in 2012 at the earliest . deutsche welle : mr. zitzman , would you take the pill for men yourself ? prof. michael zitzman : yes , of course . why is everyone making such a big deal about this pill for men when it is n't even a pill ? it 's kind of like a product name , because the pill for women is so well known .
there 's never been an oral pill for men that can bring the same result as it does for women .
men have had to use shots , implants , and gels that are applied on the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael zitzmann heads the who study so how does the pill for men actually work ? with this hormonal form of contraception for men , natural testosterone is applied together with gestagen , which is a precursor of testosterone .
the goal is to completely suppress the hormones that stimulate the production of sperm in the testicles . how much testosterone and gestagen is needed ? the patient takes the dose that used for men who 've had a testicular disease , for example , and need to take replacement hormones .
they have to take extra testosterone to avoid side-effects like depression , osteoporoses or anaemia . is there a recommended dose ? 1,000 milligrams .
that 's about 1 gram of testosterone every two months . you 've said that sperm production is reduced by up to 100 percent .
but that 's not irreversible , is it ? no , of course not .
if that were the case then you might as well just have a vasectomy .
this method is completely reversible - that 's been the case with all the men tested .
it takes about four months , or sometimes only two , for the sperm to build up again . it takes the same amount of time for the sperm to disappear , since they go through a maturing process in the testicles .
once this process has begun , then their independent of the hormones .
that means that the sperm continue to develop without any hormones .
in the study , we noticed that after 4 weeks the sperm had disappeared in some of the men .
it usually takes two to four months , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pill will not affect appearance , say researchers does the additional testosterone change the man 's body in any way ?
testosterone is usually associated with muscles , body builders , and doping . it depends on dose of the hormone .
when a healthy man is given the same dose of testosterone that he would normally produce , then his body automatically reduces its own production of the hormone and the sperm count drops .
that means that his hormone levels do n't change and neither do his appearance or health . how far along is this study ?
the idea of a birth control pill for men has been around for a while now , and there have been lots of research projects … it has been around for a while .
the first thing we had to do was to figure out how everything works .
how well does it work and what are the side effects ?
the side effects that had been reported came from studies where placebos were used , which means some of the men received fake medication . the side-effects all resulted from placebo-niveau .
some of the men felt poorly or had trouble sleeping , but that probably had nothing to do with the actual medication .
it might have just been a side-effect of knowing they were taking part in a study , or it could also have just been a coincidence . so there are no side effects ? the only side-effect is that the testicles shrink a bit , because they stop working .
however , they return to their normal size when the men stop taking the pill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers do n't know if the pill for men appeals to couples when can we expect to see the birth control pill for men on the market ? that depends on how the pharmaceutical industry sees it and whether the world health organization receives a license .
i think that the study by the world health organization will be successful since we already know from past studies that it works . what we still need to find out is what couples think of this method .
do they feel good about it ?
i ca n't answer that just yet , because we still need to find the answer to that .
we think that , if everything goes well , the pill could be on the market as early as 2012 or 2013 . is the pharmaceutical industry interested ? yes , because the substances that are needed for the pill are already on the market .
they 've been permitted for other uses and the authorities would just have to approve them for the pill for men .
then the industry could put it on the market relatively quickly . interview : judith hartl -lrb- km -rrb- edited by : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delegates are also to discuss a destruction verification process and greater transparency by signatories on how many cluster munitions they hold .
since the convention on cluster munitions was adopted in december 2008 in oslo , 98 countries have signed the document and 11 have already ratified it .
signatory states have eight years to destroy military stockpiles of cluster weapons , once the convention comes into effect six months after it has been ratified by thirty states .
germany to ratify cluster bomb treaty opening the conference in berlin on thursday , german deputy foreign minister gernot erler announced that his country had become the 11th nation to ratify the convention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 10 percent of cluster bomb submunitions do not explode , posing a threat to civilians " i ’ m confident that the 30 countries required for the convention to come into effect , will be reached in 2010 by the latest " , he said . " cluster munitions are among the most problematic and vicious types of ammunition used in contemporary warfare .
the long-term effects of their use are disastrous , " erler said .
" we see a new momentum in nuclear disarmament , and commend our american partners for their new approach .
let us hope ... that this momentum will also be extended to conventional disarmament , " he added .
a number of countries - including among others the united states , china , israel , india , russia , pakistan and georgia - refuse to sign up to the convention , and have chosen to stay away from the berlin conference .
" weapon of cowards " a cluster bomb is a weapon fired by artillery or dropped by aircraft .
it contains multiple , often hundreds , of small explosive submunitions , or bomblets .
military experts describe cluster munition as " the weapon of cowards " as they can wipe out large numbers of troops without engaging them directly on the ground .
frequently these bomblets fail to explode immediately and can lie dormant for many years , killing and maiming civilians long after the conflict is over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wheelchair-bound cluster bomb survivors in dublin protest against the use of the weapons according to a 2006 report by human rights group handicap international , there have been at least 13,000 confirmed post-conflict cluster bomb casualties , but the actual number of unreported deaths may be as high as 100,000 .
rights groups say , cluster munition was most recently deployed in georgia ’ s war with russia in 2008 , israel ’ s bombardement of southern lebanon in 2006 , as well as by the united states in iraq 2003 and in afghanistan in 2001 .
hard to destroy under the convention , signatories are requested to destroy their cluster munition arsenals within eight years after the treaty will have come into effect .
it also requires clearing areas of unexploded submunitions within 10 years .
from the 98 signatories , only spain has so far completed the destruction of its cluster munition arsenal .
erler told the conference that germany began destroying its cluster bomb stockpile in 2001 . " we ’ ve since aquired substantial technical know-how , which we are willing to share with others , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cluster bomb being decomissioned at the spreewerke luebben plant in eastern germany but gert wickede , ceo of the spreewerk lübben company , told deutsche welle this week that cluster munition " is just not designed for being decomissioned . "
the company , based in eastern germany , has specialized in the destruction of cluster munitions .
" the fuse of this munition is highly sensitive which is why it 's complicate to defuse , " wickede said .
the huge number of submunitions contained in a cluster bomb , would also pose a major challenge , he added .
call on us , china and russia on the eve of the berlin conference , human rights groups and german political leaders called on especially the united states , china and russia to join the convention .
claudia roth , the co-leader of germany ’ s opposition green party , called for chancellor angela merkel to urge us president barack obama to sign the treaty during her trip to washington starting on thursday .
roth told reporters in berlin that merkel should seize the " wind of change " president obama had brought to the white house .
steve goose , director of the arms division of human rights watch , said he hoped the conference would " push foward the momentum , " and encourage more nations to join and ratify the treaty .

now , at 100 , he encourages budding composers to follow their hearts . composer elliott carter is internationally recognized as one of the leading american voices of the classical music tradition .
one of the extraordinary features of carter 's career is his astonishing productivity and creative vitality as he embarks on his eleventh decade .
he has written more than 130 works and over 40 of these in the past decade alone . dw 's breandain o 'shea met with carter during the aldeburgh music festival in the uk , where a special program of his music was being presented to celebrate his 100th birthday . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview . deutsche welle : mr. carter , you spent a period of your life in germany - around 1964 , when you wrote your much celebrated piano concerto .
how did you come to germany and how important has german music been in your career ? elliott carter : it was a time when the ford foundation and the berliner senate got to together to start what i think was called the deutsche austauschdienst -lrb- german exchange program -rrb- and they invited a number of artists - wh orden was one , i ca n't remember the rest .
you could stay there for a year .
we had a very good and interesting time . i 'd had an interest in germany since i was in college in 1920 and 1930 .
i use to go to germany - munich - hoping to learn german , but instead ended up going to wagner and mozart operas at the prinzregententheater . so i never really learned german .
i was more interested in the music than the language .
it is a country that i have greatly admired in many , many ways .
after all , most of the music i am interested in is german .
it has been an important part of my life . literature has had an incredible influence on you : proust , james joyce , thomas mann and the poetry of elizabeth bishop .
you once said literature helped you discover important aspects of music that you did n't find in compositions .
what do you mean by that ? well , of course literature deals with the actual physical world and the world that we see .
music is an imaginary thing ; in some ways it deals with what seems to be feelings and thoughts .
literature is much more concerned with how we think about the world around us , while music is much more " innerlich " -lrb- internal -rrb- . what advice would you give young composers today ? young composers should always do what they love to do .
if they love to make money , that 's one way of writing music .
and the other one is if they like to write notes . is there a difference ? of course there is , because if you really want to make money then you have to write for a large public .
if you write notes then you have to write what you think is good and hope that other people will like it .
we are all composers that are a result of a good deal of training and that training consisted partly of understanding what audiences expect .
and so as a result , the relationship of the composer to the audience is a built-in thing when you become a professional . then , of course , it does n't mean that all the audience will like it . here we are all taught to write fugues - but then who in that audience will know what a fugue is ?

munich gives the go-ahead , berlin says not so fast , but this winter 's catalog is off to the printers . the bavarian government said on wednesday that representatives from the federal government and the states of bavaria and saxony had agreed to provide quelle with loans worth 50 million euros .
" this decision makes it clear that quelle can continue , " said bavarian finance minister georg fahrenschon .
the proposed assistance still needs to be reviewed by the european union 's competition watch dog in brussels , but fahrenschon said " a start had been made . "
the announcement was welcome news for the company 's 8,000 employees , located mostly in bavaria and saxony .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcandor is also the parent to the troubled department store chain karstadt that is , until berlin cast doubt on the agreement .
federal finance minister peer steinbrueck told a press conference later on wednesday that quelle would have to review its application for assistance .
he gave the company until tuesday to accept conditions in return for 25 million euros of federal funds . he added that an inter-ministerial committee had rejected the idea of loan-guarantees for quelle because the company was too indebted .
steinbrueck explained that direct loans would be preferable to the state , because it would be entitled to claw back money if quelle entered insolvency . despite the mixed signals , quelle 's winter catalog , which features everything from underwear to washing machines , appears to have the go ahead . the company was under pressure to meet a printing deadline , but bavarian premier horst seehofer is expected to present a sample catalogue to printing contractors in a public display of confidence at quelle 's distribution headquarters in nuremberg on thursday . quelle 's parent company , arcandor , which also owns the karstadt department store chain , declared bankruptcy earlier in june after failing to obtain 650 million euros in loan guarantees and 437 million euros in emergency credit from the federal government. nw / reuters / ap / afp editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.06.2009 birth control pill for men could be available soon , says who großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contraceptive reduces sperm count by up to 100 percent , say researchers women have been awaiting it for years , and , according to researchers , it looks like the pill for men is finally in sight .
the other good news is that is does n't seem to have any side-effects . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is currently testing a hormonal birth control pill for men .
michael zitzman , who is heading the study , told deutsche welle that it will likely be available to the public in 2012 at the earliest . deutsche welle : mr. zitzman , would you take the pill for men yourself ? prof. michael zitzman : yes , of course . why is everyone making such a big deal about this pill for men when it is n't even a pill ? it 's kind of like a product name , because the pill for women is so well known .
there 's never been an oral pill for men that can bring the same result as it does for women .
men have had to use shots , implants , and gels that are applied on the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael zitzmann heads the who study so how does the pill for men actually work ? with this hormonal form of contraception for men , natural testosterone is applied together with gestagen , which is a precursor of testosterone .
the goal is to completely suppress the hormones that stimulate the production of sperm in the testicles . how much testosterone and gestagen is needed ? the patient takes the dose that used for men who 've had a testicular disease , for example , and need to take replacement hormones .
they have to take extra testosterone to avoid side-effects like depression , osteoporoses or anaemia . is there a recommended dose ? 1,000 milligrams .
that 's about 1 gram of testosterone every two months . you 've said that sperm production is reduced by up to 100 percent .
but that 's not irreversible , is it ? no , of course not .
if that were the case then you might as well just have a vasectomy .
this method is completely reversible - that 's been the case with all the men tested .
it takes about four months , or sometimes only two , for the sperm to build up again . it takes the same amount of time for the sperm to disappear , since they go through a maturing process in the testicles .
once this process has begun , then their independent of the hormones .
that means that the sperm continue to develop without any hormones .
in the study , we noticed that after 4 weeks the sperm had disappeared in some of the men .
it usually takes two to four months , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pill will not affect appearance , say researchers does the additional testosterone change the man 's body in any way ?
testosterone is usually associated with muscles , body builders , and doping . it depends on dose of the hormone .
when a healthy man is given the same dose of testosterone that he would normally produce , then his body automatically reduces its own production of the hormone and the sperm count drops .
that means that his hormone levels do n't change and neither do his appearance or health . how far along is this study ?
the idea of a birth control pill for men has been around for a while now , and there have been lots of research projects … it has been around for a while .
the first thing we had to do was to figure out how everything works .
how well does it work and what are the side effects ?
the side effects that had been reported came from studies where placebos were used , which means some of the men received fake medication . the side-effects all resulted from placebo-niveau .
some of the men felt poorly or had trouble sleeping , but that probably had nothing to do with the actual medication .
it might have just been a side-effect of knowing they were taking part in a study , or it could also have just been a coincidence . so there are no side effects ? the only side-effect is that the testicles shrink a bit , because they stop working .
however , they return to their normal size when the men stop taking the pill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers do n't know if the pill for men appeals to couples when can we expect to see the birth control pill for men on the market ? that depends on how the pharmaceutical industry sees it and whether the world health organization receives a license .
i think that the study by the world health organization will be successful since we already know from past studies that it works . what we still need to find out is what couples think of this method .
do they feel good about it ?
i ca n't answer that just yet , because we still need to find the answer to that .
we think that , if everything goes well , the pill could be on the market as early as 2012 or 2013 . is the pharmaceutical industry interested ? yes , because the substances that are needed for the pill are already on the market .
they 've been permitted for other uses and the authorities would just have to approve them for the pill for men .
then the industry could put it on the market relatively quickly . interview : judith hartl -lrb- km -rrb- edited by : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have to take extra testosterone to avoid side-effects like depression , osteoporoses or anaemia . is there a recommended dose ? 1,000 milligrams .
that 's about 1 gram of testosterone every two months . you 've said that sperm production is reduced by up to 100 percent .
but that 's not irreversible , is it ? no , of course not .
if that were the case then you might as well just have a vasectomy .
this method is completely reversible - that 's been the case with all the men tested .
it takes about four months , or sometimes only two , for the sperm to build up again . it takes the same amount of time for the sperm to disappear , since they go through a maturing process in the testicles .
once this process has begun , then their independent of the hormones .
that means that the sperm continue to develop without any hormones .
in the study , we noticed that after 4 weeks the sperm had disappeared in some of the men .
it usually takes two to four months , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pill will not affect appearance , say researchers does the additional testosterone change the man 's body in any way ?
testosterone is usually associated with muscles , body builders , and doping . it depends on dose of the hormone .
when a healthy man is given the same dose of testosterone that he would normally produce , then his body automatically reduces its own production of the hormone and the sperm count drops .
that means that his hormone levels do n't change and neither do his appearance or health . how far along is this study ?
the idea of a birth control pill for men has been around for a while now , and there have been lots of research projects … it has been around for a while .
the first thing we had to do was to figure out how everything works .
how well does it work and what are the side effects ?
the side effects that had been reported came from studies where placebos were used , which means some of the men received fake medication . the side-effects all resulted from placebo-niveau .
some of the men felt poorly or had trouble sleeping , but that probably had nothing to do with the actual medication .
it might have just been a side-effect of knowing they were taking part in a study , or it could also have just been a coincidence . so there are no side effects ? the only side-effect is that the testicles shrink a bit , because they stop working .
however , they return to their normal size when the men stop taking the pill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers do n't know if the pill for men appeals to couples when can we expect to see the birth control pill for men on the market ? that depends on how the pharmaceutical industry sees it and whether the world health organization receives a license .
i think that the study by the world health organization will be successful since we already know from past studies that it works . what we still need to find out is what couples think of this method .
do they feel good about it ?
i ca n't answer that just yet , because we still need to find the answer to that .
we think that , if everything goes well , the pill could be on the market as early as 2012 or 2013 . is the pharmaceutical industry interested ? yes , because the substances that are needed for the pill are already on the market .
they 've been permitted for other uses and the authorities would just have to approve them for the pill for men .
then the industry could put it on the market relatively quickly . interview : judith hartl -lrb- km -rrb- edited by : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delegates are also to discuss a destruction verification process and greater transparency by signatories on how many cluster munitions they hold .
since the convention on cluster munitions was adopted in december 2008 in oslo , 98 countries have signed the document and 11 have already ratified it .
signatory states have eight years to destroy military stockpiles of cluster weapons , once the convention comes into effect six months after it has been ratified by thirty states .
germany to ratify cluster bomb treaty opening the conference in berlin on thursday , german deputy foreign minister gernot erler announced that his country had become the 11th nation to ratify the convention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 10 percent of cluster bomb submunitions do not explode , posing a threat to civilians " i ’ m confident that the 30 countries required for the convention to come into effect , will be reached in 2010 by the latest " , he said . " cluster munitions are among the most problematic and vicious types of ammunition used in contemporary warfare .
the long-term effects of their use are disastrous , " erler said .
" we see a new momentum in nuclear disarmament , and commend our american partners for their new approach .
let us hope ... that this momentum will also be extended to conventional disarmament , " he added .
a number of countries - including among others the united states , china , israel , india , russia , pakistan and georgia - refuse to sign up to the convention , and have chosen to stay away from the berlin conference .
" weapon of cowards " a cluster bomb is a weapon fired by artillery or dropped by aircraft .
it contains multiple , often hundreds , of small explosive submunitions , or bomblets .
military experts describe cluster munition as " the weapon of cowards " as they can wipe out large numbers of troops without engaging them directly on the ground .
frequently these bomblets fail to explode immediately and can lie dormant for many years , killing and maiming civilians long after the conflict is over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wheelchair-bound cluster bomb survivors in dublin protest against the use of the weapons according to a 2006 report by human rights group handicap international , there have been at least 13,000 confirmed post-conflict cluster bomb casualties , but the actual number of unreported deaths may be as high as 100,000 .
rights groups say , cluster munition was most recently deployed in georgia ’ s war with russia in 2008 , israel ’ s bombardement of southern lebanon in 2006 , as well as by the united states in iraq 2003 and in afghanistan in 2001 .
hard to destroy under the convention , signatories are requested to destroy their cluster munition arsenals within eight years after the treaty will have come into effect .
it also requires clearing areas of unexploded submunitions within 10 years .
from the 98 signatories , only spain has so far completed the destruction of its cluster munition arsenal .
erler told the conference that germany began destroying its cluster bomb stockpile in 2001 . " we ’ ve since aquired substantial technical know-how , which we are willing to share with others , " he added .

delegates are also to discuss a destruction verification process and greater transparency by signatories on how many cluster munitions they hold .
since the convention on cluster munitions was adopted in december 2008 in oslo , 98 countries have signed the document and 11 have already ratified it .
signatory states have eight years to destroy military stockpiles of cluster weapons , once the convention comes into effect six months after it has been ratified by thirty states .
germany to ratify cluster bomb treaty opening the conference in berlin on thursday , german deputy foreign minister gernot erler announced that his country had become the 11th nation to ratify the convention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 10 percent of cluster bomb submunitions do not explode , posing a threat to civilians " i ’ m confident that the 30 countries required for the convention to come into effect , will be reached in 2010 by the latest " , he said . " cluster munitions are among the most problematic and vicious types of ammunition used in contemporary warfare .
the long-term effects of their use are disastrous , " erler said .
" we see a new momentum in nuclear disarmament , and commend our american partners for their new approach .
let us hope ... that this momentum will also be extended to conventional disarmament , " he added .
a number of countries - including among others the united states , china , israel , india , russia , pakistan and georgia - refuse to sign up to the convention , and have chosen to stay away from the berlin conference .
" weapon of cowards " a cluster bomb is a weapon fired by artillery or dropped by aircraft .
it contains multiple , often hundreds , of small explosive submunitions , or bomblets .
military experts describe cluster munition as " the weapon of cowards " as they can wipe out large numbers of troops without engaging them directly on the ground .
frequently these bomblets fail to explode immediately and can lie dormant for many years , killing and maiming civilians long after the conflict is over .

we had a very good and interesting time . i 'd had an interest in germany since i was in college in 1920 and 1930 .
i use to go to germany - munich - hoping to learn german , but instead ended up going to wagner and mozart operas at the prinzregententheater . so i never really learned german .

what do you mean by that ? well , of course literature deals with the actual physical world and the world that we see .
music is an imaginary thing ; in some ways it deals with what seems to be feelings and thoughts .

if you write notes then you have to write what you think is good and hope that other people will like it .
we are all composers that are a result of a good deal of training and that training consisted partly of understanding what audiences expect .

now , at 100 , he encourages budding composers to follow their hearts . composer elliott carter is internationally recognized as one of the leading american voices of the classical music tradition .
one of the extraordinary features of carter 's career is his astonishing productivity and creative vitality as he embarks on his eleventh decade .
he has written more than 130 works and over 40 of these in the past decade alone . dw 's breandain o 'shea met with carter during the aldeburgh music festival in the uk , where a special program of his music was being presented to celebrate his 100th birthday . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview . deutsche welle : mr. carter , you spent a period of your life in germany - around 1964 , when you wrote your much celebrated piano concerto .
how did you come to germany and how important has german music been in your career ? elliott carter : it was a time when the ford foundation and the berliner senate got to together to start what i think was called the deutsche austauschdienst -lrb- german exchange program -rrb- and they invited a number of artists - wh orden was one , i ca n't remember the rest .
you could stay there for a year .
we had a very good and interesting time . i 'd had an interest in germany since i was in college in 1920 and 1930 .
i use to go to germany - munich - hoping to learn german , but instead ended up going to wagner and mozart operas at the prinzregententheater . so i never really learned german .
i was more interested in the music than the language .
it is a country that i have greatly admired in many , many ways .
after all , most of the music i am interested in is german .
it has been an important part of my life . literature has had an incredible influence on you : proust , james joyce , thomas mann and the poetry of elizabeth bishop .
you once said literature helped you discover important aspects of music that you did n't find in compositions .
what do you mean by that ? well , of course literature deals with the actual physical world and the world that we see .
music is an imaginary thing ; in some ways it deals with what seems to be feelings and thoughts .
literature is much more concerned with how we think about the world around us , while music is much more " innerlich " -lrb- internal -rrb- . what advice would you give young composers today ? young composers should always do what they love to do .
if they love to make money , that 's one way of writing music .
and the other one is if they like to write notes . is there a difference ? of course there is , because if you really want to make money then you have to write for a large public .
if you write notes then you have to write what you think is good and hope that other people will like it .
we are all composers that are a result of a good deal of training and that training consisted partly of understanding what audiences expect .
and so as a result , the relationship of the composer to the audience is a built-in thing when you become a professional . then , of course , it does n't mean that all the audience will like it . here we are all taught to write fugues - but then who in that audience will know what a fugue is ?

" the presidency regrets the fact that despite determined efforts and numerous attempts by the presidency and the european commission there has been no progress in the accession talks , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement . croatia had hoped to conclude eu entry talks by the end of the year , but that that now looks like an unlikely prospect . eu member slovenia has blocked croatia 's entry talks , arguing that they are prejudicial to the outcome of the two countries ' border dispute , which centers around the coastal town of piran and access rights to the adriatic sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carl bildt says croatia and slovenia need time to reflect sweden , which takes over the eu presidency in july , said this week it plans no fresh attempt to help settle the row , which swedish foreign minister carl bildt called a bilateral issue .
he said it was time for a " period of reflection " in both countries . on tuesday , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn offered croatia a last-ditch attempt to put its eu aspirations back on track .
he said it was still possible for croatia to reach the final phase of negotiations by the end of the year , if the border talks were resolved , and croatia implemented necessary reforms . nrt / afp / dpa editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 25.06.2009 eu takes legal action against germany over farm subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say recipients of agricultural subsidies in germany are n't just farmers but big corporations the european commission has officially opened legal proceedings against germany over the southern state of bavaria 's failure to publish data on the recipients of eu agricultural subsidies . in a letter sent to berlin on thursday , the commission said it was forced to take legal action against germany because the southern german state of bavaria had failed to comply with eu rules on agricultural subsidies . " under these circumstances the commission has no alternative but open legal proceedings against germany , " the eu commission said in a statement . following a 2006 eu decision – also carried by germany – all data on the recipients of agricultural subsidies must be published on the internet since the beginning of may . germany , which receives about 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- in agricultural subisidies from brussels each year , was the last country in the 27-nation eu to publish the names of beneficiaries of farm aid with a six-week delay in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers have a powerful lobby in germany , especially those from bavaria however , bavaria – a german state that has a powerful farmers lobby and a long history of antagonizing berlin and brussels - has been withholding data on the grounds that brussels ' demands were in breach of data protection laws , sparking a legal battle with the eu judiciary .
the bavarian agricultural ministry said it would withhold data on bavarian farmers until the european court has ruled on the legality of the move .
germany now has a month to respond before brussels takes further steps , which could result in a court case at the european court of justice and heavy fines . milking the eu cash cow the issue of agricultural subsidies has been a touchy business for decades , but recently things came to a head when it emerged that some recipients in germany are not farmers in the traditional sense , but millionaires , big corporations , or even organizations that have no links to agriculture . reinhild benning , an activist with the german environmental group bund , has taken a closer look at how the eu farm aid has been spent in germany . she found out that the german airline , lufthansa , has been receiving subsidies for dairy products it serves its passengers on transcontinental flights .

tuebingen has set itself the goal of reducing green house gas emissions by 10 percent by 2010 , and by 70 percent by 2020 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign includes posters put up all over town the climate protection campaign , called " tuebingen is going blue " is the brainchild of mayor boris palmer , a member of the greens , who said that almost every decision made during an average day has an effect on the climate . and he does mean everything : from how you choose to travel to work , to whether you prefer to take a shower or a bath , to whether or not you eat meat . " it all has implications for the climate , " he said , " and we ask people to consider what they are doing and to act to save the climate . " going blue to be green a play on the german expression of skipping out on work or school that literally translates to " going blue , " the " tuebingen is going blue " is a highly visible marketing campaign that organizers said aims to draw attention to the myriad ways the town 's inhabitants can save energy .
using energy saving lamps , turning off appliances at the source , or buying regional and seasonal products are just some of the organizers ' tips . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the town 's green energy comes from a hydroelectric power plant the campaign also serves as a one-stop-shop for finding out about climate-friendly schemes on offer in the town , such as car-sharing and financing for energy-efficient heat-pumps . some of the strategies promoted - like covering the town-owned smart car mayor palmer sometimes drives in campaign posters and having a link to the campaign 's web site in every e-mail sent by public officials - are simple , but effective , according to sabine schmincke , the head of tuebingen 's communication department . nothing 's more difficult than changing people 's behavior so you have to use a whole range of marketing strategies for a campaign like this to be successful , schmincke said . " in order to get an impact on climatic change , what we really have to do is change everybody 's behavior , so it 's worthwhile to make a good effort in marketing in order to reach as many people as possible , " she added . success so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town of tübingen has covered the outside of the paul-horn-arena with solar panels to create green energy the campaign seems to be working .
since its launch just over a year ago , for example , there 's been a 75 percent leap in the number of households who have signed up for green power .
ortwin wiebecke , the director of the town 's public utility company , stadtwerke tuebingen said he believes this is all thanks to raising public awareness . plus , green power costs more , which has been very helpful to the city , wiebecke said . " because all those people pay a little extra and we can use this extra for building new facilities for regenerative power production , " he added . producing green energy of course it is n't just about using green energy , but about producing it as well .
which is exactly what the local high school is doing . elke weiler , the chairperson of the parents ' association at the school , together with teacher martin merkle , founded a citizen 's group to fund two solar plants located on the school 's roof .
the plants feed a combined 60 kwp into the net . projects like this that have led to the photovoltaic power capacity of tuebingen doubling in the year since the campaign launched .
palmer said he believes this is because the council is not only marketing renewable energy sources ; it is making it easy for inhabitants to invest in solar energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a rare thing to have a mayor who rides his bike to work the town has set up a solar roofing market and provides a one-time subsidy for new plants that are n't eligible for funding from the german government or european union . the campaign won tuebingen a german environment agency 's prize for its comprehensive marketing strategy .
but palmer is determined to see current emissions reduced from eight tons per capita a year , to three tons by 2020 . and tuebingen 's mayor certainly puts his money where his mouth is .
he does n't own a car or even a fridge .
he has a solar panel on his roof and cooks with gas .
and he is probably one of the few mayors in the country with a bicycle parked outside the town hall - with a blue bike helmet hanging from the handle . author : kate hairsine -lrb- mrm -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is our first time to be in the final of a major competition , so obviously we 're thrilled . "

the us squad will now face brazil , the winner of thursday 's semifinal against south africa . the united states scored its greatest win in almost 60 years by beating european champions spain to reach the final of the confederations cup .
a first-half strike from villareal 's jozy altidore and another goal 16 minutes from time by fulham 's clint dempsey did the damage in what will go down as one of the biggest victories in us soccer history .
" this win is huge for american soccer , " said man of the match dempsey .
" this is our first time to be in the final of a major competition , so obviously we 're thrilled . "
spain is currently ranked as the world 's best team by fifa , the governing body of world soccer .
but for spain the defeat was even more painful as it ended a record of 15 consecutive wins and also prevented them from surpassing brazil 's record of 35-match unbeaten runs .
spain had not been defeated since going down 1-0 in a friendly to romania in november 2006 .
us faces brazil in sunday 's final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few had expected the us could throw out the favorites " a lot of people did n't think we could do this , " us defender oguchi onyewu said after the game .
" but we showed our heart , our grit and our resilience .
it 's a huge achievement for us .
i bet there were n't a lot of people in europe and around the world that would have bet on this . "
even spanish striker fernando torres was forced to admit that his side was up against a more-than-worthy opponent .
" they have fantastic players and a strong team , and maybe by beating spain and breaking our streak people will start to recognize that . "
the result was even more remarkable because the us had lost their opening two group matches in the competition and were heading out until they beat egypt 3-0 on sunday .
after brazil had sunk italy by the same score , the us only squeezed through on the numbers of goals scored .
however , the match ended in bittersweet agony for the us when michael bradley , after a brilliant game in midfield , was sent off three minutes from time .
he will now miss sunday 's final against brazil , which beat south africa in the other semi-final thursday night. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " more information : boozing to oblivion - alcohol abuse amongst young people on the internet the latest report by the federal commissioner on drugs in germany raised widespread concern here .
more than 23,000 young people had to be treated for alcohol poisoning in german hospitals last year .
binge drinking is becoming increasingly popular .
and not only that , many young people are now also filming their excessive drinking and posting it on the internet .
experts are warning of the copycat effect , and many involved in youth welfare are calling for such websites to be blocked .
the federal center for health education has launched a huge campaign this week aimed at discouraging alcohol abuse .
our question is : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " herbert fuchs , finland , says both nature and nurture matter : " this question is tough to answer .
many children and young people grow up in an environment marked by indescribable poverty – in the high-rises and backyards of the big city , where nothing works anymore and even the landlord is out of work .
where the unemployed parents and neighbors pass the time , the endlessly long days with no positive prospects for the future – that ’ s where life is more than difficult to bear .
yes , and in public and school life , these young people bear their dammed-up fury in a new way – resorting to senseless boozing and violence against others – the way they see and experience it in their nearby surroundings on a daily basis .
for these youth , the experience of success is what ’ s missing most , of being able to do something , for example , to play an instrument or have a hobby .
and academic achievements no longer count in a place where everything has gone haywire .
it ’ s a vicious cycle , and alcohol is the final nail that they can cling to .
the negative side of globalization – which we ’ ve all been made to believe will bring us prosperity – a future – is a revolution that is putting society in the poorhouse .
teenage binge drinking is the best example of that , of our unraveling society .
not until people are able to find work and bread will many a family be able to live in peace without boozing ...
these young people need role models – among them , their parents and everything that comes along with a peaceful coexistence . "
germany ’ s hannelore krause supports a multi-pronged approach : " i think that it ’ s not just poverty and frustration that drive young people to drinking .
more often it ’ s considered cool for young people today to test their strength by guzzling alcohol like water in a drive to prove that they ’ re finally grown up .
as long as it ’ s easy for youth to get their hands on alcohol – whether it ’ s from a parent ’ s house , the gas station , the grocery or wherever – alcohol abuse will be impossible to stop .
tough punishments are necessary from those who procure alcohol for minors and young people – regardless of the form it takes and how strong it is .
and : parents need to take responsibility for their children .
taking steps to explain the consequences of alcohol consumption should start at home with the parents and continue in the classroom , where teachers must also address the fact that alcohol creates not just highs and lows but also destroys one ’ s illusions – as happens with binge drinking – and can lead to death .
the internet , too , must guard against posts glorifying alcohol abuse . "
rolf bockmühl of the philippines blames the media – and government : " i think not !
our society and its families are falling apart .
solidarity , insofar as us older folks know it , hardly exists anymore ...
alcohol is too cheap , consumption is on the rise .
boozing is almost normal .
magazines , newspapers and television show people drinking and smoking far too often -lrb- and dw-tv deserves some of the blame -rrb- .
any kind of warning comes too late because young people don ’ t promote any kind of abstinence from alcohol and cigarettes in their cliques .
in such groups -lrb- as my grandchildren like to tell their grandfather -rrb- , the popular ones are those who are " strong . "
being strong means " heavy drinking and heavy bragging , " especially in public , if possible .
unlimited drinking is just one part of my concern .
unfortunately , many families are also at fault because they don ’ t provide children with role models .
as adolescents , we drank alcohol , too .
due to financial reasons , though , just a little .
we also didn ’ t have the time for it .
six-day weeks were normal , as was overtime .
then there was the sports club .
that was it .
we don ’ t want to have to go through tough times like that again .
i don ’ t begrudge today ’ s youth of their freedom and free time .
it ’ s just – where , when and how have families and society adjusted to rapid consumption and the fast-paced internet era ?
what do schools have to say ?
both of my school-aged children came to learn to value free time , both during and in addition to their studies .
the pressure to perform set in during exam week , but that ’ s it .
evening excursions ended all too often – in my opinion – and for the ladies , too , in various stages of drunkenness .
such were the " freedoms " of the students , whose parents were happy to pay for everything .
did we spoil our children with the " good " in life ?
that ’ s what i ask myself today .
stricter laws hardly help .
penalties don ’ t help , either .
i think that families and families alone are the ones able to instill values in their children .
can families from the so-called " impoverished " classes achieve that , too ?
there ’ s a big problem here .
why is the government letting so many people fall by the wayside ?
that ’ s something the government is at risk of doing ...
the bottom line : i don ’ t see any clear way of tackling this problem .
it ’ s humiliating for me – i feel helpless .
where is our society headed ? "
gerhard seeger , also of the philippines , supports a smarter kind of information campaign : " bans on alcohol are useless – otherwise the problem wouldn ’ t exist .
alcohol abuse can only be stopped by young people themselves , insofar as they understand what it does to them and that this kind of binge drinking is disgusting .
sure , they ’ re young people , but they ’ re not little kids anymore .
there ’ s already plenty of information out there on the dangers of the " drug " alcohol , but it could stand to be stepped up in a targeted way .
and manufacturers should print warnings in ads and on bottles – every kind of container – that highlight alcohol ’ s dangers , not just to one ’ s own health , but to others as well . "
lee davis of the united states sees the economic crisis as a cause : " the short answer : probably not .
you need to remember that young people follow the example of their parents .
children are bothered by the recession , too .
when the economy improves , binge drinking should subside . "
syria ’ s mohanad mahli says " just saying no " doesn ’ t work : " i am against a ban on alcohol for young people .
that just makes alcohol more attractive .
breaking the law has its own kind of appeal ! "
rené junghans of brazil contends that alcohol abuse reflects parental lapses : " the abuse of alcohol by teenagers can very well be stopped through comprehensive education .
when young people post instances of their binge drinking all over the internet , the state should add appropriate posts to blogs that clearly point out the dangers of alcohol abuse .
in other respects , the situation shows a clear failure by parents who have neglected to raise their children with the necessary amount of love and security .
the children of parents who abandon their offspring are in search of an alternative to bury their frustrations .
children who feel safe and loved by their parents resort neither to alcohol nor to drugs .
my son is a good example of this .
lovingly brought up according to christian beliefs , he is a very good student , attentive , well-raised and he doesn ’ t drink , smoke or do drugs . "

and academic achievements no longer count in a place where everything has gone haywire .
it ’ s a vicious cycle , and alcohol is the final nail that they can cling to .
the negative side of globalization – which we ’ ve all been made to believe will bring us prosperity – a future – is a revolution that is putting society in the poorhouse .
teenage binge drinking is the best example of that , of our unraveling society .
not until people are able to find work and bread will many a family be able to live in peace without boozing ...
these young people need role models – among them , their parents and everything that comes along with a peaceful coexistence . "
germany ’ s hannelore krause supports a multi-pronged approach : " i think that it ’ s not just poverty and frustration that drive young people to drinking .
more often it ’ s considered cool for young people today to test their strength by guzzling alcohol like water in a drive to prove that they ’ re finally grown up .
as long as it ’ s easy for youth to get their hands on alcohol – whether it ’ s from a parent ’ s house , the gas station , the grocery or wherever – alcohol abuse will be impossible to stop .
tough punishments are necessary from those who procure alcohol for minors and young people – regardless of the form it takes and how strong it is .
and : parents need to take responsibility for their children .
taking steps to explain the consequences of alcohol consumption should start at home with the parents and continue in the classroom , where teachers must also address the fact that alcohol creates not just highs and lows but also destroys one ’ s illusions – as happens with binge drinking – and can lead to death .
the internet , too , must guard against posts glorifying alcohol abuse . "
rolf bockmühl of the philippines blames the media – and government : " i think not !
our society and its families are falling apart .
solidarity , insofar as us older folks know it , hardly exists anymore ...
alcohol is too cheap , consumption is on the rise .
boozing is almost normal .
magazines , newspapers and television show people drinking and smoking far too often -lrb- and dw-tv deserves some of the blame -rrb- .
any kind of warning comes too late because young people don ’ t promote any kind of abstinence from alcohol and cigarettes in their cliques .
in such groups -lrb- as my grandchildren like to tell their grandfather -rrb- , the popular ones are those who are " strong . "
being strong means " heavy drinking and heavy bragging , " especially in public , if possible .
unlimited drinking is just one part of my concern .
unfortunately , many families are also at fault because they don ’ t provide children with role models .
as adolescents , we drank alcohol , too .
due to financial reasons , though , just a little .
we also didn ’ t have the time for it .
six-day weeks were normal , as was overtime .
then there was the sports club .
that was it .
we don ’ t want to have to go through tough times like that again .

gerhard seeger , also of the philippines , supports a smarter kind of information campaign : " bans on alcohol are useless – otherwise the problem wouldn ’ t exist .
alcohol abuse can only be stopped by young people themselves , insofar as they understand what it does to them and that this kind of binge drinking is disgusting .

2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " more information : boozing to oblivion - alcohol abuse amongst young people on the internet the latest report by the federal commissioner on drugs in germany raised widespread concern here .
more than 23,000 young people had to be treated for alcohol poisoning in german hospitals last year .

our question is : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " herbert fuchs , finland , says both nature and nurture matter : " this question is tough to answer .
many children and young people grow up in an environment marked by indescribable poverty – in the high-rises and backyards of the big city , where nothing works anymore and even the landlord is out of work .

"
" it can be an exemplary way for our society to acknowledge and overcome all the differences that confront us , " said schaeuble .
muslim leaders and government officials said after the conference that they hope to resume consultations after bundestag parliamentary elections in september . earlier this week , data compiled for the conference revealed for the first time that five percent of germany 's population is muslim , more than was previously thought , and highlighted muslim discontent about public schools .
schaeuble said the meetings since 2006 about improving the integration of muslims in germany had an international dimension and that german chancellor angela merkel would be briefing us president barack obama when she meets him at the white house .
before leaving for washington merkel met with muslim community leaders at the chancellery before the conference began .
" we need your voices to understand the entire range of islam in germany " , said merkel .
one of the key issues to emerge from the conference is an understanding that one of the challenges facing germany is to increase the cooperation between the german islamic conference , states and local authorities .
there is also the matter of enforcing equal rights for men and women .
“ going forward , it is imperative that we implement the recommendations that have come out of the german islamic conference to further the social and religious integration of muslims in germany , ” schaueble said .
many topics discussed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble sees positives of islam conference one of the key achievements of the conference was an acknowledgement by the participants of the importance the german legal system and adhering to the basic law .
other positive outcomes were plans for the establishment of islamic religious instruction and the adoptions of recommendations for such practical issues as the operation of mosques and dealing with islamic funerals in germany .
schaeuble acknowledged that the conference had not settled every issue but underscored the changed relationship between the state and muslims .
the german minister said a process of integration had been launched .
education was a major topic on the agenda .
one key development was a decision on women or girls wearing headscarfs at schools .
" freedom of religion means ... that wearing the veil is not forbidden " , concluded the german islamic conference -lrb- dik -rrb- .
" however , covering the whole face is incompatible with the open communication that education ... requires . "
both sides recommended that german schools make concessions on the the controversial issue of mixed sex swimming classes .
they also discussed issues like participation in physical education classes , school trips , and fasting during ramadan .
education ministers will debate the conference 's findings in the fall .
other recommendations that came from the conference had to do with training imams in germany , and creating islamic theological faculties here .
the conference also recommended establishing islamic theology courses at universities and lessons on islam in schools .
sex education will remain compulsory. nrt / av / dpa / afp / editor : jennifer abramsohn / mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italian foreign minister franco frattini said iran was " at a turning point " following the post-election street clashes , in which at least 17 people have been killed .
' ' it must choose whether or not to keep the door open to dialogue with the international community , " he said .
" the hand extended by the united states , which we have supported , can not come back with blood on it , " frattini said .
' ' we will adopt a particularly tough and clear position . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too said he expected foreign ministers from the industrialized nations of the group of eight to take a common line on the violence in iran .
russia against isolating iran but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that isolating iran would be the " wrong approach " for the g8 .
after a meeting with frattini , lavrov said " no-one " wanted to condemn tehran . rome had originally invited iran to attend the three-day gathering , arguing that tehran could have an important role to play in stabilizing afghanistan - a key focus of the meeting .
but rome retracted the invitation after tehran failed to respond and after days of violent clashes with demonstrators protesting iran 's disputed june 12 elections .

in another development on thursday , iranian state media said that eight members of the pro-government basij militia had been killed and dozens more wounded in the protests .
the eight deaths were in addition to 17 other people whose deaths have already been reported .
the figures can not be verified due to severe reporting restrictions inside iran .
meeting to focus on afghanistan-pakistan border unrest another topic at the talks in trieste on friday would be developments in afghanistan and pakistan , whose foreign ministers will both be present .
germany launched the " afpak " regional cooperation programme during its g8 presidency two years ago .
berlin now expects this dialogue to enable significant cooperation between the two countries in combating terrorism .
germany has also committed 90 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- in aid to the border region between afghanistan and pakistan .
taliban militants have stepped up their attacks as fears grow that islamist extremists are exacting revenge for a six-week military offensive against them in three northwest districts .
taliban-linked attacks have killed around 2,000 people in pakistan since july 2007 .
the eu said that it would call for international support for pakistan 's efforts against taliban-led extremists but also an " integrated long-term strategy , which includes social economic development , civilian law-enforcement structures and the rule of law , in order to secure the gains of the present counter-insurgency operations on a permanent basis .

" in contrast to us military power , the eu has been concentrating on the civilian aspect ; a soft power surge , " said shada islam , head of the asia program at the european policy center in brussels .
" this is done through a ' hearts and minds ' approach , using development aid and the promotion of a more balanced counter insurgency policy . "
according to daniel korski , a senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , the eu 's involvement in other aspects of the counter-insurgency mission has proved to be as important as any military investment .

the religious groups fighting the government are already in these camps and if there is a sign that the west 's help is slow , they will strengthen their grip . "
" also , as is the case in asia , refugees are being taken in by family members which puts families under immense strain .

the eu said that it would call for international support for pakistan 's efforts against taliban-led extremists but also an " integrated long-term strategy , which includes social economic development , civilian law-enforcement structures and the rule of law , in order to secure the gains of the present counter-insurgency operations on a permanent basis . "
" in contrast to us military power , the eu has been concentrating on the civilian aspect ; a soft power surge , " said shada islam , head of the asia program at the european policy center in brussels .
" this is done through a ' hearts and minds ' approach , using development aid and the promotion of a more balanced counter insurgency policy . "
according to daniel korski , a senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , the eu 's involvement in other aspects of the counter-insurgency mission has proved to be as important as any military investment .
more help needed for swat valley residents the fighting in the swat valley and northern provinces has taken a huge toll on the people of the region with un figures suggesting as many as 2.5 million pakistanis have been displaced by the conflict .
g8 leaders are expected to provide additional financial assistance to help the refugees on top of the 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- the eu pledged in may .
bildunterschrift : the inhabitants of swat valley are now housed in refugee camps " the eu was fast in reacting to the crisis but much more urgently needs to be done and it has recognized that , " shada islam said .
" what the eu needs to do , apart from increasing its aid , is be very visible in the refugee camps and show its support .
the religious groups fighting the government are already in these camps and if there is a sign that the west 's help is slow , they will strengthen their grip . "
" also , as is the case in asia , refugees are being taken in by family members which puts families under immense strain .
the eu can provide financial assistance to these families .
public opinion is in favor of this offensive and it 's very important to get aid to the refugees quickly to keep this support going . "

italian foreign minister franco frattini said iran was " at a turning point " following the post-election street clashes , in which at least 17 people have been killed .
' ' it must choose whether or not to keep the door open to dialogue with the international community , " he said .
" the hand extended by the united states , which we have supported , can not come back with blood on it , " frattini said .
' ' we will adopt a particularly tough and clear position . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too said he expected foreign ministers from the industrialized nations of the group of eight to take a common line on the violence in iran .
russia against isolating iran but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that isolating iran would be the " wrong approach " for the g8 .
after a meeting with frattini , lavrov said " no-one " wanted to condemn tehran . rome had originally invited iran to attend the three-day gathering , arguing that tehran could have an important role to play in stabilizing afghanistan - a key focus of the meeting .
but rome retracted the invitation after tehran failed to respond and after days of violent clashes with demonstrators protesting iran 's disputed june 12 elections .
" i think it 's a missed opportunity for the iranian government , " european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said .
she condemned " the excessive use of force by the security forces against any peaceful demonstrators . "
unrest in tehran continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians protest against the disputed election results at a rally in paris millions of iranians accuse the government of fraud in the june 12 election which gave president mahmoud ahmadinejad an verwhelming landslide victory , prompting protest demonstrations in which at least 17 people were killed .
in another development on thursday , iranian state media said that eight members of the pro-government basij militia had been killed and dozens more wounded in the protests .
the eight deaths were in addition to 17 other people whose deaths have already been reported .
the figures can not be verified due to severe reporting restrictions inside iran .
meeting to focus on afghanistan-pakistan border unrest another topic at the talks in trieste on friday would be developments in afghanistan and pakistan , whose foreign ministers will both be present .
germany launched the " afpak " regional cooperation programme during its g8 presidency two years ago .
berlin now expects this dialogue to enable significant cooperation between the two countries in combating terrorism .
germany has also committed 90 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- in aid to the border region between afghanistan and pakistan .

analysts say the two may not agree on all issues but germany and the us are now on the same page . british prime minister gordon brown was the first major european leader to pay a visit to president barack obama in the white house .
that was back in march of this year , shortly after obama had been sworn in .
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was next in april , followed by french president nicholas sarkozy in june .
even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , embroiled in a major scandal back home in italy , was finally granted a meeting with obama in the white house in june .
only the leader of europe 's biggest economy , german chancellor angela merkel , has not yet visited the white house , sparking media speculations that relations between merkel and obama were cooler than with obama 's predecessor george w. bush . jürgen chrobog , a former german ambassador to the united states , thinks those rumors are without merit .
he points to the fact that merkel and obama have already met twice in germany .
" there was never much time to talk about things in detail , but at least they have met , they know each other and i think it 's now time to make a full official visit to the united states " , says chrobog and adds : " she could n't have waited longer . "
the timing is n't really of much significance , agrees wess mitchell , co-founder of the center for european policy analysis .
he also does n't believe that that the personal chemistry between the two leaders is markedly worse than the chemistry between merkel and bush was .
and , says chrobog , to develop personal relations takes time , especially between the german chancellor and the new american president .
" merkel is not a person who is easygoing and relaxed .
she is very northern german actually .
obama is a completely different type of person . "
delicate balance on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international response to the events in iran will be discussed between merkel and obama more importantly than the personal relationship between the leader , say the experts , are the issues facing the us and germany .
the most pressing topic to be discussed in the white house could be iran , where chancellor merkel took a tougher line against the iranian regime than obama , stating her support for the protestors and urging a full recount of the ballots .
still , gale mattox , a germany expert and currently the fulbright-dow distinguished research chair of the roosevelt study center in the netherlands , says that after some hesitation obama this week came out quite strongly on iran as well .
" it seems to me that we are pretty much on the same sheet of music now . "
former ambassador chrobog says the us administration must tread a fine line on iran .
" it would be tremendously difficult if he would put pressure on iran and give the mullah government there an argument to say everything that is happening in iran is just because of the united states .
he should never interfere now in the domestic issues of iran .
it would backfire , it would be terrible . "
economic malaise the economic crisis will of course be another dominant issue for merkel and obama at the white house .
on this topic , argues mitchell , there could be some friction between both leaders .
" merkel and the german government clearly do n't look favorably on what the us federal reserve describes as loose monetary policy . "
merkel could use the problems the german government has with the american response to the economic crisis to point the finger at the united states as the main culprit for the global crisis , says mitchell .
but it 's not just the germans who may want to ruffle some feathers .
" i think when they meet , obama will press merkel to make a more positive contribution to solving the global crisis .
there has been a lot of criticism in washington of the german government 's reluctance to step forward and play a stronger role . "
mitchell feels that the meeting in the white house wo n't be able to solve those differences , an argument gale mattox agrees with : " i think it will remain a point of contention , because we have taken very different approaches and i do n't see that we are either going to one side or to the other side . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama has reversed his predecessor 's environmental policy climate change will be another topic that will be discussed , but will likely remain unresolved .
analysts note that obama has reversed the bush policy on global warming and seems personally committed to adressing the issue .
but they point out that in the end any binding international agreement that obama signs will have to be ratified by congress .
in addition , it could be difficult for obama to press forward domestically on climate issues amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory .
still , says chrobog , even if obama can not go as far as the europeans want him to go on climate change , at least the us president and germany are now reading from the same page .

the timing is n't really of much significance , agrees wess mitchell , co-founder of the center for european policy analysis .
he also does n't believe that that the personal chemistry between the two leaders is markedly worse than the chemistry between merkel and bush was .
and , says chrobog , to develop personal relations takes time , especially between the german chancellor and the new american president .
" merkel is not a person who is easygoing and relaxed .
she is very northern german actually .
obama is a completely different type of person . "
delicate balance on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international response to the events in iran will be discussed between merkel and obama more importantly than the personal relationship between the leader , say the experts , are the issues facing the us and germany .
the most pressing topic to be discussed in the white house could be iran , where chancellor merkel took a tougher line against the iranian regime than obama , stating her support for the protestors and urging a full recount of the ballots .
still , gale mattox , a germany expert and currently the fulbright-dow distinguished research chair of the roosevelt study center in the netherlands , says that after some hesitation obama this week came out quite strongly on iran as well .
" it seems to me that we are pretty much on the same sheet of music now . "
former ambassador chrobog says the us administration must tread a fine line on iran .
" it would be tremendously difficult if he would put pressure on iran and give the mullah government there an argument to say everything that is happening in iran is just because of the united states .
he should never interfere now in the domestic issues of iran .
it would backfire , it would be terrible . "
economic malaise the economic crisis will of course be another dominant issue for merkel and obama at the white house .
on this topic , argues mitchell , there could be some friction between both leaders .
" merkel and the german government clearly do n't look favorably on what the us federal reserve describes as loose monetary policy . "
merkel could use the problems the german government has with the american response to the economic crisis to point the finger at the united states as the main culprit for the global crisis , says mitchell .
but it 's not just the germans who may want to ruffle some feathers .
" i think when they meet , obama will press merkel to make a more positive contribution to solving the global crisis .
there has been a lot of criticism in washington of the german government 's reluctance to step forward and play a stronger role . "
mitchell feels that the meeting in the white house wo n't be able to solve those differences , an argument gale mattox agrees with : " i think it will remain a point of contention , because we have taken very different approaches and i do n't see that we are either going to one side or to the other side . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama has reversed his predecessor 's environmental policy climate change will be another topic that will be discussed , but will likely remain unresolved .
analysts note that obama has reversed the bush policy on global warming and seems personally committed to adressing the issue .
but they point out that in the end any binding international agreement that obama signs will have to be ratified by congress .
in addition , it could be difficult for obama to press forward domestically on climate issues amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory .
still , says chrobog , even if obama can not go as far as the europeans want him to go on climate change , at least the us president and germany are now reading from the same page .

the most pressing topic to be discussed in the white house could be iran , where chancellor merkel took a tougher line against the iranian regime than obama , stating her support for the protestors and urging a full recount of the ballots .
still , gale mattox , a germany expert and currently the fulbright-dow distinguished research chair of the roosevelt study center in the netherlands , says that after some hesitation obama this week came out quite strongly on iran as well .
" it seems to me that we are pretty much on the same sheet of music now . "
former ambassador chrobog says the us administration must tread a fine line on iran .
" it would be tremendously difficult if he would put pressure on iran and give the mullah government there an argument to say everything that is happening in iran is just because of the united states .
he should never interfere now in the domestic issues of iran .
it would backfire , it would be terrible . "
economic malaise the economic crisis will of course be another dominant issue for merkel and obama at the white house .
on this topic , argues mitchell , there could be some friction between both leaders .
" merkel and the german government clearly do n't look favorably on what the us federal reserve describes as loose monetary policy . "
merkel could use the problems the german government has with the american response to the economic crisis to point the finger at the united states as the main culprit for the global crisis , says mitchell .
but it 's not just the germans who may want to ruffle some feathers .
" i think when they meet , obama will press merkel to make a more positive contribution to solving the global crisis .
there has been a lot of criticism in washington of the german government 's reluctance to step forward and play a stronger role . "
mitchell feels that the meeting in the white house wo n't be able to solve those differences , an argument gale mattox agrees with : " i think it will remain a point of contention , because we have taken very different approaches and i do n't see that we are either going to one side or to the other side . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama has reversed his predecessor 's environmental policy climate change will be another topic that will be discussed , but will likely remain unresolved .
analysts note that obama has reversed the bush policy on global warming and seems personally committed to adressing the issue .
but they point out that in the end any binding international agreement that obama signs will have to be ratified by congress .
in addition , it could be difficult for obama to press forward domestically on climate issues amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory .
still , says chrobog , even if obama can not go as far as the europeans want him to go on climate change , at least the us president and germany are now reading from the same page .

the brothers had been accused of driving the killer to the scene and the policeman of providing logistical assistance .
a fourth defendant , pavel ryaguzov , a secret police agent , was acquitted in a separate trial for allegedly providing the killer with politkovskaya 's address . despite lasting almost four months , the original trial failed to shed any significant light on the circumstances of the killing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the original four suspects was the killer the gunman , who actually shot politkovskaya in the lobby of her central moscow apartment building on october 7 , 2006 , has not been apprehended .
rights groups have long criticized russia 's failure to bring to justice the person , or persons , responsible for the death of politkovskaya .
the new supreme court ruling means the verdict of the moscow district military court has been annulled and the criminal case referred back to the same court for a new hearing .
lawyers for the politkovskaya family said they did not agree with the case being thrown out , or with the order for a retrial , because the men charged had not been the real perpetrators of the crime .
" i think there should not be a repeat trial .
the case should be sent by the court for additional investigation , " politkovskaya 's son ilya said .
politkovskaya , who had been an award-winning investigative journalist for the novaya gazeta newspaper , wrote dozens of articles on human rights abuses in russia and published a book called " putin 's russia . "
in that book , she accused the former president and current prime minister , vladimir putin , of using the chechen conflict to strangle democracy , while detailing horrific rights abuses in chechnya .
her murder triggered an outcry in the international community and raised serious concerns about a surge in crackdowns against people critical of the kremlin and putin. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the other good news is that is does n't seem to have any side-effects . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is currently testing a hormonal birth control pill for men .
michael zitzman , who is heading the study , told deutsche welle that it will likely be available to the public in 2012 at the earliest . deutsche welle : mr. zitzman , would you take the pill for men yourself ? prof. michael zitzman : yes , of course . why is everyone making such a big deal about this pill for men when it is n't even a pill ? it 's kind of like a product name , because the pill for women is so well known .
there 's never been an oral pill for men that can bring the same result as it does for women .
men have had to use shots , implants , and gels that are applied on the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael zitzmann heads the who study so how does the pill for men actually work ? with this hormonal form of contraception for men , natural testosterone is applied together with gestagen , which is a precursor of testosterone .
the goal is to completely suppress the hormones that stimulate the production of sperm in the testicles . how much testosterone and gestagen is needed ? the patient takes the dose that used for men who 've had a testicular disease , for example , and need to take replacement hormones .
they have to take extra testosterone to avoid side-effects like depression , osteoporoses or anaemia . is there a recommended dose ? 1,000 milligrams .
that 's about 1 gram of testosterone every two months . you 've said that sperm production is reduced by up to 100 percent .
but that 's not irreversible , is it ? no , of course not .
if that were the case then you might as well just have a vasectomy .
this method is completely reversible - that 's been the case with all the men tested .
it takes about four months , or sometimes only two , for the sperm to build up again . it takes the same amount of time for the sperm to disappear , since they go through a maturing process in the testicles .
once this process has begun , then their independent of the hormones .
that means that the sperm continue to develop without any hormones .
in the study , we noticed that after 4 weeks the sperm had disappeared in some of the men .
it usually takes two to four months , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pill will not affect appearance , say researchers does the additional testosterone change the man 's body in any way ?
testosterone is usually associated with muscles , body builders , and doping . it depends on dose of the hormone .
when a healthy man is given the same dose of testosterone that he would normally produce , then his body automatically reduces its own production of the hormone and the sperm count drops .
that means that his hormone levels do n't change and neither do his appearance or health . how far along is this study ?
the idea of a birth control pill for men has been around for a while now , and there have been lots of research projects … it has been around for a while .
the first thing we had to do was to figure out how everything works .
how well does it work and what are the side effects ?
the side effects that had been reported came from studies where placebos were used , which means some of the men received fake medication . the side-effects all resulted from placebo-niveau .
some of the men felt poorly or had trouble sleeping , but that probably had nothing to do with the actual medication .
it might have just been a side-effect of knowing they were taking part in a study , or it could also have just been a coincidence . so there are no side effects ? the only side-effect is that the testicles shrink a bit , because they stop working .
however , they return to their normal size when the men stop taking the pill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers do n't know if the pill for men appeals to couples when can we expect to see the birth control pill for men on the market ? that depends on how the pharmaceutical industry sees it and whether the world health organization receives a license .
i think that the study by the world health organization will be successful since we already know from past studies that it works . what we still need to find out is what couples think of this method .
do they feel good about it ?
i ca n't answer that just yet , because we still need to find the answer to that .
we think that , if everything goes well , the pill could be on the market as early as 2012 or 2013 . is the pharmaceutical industry interested ? yes , because the substances that are needed for the pill are already on the market .
they 've been permitted for other uses and the authorities would just have to approve them for the pill for men .
then the industry could put it on the market relatively quickly . interview : judith hartl -lrb- km -rrb- edited by : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " more information : boozing to oblivion - alcohol abuse amongst young people on the internet the latest report by the federal commissioner on drugs in germany raised widespread concern here .
more than 23,000 young people had to be treated for alcohol poisoning in german hospitals last year .
binge drinking is becoming increasingly popular .
and not only that , many young people are now also filming their excessive drinking and posting it on the internet .
experts are warning of the copycat effect , and many involved in youth welfare are calling for such websites to be blocked .
the federal center for health education has launched a huge campaign this week aimed at discouraging alcohol abuse .
our question is : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " herbert fuchs , finland , says both nature and nurture matter : " this question is tough to answer .
many children and young people grow up in an environment marked by indescribable poverty – in the high-rises and backyards of the big city , where nothing works anymore and even the landlord is out of work .
where the unemployed parents and neighbors pass the time , the endlessly long days with no positive prospects for the future – that ’ s where life is more than difficult to bear .
yes , and in public and school life , these young people bear their dammed-up fury in a new way – resorting to senseless boozing and violence against others – the way they see and experience it in their nearby surroundings on a daily basis .
for these youth , the experience of success is what ’ s missing most , of being able to do something , for example , to play an instrument or have a hobby .
and academic achievements no longer count in a place where everything has gone haywire .
it ’ s a vicious cycle , and alcohol is the final nail that they can cling to .
the negative side of globalization – which we ’ ve all been made to believe will bring us prosperity – a future – is a revolution that is putting society in the poorhouse .
teenage binge drinking is the best example of that , of our unraveling society .
not until people are able to find work and bread will many a family be able to live in peace without boozing ...
these young people need role models – among them , their parents and everything that comes along with a peaceful coexistence . "
germany ’ s hannelore krause supports a multi-pronged approach : " i think that it ’ s not just poverty and frustration that drive young people to drinking .
more often it ’ s considered cool for young people today to test their strength by guzzling alcohol like water in a drive to prove that they ’ re finally grown up .
as long as it ’ s easy for youth to get their hands on alcohol – whether it ’ s from a parent ’ s house , the gas station , the grocery or wherever – alcohol abuse will be impossible to stop .
tough punishments are necessary from those who procure alcohol for minors and young people – regardless of the form it takes and how strong it is .
and : parents need to take responsibility for their children .
taking steps to explain the consequences of alcohol consumption should start at home with the parents and continue in the classroom , where teachers must also address the fact that alcohol creates not just highs and lows but also destroys one ’ s illusions – as happens with binge drinking – and can lead to death .
the internet , too , must guard against posts glorifying alcohol abuse . "
rolf bockmühl of the philippines blames the media – and government : " i think not !
our society and its families are falling apart .
solidarity , insofar as us older folks know it , hardly exists anymore ...
alcohol is too cheap , consumption is on the rise .
boozing is almost normal .
magazines , newspapers and television show people drinking and smoking far too often -lrb- and dw-tv deserves some of the blame -rrb- .
any kind of warning comes too late because young people don ’ t promote any kind of abstinence from alcohol and cigarettes in their cliques .
in such groups -lrb- as my grandchildren like to tell their grandfather -rrb- , the popular ones are those who are " strong . "
being strong means " heavy drinking and heavy bragging , " especially in public , if possible .
unlimited drinking is just one part of my concern .
unfortunately , many families are also at fault because they don ’ t provide children with role models .
as adolescents , we drank alcohol , too .
due to financial reasons , though , just a little .
we also didn ’ t have the time for it .
six-day weeks were normal , as was overtime .
then there was the sports club .
that was it .
we don ’ t want to have to go through tough times like that again .
i don ’ t begrudge today ’ s youth of their freedom and free time .
it ’ s just – where , when and how have families and society adjusted to rapid consumption and the fast-paced internet era ?
what do schools have to say ?
both of my school-aged children came to learn to value free time , both during and in addition to their studies .
the pressure to perform set in during exam week , but that ’ s it .
evening excursions ended all too often – in my opinion – and for the ladies , too , in various stages of drunkenness .
such were the " freedoms " of the students , whose parents were happy to pay for everything .
did we spoil our children with the " good " in life ?
that ’ s what i ask myself today .
stricter laws hardly help .
penalties don ’ t help , either .
i think that families and families alone are the ones able to instill values in their children .
can families from the so-called " impoverished " classes achieve that , too ?
there ’ s a big problem here .

2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " more information : boozing to oblivion - alcohol abuse amongst young people on the internet the latest report by the federal commissioner on drugs in germany raised widespread concern here .
more than 23,000 young people had to be treated for alcohol poisoning in german hospitals last year .
binge drinking is becoming increasingly popular .
and not only that , many young people are now also filming their excessive drinking and posting it on the internet .
experts are warning of the copycat effect , and many involved in youth welfare are calling for such websites to be blocked .
the federal center for health education has launched a huge campaign this week aimed at discouraging alcohol abuse .
our question is : " can teenage binge drinking be stopped ? " herbert fuchs , finland , says both nature and nurture matter : " this question is tough to answer .
many children and young people grow up in an environment marked by indescribable poverty – in the high-rises and backyards of the big city , where nothing works anymore and even the landlord is out of work .
where the unemployed parents and neighbors pass the time , the endlessly long days with no positive prospects for the future – that ’ s where life is more than difficult to bear .
yes , and in public and school life , these young people bear their dammed-up fury in a new way – resorting to senseless boozing and violence against others – the way they see and experience it in their nearby surroundings on a daily basis .
for these youth , the experience of success is what ’ s missing most , of being able to do something , for example , to play an instrument or have a hobby .
and academic achievements no longer count in a place where everything has gone haywire .
it ’ s a vicious cycle , and alcohol is the final nail that they can cling to .
the negative side of globalization – which we ’ ve all been made to believe will bring us prosperity – a future – is a revolution that is putting society in the poorhouse .
teenage binge drinking is the best example of that , of our unraveling society .
not until people are able to find work and bread will many a family be able to live in peace without boozing ...
these young people need role models – among them , their parents and everything that comes along with a peaceful coexistence . "
germany ’ s hannelore krause supports a multi-pronged approach : " i think that it ’ s not just poverty and frustration that drive young people to drinking .
more often it ’ s considered cool for young people today to test their strength by guzzling alcohol like water in a drive to prove that they ’ re finally grown up .
as long as it ’ s easy for youth to get their hands on alcohol – whether it ’ s from a parent ’ s house , the gas station , the grocery or wherever – alcohol abuse will be impossible to stop .
tough punishments are necessary from those who procure alcohol for minors and young people – regardless of the form it takes and how strong it is .
and : parents need to take responsibility for their children .
taking steps to explain the consequences of alcohol consumption should start at home with the parents and continue in the classroom , where teachers must also address the fact that alcohol creates not just highs and lows but also destroys one ’ s illusions – as happens with binge drinking – and can lead to death .
the internet , too , must guard against posts glorifying alcohol abuse . "
rolf bockmühl of the philippines blames the media – and government : " i think not !
our society and its families are falling apart .
solidarity , insofar as us older folks know it , hardly exists anymore ...
alcohol is too cheap , consumption is on the rise .
boozing is almost normal .
magazines , newspapers and television show people drinking and smoking far too often -lrb- and dw-tv deserves some of the blame -rrb- .
any kind of warning comes too late because young people don ’ t promote any kind of abstinence from alcohol and cigarettes in their cliques .
in such groups -lrb- as my grandchildren like to tell their grandfather -rrb- , the popular ones are those who are " strong . "
being strong means " heavy drinking and heavy bragging , " especially in public , if possible .
unlimited drinking is just one part of my concern .
unfortunately , many families are also at fault because they don ’ t provide children with role models .
as adolescents , we drank alcohol , too .
due to financial reasons , though , just a little .
we also didn ’ t have the time for it .
six-day weeks were normal , as was overtime .
then there was the sports club .
that was it .
we don ’ t want to have to go through tough times like that again .
i don ’ t begrudge today ’ s youth of their freedom and free time .
it ’ s just – where , when and how have families and society adjusted to rapid consumption and the fast-paced internet era ?
what do schools have to say ?
both of my school-aged children came to learn to value free time , both during and in addition to their studies .
the pressure to perform set in during exam week , but that ’ s it .
evening excursions ended all too often – in my opinion – and for the ladies , too , in various stages of drunkenness .
such were the " freedoms " of the students , whose parents were happy to pay for everything .
did we spoil our children with the " good " in life ?
that ’ s what i ask myself today .
stricter laws hardly help .
penalties don ’ t help , either .
i think that families and families alone are the ones able to instill values in their children .
can families from the so-called " impoverished " classes achieve that , too ?
there ’ s a big problem here .
why is the government letting so many people fall by the wayside ?
that ’ s something the government is at risk of doing ...
the bottom line : i don ’ t see any clear way of tackling this problem .
it ’ s humiliating for me – i feel helpless .
where is our society headed ? "
gerhard seeger , also of the philippines , supports a smarter kind of information campaign : " bans on alcohol are useless – otherwise the problem wouldn ’ t exist .

"
" it can be an exemplary way for our society to acknowledge and overcome all the differences that confront us , " said schaeuble .
muslim leaders and government officials said after the conference that they hope to resume consultations after bundestag parliamentary elections in september . earlier this week , data compiled for the conference revealed for the first time that five percent of germany 's population is muslim , more than was previously thought , and highlighted muslim discontent about public schools .
schaeuble said the meetings since 2006 about improving the integration of muslims in germany had an international dimension and that german chancellor angela merkel would be briefing us president barack obama when she meets him at the white house .
before leaving for washington merkel met with muslim community leaders at the chancellery before the conference began .

one of the key issues to emerge from the conference is an understanding that one of the challenges facing germany is to increase the cooperation between the german islamic conference , states and local authorities .

italian foreign minister franco frattini said iran was " at a turning point " following the post-election street clashes , in which at least 17 people have been killed .
' ' it must choose whether or not to keep the door open to dialogue with the international community , " he said .
" the hand extended by the united states , which we have supported , can not come back with blood on it , " frattini said .
' ' we will adopt a particularly tough and clear position . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier too said he expected foreign ministers from the industrialized nations of the group of eight to take a common line on the violence in iran .
russia against isolating iran but russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said that isolating iran would be the " wrong approach " for the g8 .
after a meeting with frattini , lavrov said " no-one " wanted to condemn tehran . rome had originally invited iran to attend the three-day gathering , arguing that tehran could have an important role to play in stabilizing afghanistan - a key focus of the meeting .
but rome retracted the invitation after tehran failed to respond and after days of violent clashes with demonstrators protesting iran 's disputed june 12 elections .
" i think it 's a missed opportunity for the iranian government , " european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said .
she condemned " the excessive use of force by the security forces against any peaceful demonstrators . "
unrest in tehran continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians protest against the disputed election results at a rally in paris millions of iranians accuse the government of fraud in the june 12 election which gave president mahmoud ahmadinejad an verwhelming landslide victory , prompting protest demonstrations in which at least 17 people were killed .
in another development on thursday , iranian state media said that eight members of the pro-government basij militia had been killed and dozens more wounded in the protests .
the eight deaths were in addition to 17 other people whose deaths have already been reported .
the figures can not be verified due to severe reporting restrictions inside iran .
meeting to focus on afghanistan-pakistan border unrest another topic at the talks in trieste on friday would be developments in afghanistan and pakistan , whose foreign ministers will both be present .
germany launched the " afpak " regional cooperation programme during its g8 presidency two years ago .
berlin now expects this dialogue to enable significant cooperation between the two countries in combating terrorism .
germany has also committed 90 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- in aid to the border region between afghanistan and pakistan .
taliban militants have stepped up their attacks as fears grow that islamist extremists are exacting revenge for a six-week military offensive against them in three northwest districts .
taliban-linked attacks have killed around 2,000 people in pakistan since july 2007 .
the eu said that it would call for international support for pakistan 's efforts against taliban-led extremists but also an " integrated long-term strategy , which includes social economic development , civilian law-enforcement structures and the rule of law , in order to secure the gains of the present counter-insurgency operations on a permanent basis . "
" in contrast to us military power , the eu has been concentrating on the civilian aspect ; a soft power surge , " said shada islam , head of the asia program at the european policy center in brussels .
" this is done through a ' hearts and minds ' approach , using development aid and the promotion of a more balanced counter insurgency policy . "
according to daniel korski , a senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , the eu 's involvement in other aspects of the counter-insurgency mission has proved to be as important as any military investment .
more help needed for swat valley residents the fighting in the swat valley and northern provinces has taken a huge toll on the people of the region with un figures suggesting as many as 2.5 million pakistanis have been displaced by the conflict .
g8 leaders are expected to provide additional financial assistance to help the refugees on top of the 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- the eu pledged in may .
bildunterschrift : the inhabitants of swat valley are now housed in refugee camps " the eu was fast in reacting to the crisis but much more urgently needs to be done and it has recognized that , " shada islam said .
" what the eu needs to do , apart from increasing its aid , is be very visible in the refugee camps and show its support .
the religious groups fighting the government are already in these camps and if there is a sign that the west 's help is slow , they will strengthen their grip . "
" also , as is the case in asia , refugees are being taken in by family members which puts families under immense strain .
the eu can provide financial assistance to these families .
public opinion is in favor of this offensive and it 's very important to get aid to the refugees quickly to keep this support going . "

after a meeting with frattini , lavrov said " no-one " wanted to condemn tehran . rome had originally invited iran to attend the three-day gathering , arguing that tehran could have an important role to play in stabilizing afghanistan - a key focus of the meeting .
but rome retracted the invitation after tehran failed to respond and after days of violent clashes with demonstrators protesting iran 's disputed june 12 elections .
" i think it 's a missed opportunity for the iranian government , " european union external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said .
she condemned " the excessive use of force by the security forces against any peaceful demonstrators . "
unrest in tehran continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians protest against the disputed election results at a rally in paris millions of iranians accuse the government of fraud in the june 12 election which gave president mahmoud ahmadinejad an verwhelming landslide victory , prompting protest demonstrations in which at least 17 people were killed .
in another development on thursday , iranian state media said that eight members of the pro-government basij militia had been killed and dozens more wounded in the protests .
the eight deaths were in addition to 17 other people whose deaths have already been reported .
the figures can not be verified due to severe reporting restrictions inside iran .
meeting to focus on afghanistan-pakistan border unrest another topic at the talks in trieste on friday would be developments in afghanistan and pakistan , whose foreign ministers will both be present .
germany launched the " afpak " regional cooperation programme during its g8 presidency two years ago .
berlin now expects this dialogue to enable significant cooperation between the two countries in combating terrorism .
germany has also committed 90 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- in aid to the border region between afghanistan and pakistan .
taliban militants have stepped up their attacks as fears grow that islamist extremists are exacting revenge for a six-week military offensive against them in three northwest districts .
taliban-linked attacks have killed around 2,000 people in pakistan since july 2007 .
the eu said that it would call for international support for pakistan 's efforts against taliban-led extremists but also an " integrated long-term strategy , which includes social economic development , civilian law-enforcement structures and the rule of law , in order to secure the gains of the present counter-insurgency operations on a permanent basis . "
" in contrast to us military power , the eu has been concentrating on the civilian aspect ; a soft power surge , " said shada islam , head of the asia program at the european policy center in brussels .
" this is done through a ' hearts and minds ' approach , using development aid and the promotion of a more balanced counter insurgency policy . "
according to daniel korski , a senior policy fellow at the european council on foreign relations , the eu 's involvement in other aspects of the counter-insurgency mission has proved to be as important as any military investment .
more help needed for swat valley residents the fighting in the swat valley and northern provinces has taken a huge toll on the people of the region with un figures suggesting as many as 2.5 million pakistanis have been displaced by the conflict .
g8 leaders are expected to provide additional financial assistance to help the refugees on top of the 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- the eu pledged in may .
bildunterschrift : the inhabitants of swat valley are now housed in refugee camps " the eu was fast in reacting to the crisis but much more urgently needs to be done and it has recognized that , " shada islam said .
" what the eu needs to do , apart from increasing its aid , is be very visible in the refugee camps and show its support .
the religious groups fighting the government are already in these camps and if there is a sign that the west 's help is slow , they will strengthen their grip . "
" also , as is the case in asia , refugees are being taken in by family members which puts families under immense strain .
the eu can provide financial assistance to these families .
public opinion is in favor of this offensive and it 's very important to get aid to the refugees quickly to keep this support going . "

the us squad will now face brazil , the winner of thursday 's semifinal against south africa . the united states scored its greatest win in almost 60 years by beating european champions spain to reach the final of the confederations cup .
a first-half strike from villareal 's jozy altidore and another goal 16 minutes from time by fulham 's clint dempsey did the damage in what will go down as one of the biggest victories in us soccer history .
" this win is huge for american soccer , " said man of the match dempsey .
" this is our first time to be in the final of a major competition , so obviously we 're thrilled . "
spain is currently ranked as the world 's best team by fifa , the governing body of world soccer .
but for spain the defeat was even more painful as it ended a record of 15 consecutive wins and also prevented them from surpassing brazil 's record of 35-match unbeaten runs .
spain had not been defeated since going down 1-0 in a friendly to romania in november 2006 .
us faces brazil in sunday 's final bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few had expected the us could throw out the favorites " a lot of people did n't think we could do this , " us defender oguchi onyewu said after the game .
" but we showed our heart , our grit and our resilience .
it 's a huge achievement for us .
i bet there were n't a lot of people in europe and around the world that would have bet on this . "
even spanish striker fernando torres was forced to admit that his side was up against a more-than-worthy opponent .
" they have fantastic players and a strong team , and maybe by beating spain and breaking our streak people will start to recognize that . "
the result was even more remarkable because the us had lost their opening two group matches in the competition and were heading out until they beat egypt 3-0 on sunday .
after brazil had sunk italy by the same score , the us only squeezed through on the numbers of goals scored .
however , the match ended in bittersweet agony for the us when michael bradley , after a brilliant game in midfield , was sent off three minutes from time .
he will now miss sunday 's final against brazil , which beat south africa in the other semi-final thursday night. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they have fantastic players and a strong team , and maybe by beating spain and breaking our streak people will start to recognize that . "
the result was even more remarkable because the us had lost their opening two group matches in the competition and were heading out until they beat egypt 3-0 on sunday .
after brazil had sunk italy by the same score , the us only squeezed through on the numbers of goals scored .
however , the match ended in bittersweet agony for the us when michael bradley , after a brilliant game in midfield , was sent off three minutes from time .
he will now miss sunday 's final against brazil , which beat south africa in the other semi-final thursday night. ai / reuters / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts say the two may not agree on all issues but germany and the us are now on the same page . british prime minister gordon brown was the first major european leader to pay a visit to president barack obama in the white house .
that was back in march of this year , shortly after obama had been sworn in .
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was next in april , followed by french president nicholas sarkozy in june .
even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , embroiled in a major scandal back home in italy , was finally granted a meeting with obama in the white house in june .
only the leader of europe 's biggest economy , german chancellor angela merkel , has not yet visited the white house , sparking media speculations that relations between merkel and obama were cooler than with obama 's predecessor george w. bush . jürgen chrobog , a former german ambassador to the united states , thinks those rumors are without merit .
he points to the fact that merkel and obama have already met twice in germany .
" there was never much time to talk about things in detail , but at least they have met , they know each other and i think it 's now time to make a full official visit to the united states " , says chrobog and adds : " she could n't have waited longer . "
the timing is n't really of much significance , agrees wess mitchell , co-founder of the center for european policy analysis .
he also does n't believe that that the personal chemistry between the two leaders is markedly worse than the chemistry between merkel and bush was .
and , says chrobog , to develop personal relations takes time , especially between the german chancellor and the new american president .
" merkel is not a person who is easygoing and relaxed .
she is very northern german actually .
obama is a completely different type of person . "
delicate balance on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international response to the events in iran will be discussed between merkel and obama more importantly than the personal relationship between the leader , say the experts , are the issues facing the us and germany .
the most pressing topic to be discussed in the white house could be iran , where chancellor merkel took a tougher line against the iranian regime than obama , stating her support for the protestors and urging a full recount of the ballots .
still , gale mattox , a germany expert and currently the fulbright-dow distinguished research chair of the roosevelt study center in the netherlands , says that after some hesitation obama this week came out quite strongly on iran as well .
" it seems to me that we are pretty much on the same sheet of music now . "
former ambassador chrobog says the us administration must tread a fine line on iran .
" it would be tremendously difficult if he would put pressure on iran and give the mullah government there an argument to say everything that is happening in iran is just because of the united states .
he should never interfere now in the domestic issues of iran .
it would backfire , it would be terrible . "
economic malaise the economic crisis will of course be another dominant issue for merkel and obama at the white house .
on this topic , argues mitchell , there could be some friction between both leaders .
" merkel and the german government clearly do n't look favorably on what the us federal reserve describes as loose monetary policy . "
merkel could use the problems the german government has with the american response to the economic crisis to point the finger at the united states as the main culprit for the global crisis , says mitchell .
but it 's not just the germans who may want to ruffle some feathers .
" i think when they meet , obama will press merkel to make a more positive contribution to solving the global crisis .
there has been a lot of criticism in washington of the german government 's reluctance to step forward and play a stronger role . "
mitchell feels that the meeting in the white house wo n't be able to solve those differences , an argument gale mattox agrees with : " i think it will remain a point of contention , because we have taken very different approaches and i do n't see that we are either going to one side or to the other side . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama has reversed his predecessor 's environmental policy climate change will be another topic that will be discussed , but will likely remain unresolved .
analysts note that obama has reversed the bush policy on global warming and seems personally committed to adressing the issue .
but they point out that in the end any binding international agreement that obama signs will have to be ratified by congress .
in addition , it could be difficult for obama to press forward domestically on climate issues amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory .
still , says chrobog , even if obama can not go as far as the europeans want him to go on climate change , at least the us president and germany are now reading from the same page .

analysts say the two may not agree on all issues but germany and the us are now on the same page . british prime minister gordon brown was the first major european leader to pay a visit to president barack obama in the white house .
that was back in march of this year , shortly after obama had been sworn in .
spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero was next in april , followed by french president nicholas sarkozy in june .
even italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , embroiled in a major scandal back home in italy , was finally granted a meeting with obama in the white house in june .
only the leader of europe 's biggest economy , german chancellor angela merkel , has not yet visited the white house , sparking media speculations that relations between merkel and obama were cooler than with obama 's predecessor george w. bush . jürgen chrobog , a former german ambassador to the united states , thinks those rumors are without merit .
he points to the fact that merkel and obama have already met twice in germany .
" there was never much time to talk about things in detail , but at least they have met , they know each other and i think it 's now time to make a full official visit to the united states " , says chrobog and adds : " she could n't have waited longer . "
the timing is n't really of much significance , agrees wess mitchell , co-founder of the center for european policy analysis .
he also does n't believe that that the personal chemistry between the two leaders is markedly worse than the chemistry between merkel and bush was .
and , says chrobog , to develop personal relations takes time , especially between the german chancellor and the new american president .
" merkel is not a person who is easygoing and relaxed .
she is very northern german actually .
obama is a completely different type of person . "
delicate balance on iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international response to the events in iran will be discussed between merkel and obama more importantly than the personal relationship between the leader , say the experts , are the issues facing the us and germany .
the most pressing topic to be discussed in the white house could be iran , where chancellor merkel took a tougher line against the iranian regime than obama , stating her support for the protestors and urging a full recount of the ballots .
still , gale mattox , a germany expert and currently the fulbright-dow distinguished research chair of the roosevelt study center in the netherlands , says that after some hesitation obama this week came out quite strongly on iran as well .
" it seems to me that we are pretty much on the same sheet of music now . "
former ambassador chrobog says the us administration must tread a fine line on iran .
" it would be tremendously difficult if he would put pressure on iran and give the mullah government there an argument to say everything that is happening in iran is just because of the united states .
he should never interfere now in the domestic issues of iran .
it would backfire , it would be terrible . "
economic malaise the economic crisis will of course be another dominant issue for merkel and obama at the white house .
on this topic , argues mitchell , there could be some friction between both leaders .
" merkel and the german government clearly do n't look favorably on what the us federal reserve describes as loose monetary policy . "
merkel could use the problems the german government has with the american response to the economic crisis to point the finger at the united states as the main culprit for the global crisis , says mitchell .
but it 's not just the germans who may want to ruffle some feathers .
" i think when they meet , obama will press merkel to make a more positive contribution to solving the global crisis .
there has been a lot of criticism in washington of the german government 's reluctance to step forward and play a stronger role . "
mitchell feels that the meeting in the white house wo n't be able to solve those differences , an argument gale mattox agrees with : " i think it will remain a point of contention , because we have taken very different approaches and i do n't see that we are either going to one side or to the other side . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama has reversed his predecessor 's environmental policy climate change will be another topic that will be discussed , but will likely remain unresolved .
analysts note that obama has reversed the bush policy on global warming and seems personally committed to adressing the issue .
but they point out that in the end any binding international agreement that obama signs will have to be ratified by congress .
in addition , it could be difficult for obama to press forward domestically on climate issues amid the worst economic crisis in recent memory .
still , says chrobog , even if obama can not go as far as the europeans want him to go on climate change , at least the us president and germany are now reading from the same page .

she ’ s been on the move since childhood and loves exploring new countries . born in tübingen , meier grew up in worms , brussels and mainz .
after her school-leaving exams , she finished an interpreting program in florence before taking on romance studies – italian and spanish – and art history .
during her academic career , she commuted between germany , italy and the united states and spent a number of months in mexico .
following the successful completion of her master ’ s exams , meier finished a master ’ s degree in journalism and a doctorate of philosophy in italian linguistics at the university mainz . since 2001 , meier has worked for german broadcaster zdf .
whether at the oscars in los angeles or the film festival in venice , she has reported from among the most beautiful locations in the world .
at the start of 2008 , meier was a presenter for the english edition of dw-tv ’ s culture and lifestyle magazine " euromaxx . "
since the end of june 2009 , she has been the presenter for both the german and english versions of travel magazine " discover germany " on dw-tv .

he has written more than 130 works and over 40 of these in the past decade alone . dw 's breandain o 'shea met with carter during the aldeburgh music festival in the uk , where a special program of his music was being presented to celebrate his 100th birthday . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview . deutsche welle : mr. carter , you spent a period of your life in germany - around 1964 , when you wrote your much celebrated piano concerto .
how did you come to germany and how important has german music been in your career ? elliott carter : it was a time when the ford foundation and the berliner senate got to together to start what i think was called the deutsche austauschdienst -lrb- german exchange program -rrb- and they invited a number of artists - wh orden was one , i ca n't remember the rest .
you could stay there for a year .
we had a very good and interesting time . i 'd had an interest in germany since i was in college in 1920 and 1930 .
i use to go to germany - munich - hoping to learn german , but instead ended up going to wagner and mozart operas at the prinzregententheater . so i never really learned german .
i was more interested in the music than the language .
it is a country that i have greatly admired in many , many ways .
after all , most of the music i am interested in is german .
it has been an important part of my life . literature has had an incredible influence on you : proust , james joyce , thomas mann and the poetry of elizabeth bishop .
you once said literature helped you discover important aspects of music that you did n't find in compositions .
what do you mean by that ? well , of course literature deals with the actual physical world and the world that we see .
music is an imaginary thing ; in some ways it deals with what seems to be feelings and thoughts .
literature is much more concerned with how we think about the world around us , while music is much more " innerlich " -lrb- internal -rrb- . what advice would you give young composers today ? young composers should always do what they love to do .
if they love to make money , that 's one way of writing music .
and the other one is if they like to write notes . is there a difference ? of course there is , because if you really want to make money then you have to write for a large public .
if you write notes then you have to write what you think is good and hope that other people will like it .
we are all composers that are a result of a good deal of training and that training consisted partly of understanding what audiences expect .
and so as a result , the relationship of the composer to the audience is a built-in thing when you become a professional . then , of course , it does n't mean that all the audience will like it . here we are all taught to write fugues - but then who in that audience will know what a fugue is ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.06.2009 birth control pill for men could be available soon , says who großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the contraceptive reduces sperm count by up to 100 percent , say researchers women have been awaiting it for years , and , according to researchers , it looks like the pill for men is finally in sight .
the other good news is that is does n't seem to have any side-effects . the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is currently testing a hormonal birth control pill for men .
michael zitzman , who is heading the study , told deutsche welle that it will likely be available to the public in 2012 at the earliest . deutsche welle : mr. zitzman , would you take the pill for men yourself ? prof. michael zitzman : yes , of course . why is everyone making such a big deal about this pill for men when it is n't even a pill ? it 's kind of like a product name , because the pill for women is so well known .
there 's never been an oral pill for men that can bring the same result as it does for women .
men have had to use shots , implants , and gels that are applied on the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael zitzmann heads the who study so how does the pill for men actually work ? with this hormonal form of contraception for men , natural testosterone is applied together with gestagen , which is a precursor of testosterone .
the goal is to completely suppress the hormones that stimulate the production of sperm in the testicles . how much testosterone and gestagen is needed ? the patient takes the dose that used for men who 've had a testicular disease , for example , and need to take replacement hormones .
they have to take extra testosterone to avoid side-effects like depression , osteoporoses or anaemia . is there a recommended dose ? 1,000 milligrams .
that 's about 1 gram of testosterone every two months . you 've said that sperm production is reduced by up to 100 percent .
but that 's not irreversible , is it ? no , of course not .
if that were the case then you might as well just have a vasectomy .
this method is completely reversible - that 's been the case with all the men tested .
it takes about four months , or sometimes only two , for the sperm to build up again . it takes the same amount of time for the sperm to disappear , since they go through a maturing process in the testicles .
once this process has begun , then their independent of the hormones .
that means that the sperm continue to develop without any hormones .
in the study , we noticed that after 4 weeks the sperm had disappeared in some of the men .
it usually takes two to four months , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pill will not affect appearance , say researchers does the additional testosterone change the man 's body in any way ?
testosterone is usually associated with muscles , body builders , and doping . it depends on dose of the hormone .
when a healthy man is given the same dose of testosterone that he would normally produce , then his body automatically reduces its own production of the hormone and the sperm count drops .
that means that his hormone levels do n't change and neither do his appearance or health . how far along is this study ?
the idea of a birth control pill for men has been around for a while now , and there have been lots of research projects … it has been around for a while .
the first thing we had to do was to figure out how everything works .
how well does it work and what are the side effects ?
the side effects that had been reported came from studies where placebos were used , which means some of the men received fake medication . the side-effects all resulted from placebo-niveau .
some of the men felt poorly or had trouble sleeping , but that probably had nothing to do with the actual medication .
it might have just been a side-effect of knowing they were taking part in a study , or it could also have just been a coincidence . so there are no side effects ? the only side-effect is that the testicles shrink a bit , because they stop working .
however , they return to their normal size when the men stop taking the pill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers do n't know if the pill for men appeals to couples when can we expect to see the birth control pill for men on the market ? that depends on how the pharmaceutical industry sees it and whether the world health organization receives a license .
i think that the study by the world health organization will be successful since we already know from past studies that it works . what we still need to find out is what couples think of this method .
do they feel good about it ?
i ca n't answer that just yet , because we still need to find the answer to that .
we think that , if everything goes well , the pill could be on the market as early as 2012 or 2013 . is the pharmaceutical industry interested ? yes , because the substances that are needed for the pill are already on the market .
they 've been permitted for other uses and the authorities would just have to approve them for the pill for men .
then the industry could put it on the market relatively quickly . interview : judith hartl -lrb- km -rrb- edited by : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" under these circumstances the commission has no alternative but open legal proceedings against germany , " the eu commission said in a statement . following a 2006 eu decision – also carried by germany – all data on the recipients of agricultural subsidies must be published on the internet since the beginning of may . germany , which receives about 5.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- in agricultural subisidies from brussels each year , was the last country in the 27-nation eu to publish the names of beneficiaries of farm aid with a six-week delay in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers have a powerful lobby in germany , especially those from bavaria however , bavaria – a german state that has a powerful farmers lobby and a long history of antagonizing berlin and brussels - has been withholding data on the grounds that brussels ' demands were in breach of data protection laws , sparking a legal battle with the eu judiciary .
the bavarian agricultural ministry said it would withhold data on bavarian farmers until the european court has ruled on the legality of the move .
germany now has a month to respond before brussels takes further steps , which could result in a court case at the european court of justice and heavy fines . milking the eu cash cow the issue of agricultural subsidies has been a touchy business for decades , but recently things came to a head when it emerged that some recipients in germany are not farmers in the traditional sense , but millionaires , big corporations , or even organizations that have no links to agriculture . reinhild benning , an activist with the german environmental group bund , has taken a closer look at how the eu farm aid has been spent in germany . she found out that the german airline , lufthansa , has been receiving subsidies for dairy products it serves its passengers on transcontinental flights .
" under eu rules this constitutes an export for which the airline absurdly receives export subsidies to the tune of two-and-a-half-million euros , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agricultural subsidies do not always end up where they 're most needed another example of questionable eu subsidies , she said , were 500,000 euros in annual subsidies received by the german energy giant rwe for measures aimed at re-cultivating coalmining areas in eastern germany .
the german dairy company muellermilch , she added , was able to milk the eu cash cow for a new creamery it built in the eastern german state of saxony .
" while building the new plant , muellermilch closed two of its older ones in western germany - on balance , the eu spent 70 million euros to enable the company to scrap 17 jobs , " benning said . privacy v. transparency the obligation to make the payments transparent dates from a bitterly contested reform of the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- in 2006 .
at the time , notably britain demanded greater accountability with regard to farm subsidies which eat up some 40 percent of the eu ’ s annual budget .
however , critics say the publication of names and amounts is a violation of privacy rules .
" i would have preferred a solution in which the names of major recipients only are disclosed " , peter schaar , the german commissioner for data protection , said .
schaar said it would have been better to determine a limit for subsidies above which recipients would be obliged to disclose full details .

the north west cancer intelligence service said their lives would be prolonged if uk cancer survival rates matched the best in europe and the us .
researchers said delays in diagnosing cancer in the uk and poorer treatment after diagnosis may be to blame .
the government 's national cancer director said urgent action was needed over the study 's findings .
possible reasons more invasive cancers later diagnosis , either through delays by the patient or the nhs poorer treatments patient decision to avoid intensive therapies cancer survival rates are calculated on the basis of those who are alive five years after diagnosis .
the researchers , who will present their findings to the national cancer intelligence network , said the number of under-75s dying in the uk was down , but little progress had been made among over-75s and the gap with other countries is growing .
lifestyles research into breast cancer survival rates , for example , shows that women aged over 75 have a lower chance of survival than for all ages , a difference which does not appear to be explained by their age alone .
18 months before diagnosis maryam valantin 's mother , mahin joulaie , was told she had advanced ovarian cancer at the age of 74 " mum started to have bleeding early in 2007 .
she went to the gp , but they just took her off her hrt and sent her to a gynaecologist .
he said it was probably just stress .
it was only when she went back to visit family in iran and saw a doctor there that she was diagnosed .
they did a scan and found a large lump in her fallopian tube .
when she came back to the uk , doctors found the cancer had spread to one of her lymph glands .
it was the size of a tennis ball .
she then had a six-week wait before having a hysterectomy and then chemo .
her treatment was very good , but the diagnosis was abysmal .
if it had been found 18 months earlier , it could have been removed easily and she would n't have needed a hysterectomy or chemo . "
dr tony moran , lead researcher from the north west cancer intelligence service , said elderly cancer patients did not appear to be benefitting from the improvements in treatments in the last decade .
he calculated that if the uk was performing as well as western europe in the age group 75-84 , and as well as the us in the 85 and over age group , there would be 15,000 fewer cancer deaths among the elderly every year .
at present , 75,000 over-75s die every year of cancer .
most worryingly , uk cancer deaths in the over-85s went up by 2 % over an eight-year period , while in western europe they went down by 16 % .
possible reasons include the uk being more susceptible to certain cancers related to the way we live , but many experts think it unlikely given the similarities in western lifestyle and diet .
the other possibilities include later diagnosis , and poorer treatment once that diagnosis has been reached .
" the circumstantial evidence does suggest later diagnosis , " said dr moran .
" but there are many stages where these delays may occur - the patient , the gp or the hospital . "
there are surveys which indicate a lack of awareness that the chances of developing cancer increase with age , and also the notion that a " stiff upper lip " mentality may prevent some of the older generation seeking advice .
it has also been suggested that some doctors and patients may together conclude that intensive therapy is not the best option given the toxic side-effects .
" the point is we do n't know why this is happening , " said dr moran .
" elderly cancer survival is an area which has been grossly neglected .
it is crying out for research . "
from the today programme more from today programme professor mike richards , national cancer director , said : " this is an important study and urgent action needs to be taken on the findings .
" we need to ensure that cancer patients of all ages are diagnosed as early as possible and receive appropriate treatment .
" the findings have already been shared with the national cancer equality initiative and we will be working with the nhs and other interested parties to tackle any age inequalities . "
drug trials michelle mitchell , charity director for age concern and help the aged said : " people over 65 are hugely under-represented in trials of cancer drugs , despite the fact that the majority of cancers occur in older people . "
this country offers some of the finest treatment and support in the world and it is scandalous that not everyone is getting this " mike hobday macmillan cancer support fund " this means that clinicians do n't have good information on which drugs are most effective and well-tolerated in older people with cancer .
" if the uk wants to improve its cancer mortality rates among over 75s , it should start by giving older people fairer access to clinical trials and extending the upper age limits for bowel and breast screening services . "
mike hobday , head of policy at macmillan cancer support : " it is appalling that people over 75 are not getting the care they need from the nhs .
" with an ageing population , the numbers of people getting cancer are increasing year on year .
" this country offers some of the finest treatment and support in the world and it is scandalous that not everyone is getting this . "

the north west cancer intelligence service said their lives would be prolonged if uk cancer survival rates matched the best in europe and the us .
researchers said delays in diagnosing cancer in the uk and poorer treatment after diagnosis may be to blame .
the government 's national cancer director said urgent action was needed over the study 's findings .
possible reasons more invasive cancers later diagnosis , either through delays by the patient or the nhs poorer treatments patient decision to avoid intensive therapies cancer survival rates are calculated on the basis of those who are alive five years after diagnosis .
the researchers , who will present their findings to the national cancer intelligence network , said the number of under-75s dying in the uk was down , but little progress had been made among over-75s and the gap with other countries is growing .
lifestyles research into breast cancer survival rates , for example , shows that women aged over 75 have a lower chance of survival than for all ages , a difference which does not appear to be explained by their age alone .
18 months before diagnosis maryam valantin 's mother , mahin joulaie , was told she had advanced ovarian cancer at the age of 74 " mum started to have bleeding early in 2007 .
she went to the gp , but they just took her off her hrt and sent her to a gynaecologist .
he said it was probably just stress .
it was only when she went back to visit family in iran and saw a doctor there that she was diagnosed .
they did a scan and found a large lump in her fallopian tube .
when she came back to the uk , doctors found the cancer had spread to one of her lymph glands .
it was the size of a tennis ball .
she then had a six-week wait before having a hysterectomy and then chemo .
her treatment was very good , but the diagnosis was abysmal .
if it had been found 18 months earlier , it could have been removed easily and she would n't have needed a hysterectomy or chemo . "
dr tony moran , lead researcher from the north west cancer intelligence service , said elderly cancer patients did not appear to be benefitting from the improvements in treatments in the last decade .
he calculated that if the uk was performing as well as western europe in the age group 75-84 , and as well as the us in the 85 and over age group , there would be 15,000 fewer cancer deaths among the elderly every year .
at present , 75,000 over-75s die every year of cancer .
most worryingly , uk cancer deaths in the over-85s went up by 2 % over an eight-year period , while in western europe they went down by 16 % .
possible reasons include the uk being more susceptible to certain cancers related to the way we live , but many experts think it unlikely given the similarities in western lifestyle and diet .
the other possibilities include later diagnosis , and poorer treatment once that diagnosis has been reached .
" the circumstantial evidence does suggest later diagnosis , " said dr moran .
" but there are many stages where these delays may occur - the patient , the gp or the hospital . "
there are surveys which indicate a lack of awareness that the chances of developing cancer increase with age , and also the notion that a " stiff upper lip " mentality may prevent some of the older generation seeking advice .
it has also been suggested that some doctors and patients may together conclude that intensive therapy is not the best option given the toxic side-effects .
" the point is we do n't know why this is happening , " said dr moran .
" elderly cancer survival is an area which has been grossly neglected .
it is crying out for research . "

at present , 75,000 over-75s die every year of cancer .
most worryingly , uk cancer deaths in the over-85s went up by 2 % over an eight-year period , while in western europe they went down by 16 % .
possible reasons include the uk being more susceptible to certain cancers related to the way we live , but many experts think it unlikely given the similarities in western lifestyle and diet .
the other possibilities include later diagnosis , and poorer treatment once that diagnosis has been reached .
" the circumstantial evidence does suggest later diagnosis , " said dr moran .
" but there are many stages where these delays may occur - the patient , the gp or the hospital . "
there are surveys which indicate a lack of awareness that the chances of developing cancer increase with age , and also the notion that a " stiff upper lip " mentality may prevent some of the older generation seeking advice .
it has also been suggested that some doctors and patients may together conclude that intensive therapy is not the best option given the toxic side-effects .
" the point is we do n't know why this is happening , " said dr moran .
" elderly cancer survival is an area which has been grossly neglected .
it is crying out for research . "

more from today programme professor mike richards , national cancer director , said : " this is an important study and urgent action needs to be taken on the findings .
" we need to ensure that cancer patients of all ages are diagnosed as early as possible and receive appropriate treatment .
" the findings have already been shared with the national cancer equality initiative and we will be working with the nhs and other interested parties to tackle any age inequalities . "
drug trials michelle mitchell , charity director for age concern and help the aged said : " people over 65 are hugely under-represented in trials of cancer drugs , despite the fact that the majority of cancers occur in older people .
this country offers some of the finest treatment and support in the world and it is scandalous that not everyone is getting this mike hobday macmillan cancer support fund " this means that clinicians do n't have good information on which drugs are most effective and well-tolerated in older people with cancer .
" if the uk wants to improve its cancer mortality rates among over 75s , it should start by giving older people fairer access to clinical trials and extending the upper age limits for bowel and breast screening services . "
mike hobday , head of policy at macmillan cancer support : " it is appalling that people over 75 are not getting the care they need from the nhs .
" with an ageing population , the numbers of people getting cancer are increasing year on year .
" this country offers some of the finest treatment and support in the world and it is scandalous that not everyone is getting this . "
but professor alan maryon-davis , president of the uk faculty of public health , said : " as usual the people mostly missing out are from our most deprived communities .
that 's where the real cancer gap is . "

eating disorder sufferer rebekah dowell : " i felt ... like no-one wanted to help me " doctors are calling for an urgent review of adolescent healthcare because they say too many young people are getting lost in the system .
they say there are problems treating 16 to 18-year-olds with both mental and physical illnesses .
the royal college of gps wants more targeted provision for teenagers .
care services minister phil hope said : " mental health services have improved a lot in recent years , but we know we need to do more . "
experts say healthcare for teenagers is patchy and often there is an additional problem with the transition between child , adolescent and adult services .
i felt like no-one wanted to help me , and i lost a lot of weight rebekah dowell professor steve field , chairman of the royal college of gps , said : " the handover between child and adult services is not done very well in most places . "
getting healthcare can also be difficult because symptoms are often hidden even from close family members and advice from doctors is often ignored .
some of the areas highlighted by gps involve the treatment of conditions like diabetes and asthma .
but this age group is particularly vulnerable to mental health problems such as anorexia .
many of those suffering from eating disorders say they still have to wait months for treatment and when it comes it is inappropriate .
sometimes under-18s are still treated on adult psychiatric wards .
' living hell ' hannah bliverstone , 17 , from hertfordshire , is critical of the treatment she received for an eating disorder .
the teenager said she did get the care she needed after becoming desperately ill .
however she became so weak that she could not walk and instead had to shuffle along the ground .
it was a year before hannah got any specialist help for her eating disorder .
even then she had to move between three different hospitals .
she said : " at my most needy i was not given the correct treatment .
my life became a living hell .
i lost two years of my life .
i was consumed by my illness .
i do n't want others to suffer in the same way . "
meanwhile rebekah dowell , from liverpool , said that in the crucial month when she needed urgent treatment for anorexia , different authorities argued about whose responsibility she was .
she said : " i wanted to go into hospital and i wanted the treatment .
but i was getting stressed about it .
i felt like no-one wanted to help me and i lost a lot of weight . "
joined up it is hard to generalise about the correct way to treat serious teenage health problems .
what is appropriate will depend on the individual and the specifics of every case .
some doctors argue that decisions can be taken only at a local level , but all agree on the importance of a joined up approach - which involves gps , specialist centres , families and community outreach teams .
in some areas this is happening already .
in haywards heath , west sussex , the new chalkhill centre recently opened for the treatment of acute mental health problems .
under the same roof , young patients have access to a range of services - from education and sporting activities to treatment itself .
there are in-patient beds for admitting the most serious cases , but the focus is on spotting problems early .
tim gillett , the psychiatrist at chalkhill , said : " we want to put resources at an earlier level .
we also want to develop community resources .
that 's our strategy . "
it is something the government says it wants to support .
funding for child and adolescent mental health in england has increased substantially .
a national advisory council has been set up to address the transition from child to adult services .

official figures show the number of households considered homeless has dropped by 21 % , compared to the same period last year .
but shelter cymru director , john puzey , says the number of requests for help from his organisation is increasing .
it comes as the assembly government unveiled its plans to assist homeowners facing house repossession .
the mortgage rescue action plan pledges easier access to debt advice , training for front-line housing staff , and what the assembly government said was the development of a new " national financial inclusion " strategy .
the deputy minister for housing , jocelyn davies said : " the growing number of repossessions is a matter of concern for us .
' at risk ' " we are working hard to try to minimise the impact in wales and to support families and individuals who are faced with extremely difficult circumstances .
i hope that this plan will help them to find the help they need . "
but with an estimated 2,250 repossessions anticipated by the end of 2009 , shelter cymru said it feared the current trend in the fall of homeless families could be reversed .
latest figures released show that 1,334 households are considered to be homeless in wales at the end of march .
it is a 7 % drop from the last quarter of 2008 , and down just over a fifth from the level in january to march 2008 .
the number of households in temporary accommodation has also fallen slightly , to 2,823 .
" unfortunately , i think these figures are the bottom of the trend , and we will see an increase in the number of people losing their homes , " warned the shelter cymru director .
" people in difficulty due to the recession , those who have lost their jobs , they are really struggling to hold on to their homes .
" we are seeing people here who are in mortgage arrears , and they are telling us that they are trying everything to keep their home , but they are running out of options . "
his comments comes as shelter cymru holds its annual conference in swansea , where themes include examining proposals for a 10-year homelessness plan currently being prepared by the assembly government .
" we need to ask whether we can deliver that plan , and whether we can deliver it without additional resources , " added mr puzey .
focus another theme will be tackling bureaucracy in homelessness services .
mr puzey said he felt that too often , local authorities across wales invested too much time and energy in form-filling and assessing homeless individuals .
" perhaps the focus should move more to actually finding homes for these people , " he said .
the conference will include workshops with the dutch action group , the kafka brigade , a non-profit organisation that sets out to challenge overpowering officialdom .
" they will be on hand to outline their unique approach to cutting through red tape , " added mr puzey .

official figures show the number of households considered homeless has dropped by 21 % , compared to the same period last year .
but shelter cymru director , john puzey , says the number of requests for help from his organisation is increasing .
it comes as the assembly government unveiled its plans to assist homeowners facing house repossession .
the mortgage rescue action plan pledges easier access to debt advice , training for front-line housing staff , and what the assembly government said was the development of a new " national financial inclusion " strategy .
the deputy minister for housing , jocelyn davies said : " the growing number of repossessions is a matter of concern for us .
' at risk ' " we are working hard to try to minimise the impact in wales and to support families and individuals who are faced with extremely difficult circumstances .
i hope that this plan will help them to find the help they need . "
but with an estimated 2,250 repossessions anticipated by the end of 2009 , shelter cymru said it feared the current trend in the fall of homeless families could be reversed .
latest figures released show that 1,334 households are considered to be homeless in wales at the end of march .
it is a 7 % drop from the last quarter of 2008 , and down just over a fifth from the level in january to march 2008 .
the number of households in temporary accommodation has also fallen slightly , to 2,823 .
" unfortunately , i think these figures are the bottom of the trend , and we will see an increase in the number of people losing their homes , " warned the shelter cymru director .
" people in difficulty due to the recession , those who have lost their jobs , they are really struggling to hold on to their homes .
" we are seeing people here who are in mortgage arrears , and they are telling us that they are trying everything to keep their home , but they are running out of options . "
his comments comes as shelter cymru holds its annual conference in swansea , where themes include examining proposals for a 10-year homelessness plan currently being prepared by the assembly government .
" we need to ask whether we can deliver that plan , and whether we can deliver it without additional resources , " added mr puzey .
focus another theme will be tackling bureaucracy in homelessness services .
mr puzey said he felt that too often , local authorities across wales invested too much time and energy in form-filling and assessing homeless individuals .
" perhaps the focus should move more to actually finding homes for these people , " he said .
the conference will include workshops with the dutch action group , the kafka brigade , a non-profit organisation that sets out to challenge overpowering officialdom .
" they will be on hand to outline their unique approach to cutting through red tape , " added mr puzey .

as well as hosting rugby and football matches , some of the biggest names in music have played to huge crowds .
earlier this month more than 120,000 take that fans descended on the welsh capital for two sell-out shows .
the hotel industry said nearby cities such as swansea and bristol benefited from visitors it attracted as well .
the stadium is owned and operated by the welsh rugby union -lrb- wru -rrb- .
finance director steve phillips said it was the biggest tourist attraction in wales and among the top 10 in the uk .
a study commissioned by the wru and published in november 2007 estimated the financial benefit to the welsh economy to be in excess of £ 105m a year .
take that , bought this ...
concert goers ate 3,000 hospitality meals at the stadium they consumed nearly 1,000kg of chocolate and 7,000 portions of pizza the stadium sold 4,000 glasses of pimms source : millennium stadium it found 85 % of the money stayed in the cardiff area and was thought to support up to 2,400 full time jobs a year .
mr phillips said : " the millennium stadium has attracted more than one billion pounds into the welsh economy in its first 10 years .
" visitors attracted to the stadium number over 1m a year with almost half of them from outside wales .
" this makes us far and away the premier tourist attraction in wales and easily within the uk top ten , one of only a handful of attractions outside london of this scale .
" there is plenty for us to celebrate in the 10th anniversary year .
" our event calendar is as strong as ever with the recent take that concert the perfect example of the power of the venue in attracting visitor numbers to cardiff and wales .
" our concert business has never been better and the important thing we have now established , over the ten year history of our venue , is a consistent ability to attract and successfully deliver the biggest acts . "
derek harvey , chairman of the cardiff hoteliers ' association , said the stadium had played a big part in the regeneration of the city .
" when there is an event there it has a massive impact on the city , " he added .
" it 's a unique facility - one because it is in the centre of the city and two because the roof closes .
when the stadium bids for concerts there is less of a risk for promoters .
" the unmeasurable is the amount of media coverage it attracts for wales and the city of cardiff , " he added .
mr harvey said that was particularly the case when it hosted the fa cup finals and semi-finals while wembley was being rebuild .
and he said with certain events - such as the six nations rugby - then cities such as swansea and bristol saw increased visitor number as well .
the stadium , with not all stands ready , opened on 26 june 1999 with the welsh rugby team playing - and beating - south africa .
later that year wales hosted the rugby world cup , and have enjoyed two grand slams since .
the stadium also hosted the fa cup , league cup and play-off finals while wembley was rebuilt .
meanwhile rock and pop giants ranging from u2 , bruce springsteen to oasis and madonna have played at the stadium .
there has also been speedway , rugby league , rallying and monster truck racing .
to mark its 10th anniversary , the stadium has a re-designed logo for the coming season .
it will first be seen on tickets for the rugby international against new zealand in november .
we asked for your favourite memory or event at the millennium stadium over the last 10 years .
here is a selection of your comments .
hard to choose between the 2 grand slam afternoons of 2005 and 2008 but i think the latter shades it - shane williams ' try sealing the win and him becoming wales ' record tryscorer in the process .
good times !
rob , neath , south wales watching cardiff win the play off final was an amazing experience and to do it at in our home city ... priceless ben , cardiff , south wales opening game vs. the boks .
wales ' only victory against them .
especially as me misses is a safa and it 's the only time i 've been able to gloat .
plus , it is topical and on current form ca n't see the lions winning a test. mark , wrexham i have two mega memories !
the opening match when wales beat south africa and the stadium was only partially finished and wales beating ireland for the grand slam in gorgeous spring sunshine .

the stadium is a wonderful facility and i just hope they get to complete the bowl and increase capacity so more people can enjoy this amazing place : happy days !
matt , cardiff yes i 'd have to agree that the 2008 grand slam match against france was right up there and both the tries from shane and martyn were scored right in front of us as well , it 's does n't get much better than that .
and any victory over england is always special . : - -rrb- also worth a mention was the 2 - 1 win over italy in the euro 2004 qualifiers in october 2002 .
dai , cardiff firstly - best stadium in the world !
have been to the stadium over 50 times and seen rugby grand slams won , fa cup finals , welsh football games -lrb- including that one against italy -rrb- , concerts and even abseiled off the roof ! - but the best atmosphere i ever experienced was when the welsh team stood up to the haka last year .
the noise generated from the crowd on that occasion when the teams just stood eyeball to eyeball was immense and to see the all blacks walk away was priceless . - pity the game went all downhill from there ! !
ben , cardiff even smaller scale events can be memorable .
i watched wrexham fc beat southend utd and pick the ldv trophy with large support from wrexham and north wales.which was in my experience .
their greatest achievement in my eyes .

had just got back from australia , having watched the scotland match in adelaide and the ireland match in sydney , and was still very jet-lagged .
the atmosphere was incredible before and during the game , but when we won it went to a whole new level which kept me going until alcohol and jet lag made me nearly fall asleep into my chinese meal at a restaurant where the supporters were still singing hours after the game had finished .
robert , weston-super-mare on a par with the new wembley , seen oasis here , magnificent venue , up there as one of the best ever .
calvin , edinburgh , two favourites .
the first visit to the stadium with my son to watch samoa and the standoff against nz last autumn .

calvin , edinburgh .
watching joe calzaghe beat mikkel kessler to unify the sm title and remain undeated for 11 years as world champion in front of 50,000 .
awesome night !
andrew , cardiff my favourite memories must include beating the boks in the first game at the stadium and then getting a ticket 5 minutes before the opening world cup game for the seats they had forgotten to sell !
being there the day we won 2005 grand slam was unbelievable and also seeing gav kick that kick against england !
but i must n't forget the wonderful concerts including the manics , the phonics & take that !
chrissie , haarlem , netherlands take that this year and 2006 were brilliant at the stadium .
the atmosphere was great !
very fortunate to have such a fab venue so near to us .
karen , tredegar , south wales as a wrexham girl it has to be watching the dragons there winning the ldv vans trophy final in 2005 .
from my arm chair though , i very much enjoyed liverpool 's 2 fa cup triumphs of 2001 and 2006 , and of course the unforgettable grand slam winning games from 2005 and 2008 .
u2 were pretty amazing there too , i hope they will be again this coming august .
liz , stourport-on-severn , england to see our soldiers marching ito the stadium after finishing their tour of iraq , seeing them recieve theor well deserved medals sally adams , swansea best would be beating italy 2-1 on 16th october 2002 , a date and game carved into my memory for ever .
also , i saw the greatest bit of footballing ever in the man united vs arsenal charity shield .
viera had picked up the ball at the half way line and was moving to goal , out of the corner of your eye you see keane running and running , all the man united supporters stand up in anticipation , to see keane slide into viera , viera down and keane back up in an instant running with the ball .
the fans celebrated like it was a match winning goal .
magnificent .
great great stadium rich davies , isle of man i 'm a red scouser living in cardiff .
wish i 'd been here for michael owen 's winner in 2001 and stevie gerrard 's in 2006 .
give me the millennium stadium over wembley any time .
neil , cardiff , wales watching wales response to the haka in 2008 and wales winning the grand slam and beating england gavin clement , ystrad rhondda truly great stadium .
shame that they failed to promote rugby league , hence the move to murrayfield for magic weekend - ask most " northerners " and they would prefer to play all the major rugby league finals in cardiff !
how much money did cardiff lose by not hosting millennium magic this year ?
millions i guess !

as well as hosting rugby and football matches , some of the biggest names in music have played to huge crowds .
earlier this month more than 120,000 take that fans descended on the welsh capital for two sell-out shows .
the hotel industry said nearby cities such as swansea and bristol benefited from visitors it attracted as well .
the stadium is owned and operated by the welsh rugby union -lrb- wru -rrb- .
finance director steve phillips said it was the biggest tourist attraction in wales and among the top 10 in the uk .
a study commissioned by the wru and published in november 2007 estimated the financial benefit to the welsh economy to be in excess of £ 105m a year .
take that , bought this ...
concert goers ate 3,000 hospitality meals at the stadium they consumed nearly 1,000kg of chocolate and 7,000 portions of pizza the stadium sold 4,000 glasses of pimms source : millennium stadium it found 85 % of the money stayed in the cardiff area and was thought to support up to 2,400 full time jobs a year .
mr phillips said : " the millennium stadium has attracted more than one billion pounds into the welsh economy in its first 10 years .
" visitors attracted to the stadium number over 1m a year with almost half of them from outside wales .
" this makes us far and away the premier tourist attraction in wales and easily within the uk top ten , one of only a handful of attractions outside london of this scale .
" there is plenty for us to celebrate in the 10th anniversary year .
" our event calendar is as strong as ever with the recent take that concert the perfect example of the power of the venue in attracting visitor numbers to cardiff and wales .
" our concert business has never been better and the important thing we have now established , over the ten year history of our venue , is a consistent ability to attract and successfully deliver the biggest acts . "
derek harvey , chairman of the cardiff hoteliers ' association , said the stadium had played a big part in the regeneration of the city .
" when there is an event there it has a massive impact on the city , " he added .
the millennium stadium 's retractable roof has given it versatility as a venue enlarge image " it 's a unique facility - one because it is in the centre of the city and two because the roof closes .
when the stadium bids for concerts there is less of a risk for promoters .
" the unmeasurable is the amount of media coverage it attracts for wales and the city of cardiff , " he added .
mr harvey said that was particularly the case when it hosted the fa cup finals and semi-finals while wembley was being rebuild .
and he said with certain events - such as the six nations rugby - then cities such as swansea and bristol saw increased visitor number as well .
the stadium , with not all stands ready , opened on 26 june 1999 with the welsh rugby team playing - and beating - south africa .
later that year wales hosted the rugby world cup , and have enjoyed two grand slams since .
the stadium also hosted the fa cup , league cup and play-off finals while wembley was rebuilt .
meanwhile rock and pop giants ranging from u2 , bruce springsteen to oasis and madonna have played at the stadium .
there has also been speedway , rugby league , rallying and monster truck racing .
to mark its 10th anniversary , the stadium has a re-designed logo for the coming season .
it will first be seen on tickets for the rugby international against new zealand in november .
we asked for your favourite memory or event at the millennium stadium over the last 10 years .
here is a selection of your comments .
wales celebrate the 2005 grand slam at the stadium hard to choose between the 2 grand slam afternoons of 2005 and 2008 but i think the latter shades it - shane williams ' try sealing the win and him becoming wales ' record tryscorer in the process .
good times !
rob , neath , south wales watching cardiff win the play off final was an amazing experience and to do it at in our home city ... priceless ben , cardiff , south wales opening game vs. the boks .

especially as me misses is a safa and it 's the only time i 've been able to gloat .
plus , it is topical and on current form ca n't see the lions winning a test. mark , wrexham i have two mega memories !
the opening match when wales beat south africa and the stadium was only partially finished and wales beating ireland for the grand slam in gorgeous spring sunshine .

have been to the stadium over 50 times and seen rugby grand slams won , fa cup finals , welsh football games -lrb- including that one against italy -rrb- , concerts and even abseiled off the roof ! - but the best atmosphere i ever experienced was when the welsh team stood up to the haka last year .

andrew , cardiff my favourite memories must include beating the boks in the first game at the stadium and then getting a ticket 5 minutes before the opening world cup game for the seats they had forgotten to sell !
being there the day we won 2005 grand slam was unbelievable and also seeing gav kick that kick against england !
but i must n't forget the wonderful concerts including the manics , the phonics & take that !
chrissie , haarlem , netherlands take that this year and 2006 were brilliant at the stadium .
the atmosphere was great !
very fortunate to have such a fab venue so near to us .
karen , tredegar , south wales as a wrexham girl it has to be watching the dragons there winning the ldv vans trophy final in 2005 .
from my arm chair though , i very much enjoyed liverpool 's 2 fa cup triumphs of 2001 and 2006 , and of course the unforgettable grand slam winning games from 2005 and 2008 .
u2 were pretty amazing there too , i hope they will be again this coming august .
liz , stourport-on-severn , england to see our soldiers marching ito the stadium after finishing their tour of iraq , seeing them recieve theor well deserved medals sally adams , swansea best would be beating italy 2-1 on 16th october 2002 , a date and game carved into my memory for ever .
also , i saw the greatest bit of footballing ever in the man united vs arsenal charity shield .
viera had picked up the ball at the half way line and was moving to goal , out of the corner of your eye you see keane running and running , all the man united supporters stand up in anticipation , to see keane slide into viera , viera down and keane back up in an instant running with the ball .
the fans celebrated like it was a match winning goal .
magnificent .
great great stadium rich davies , isle of man i 'm a red scouser living in cardiff .
wish i 'd been here for michael owen 's winner in 2001 and stevie gerrard 's in 2006 .
give me the millennium stadium over wembley any time .
neil , cardiff , wales watching wales response to the haka in 2008 and wales winning the grand slam and beating england gavin clement , ystrad rhondda truly great stadium .
shame that they failed to promote rugby league , hence the move to murrayfield for magic weekend - ask most " northerners " and they would prefer to play all the major rugby league finals in cardiff !
how much money did cardiff lose by not hosting millennium magic this year ?
millions i guess !

as well as hosting rugby and football matches , some of the biggest names in music have played to huge crowds .
earlier this month more than 120,000 take that fans descended on the welsh capital for two sell-out shows .
the hotel industry said nearby cities such as swansea and bristol benefited from visitors it attracted as well .
the stadium is owned and operated by the welsh rugby union -lrb- wru -rrb- .
finance director steve phillips said it was the biggest tourist attraction in wales and among the top 10 in the uk .
a study commissioned by the wru and published in november 2007 estimated the financial benefit to the welsh economy to be in excess of £ 105m a year .
take that , bought this ...
concert goers ate 3,000 hospitality meals at the stadium they consumed nearly 1,000kg of chocolate and 7,000 portions of pizza the stadium sold 4,000 glasses of pimms source : millennium stadium it found 85 % of the money stayed in the cardiff area and was thought to support up to 2,400 full time jobs a year .
mr phillips said : " the millennium stadium has attracted more than one billion pounds into the welsh economy in its first 10 years .
" visitors attracted to the stadium number over 1m a year with almost half of them from outside wales .
" this makes us far and away the premier tourist attraction in wales and easily within the uk top ten , one of only a handful of attractions outside london of this scale .
" there is plenty for us to celebrate in the 10th anniversary year .
" our event calendar is as strong as ever with the recent take that concert the perfect example of the power of the venue in attracting visitor numbers to cardiff and wales .
" our concert business has never been better and the important thing we have now established , over the ten year history of our venue , is a consistent ability to attract and successfully deliver the biggest acts . "
derek harvey , chairman of the cardiff hoteliers ' association , said the stadium had played a big part in the regeneration of the city .
" when there is an event there it has a massive impact on the city , " he added .
the millennium stadium 's retractable roof has given it versatility as a venue enlarge image " it 's a unique facility - one because it is in the centre of the city and two because the roof closes .
when the stadium bids for concerts there is less of a risk for promoters .
" the unmeasurable is the amount of media coverage it attracts for wales and the city of cardiff , " he added .
mr harvey said that was particularly the case when it hosted the fa cup finals and semi-finals while wembley was being rebuild .
and he said with certain events - such as the six nations rugby - then cities such as swansea and bristol saw increased visitor number as well .
the stadium , with not all stands ready , opened on 26 june 1999 with the welsh rugby team playing - and beating - south africa .
later that year wales hosted the rugby world cup , and have enjoyed two grand slams since .
the stadium also hosted the fa cup , league cup and play-off finals while wembley was rebuilt .
meanwhile rock and pop giants ranging from u2 , bruce springsteen to oasis and madonna have played at the stadium .
there has also been speedway , rugby league , rallying and monster truck racing .
to mark its 10th anniversary , the stadium has a re-designed logo for the coming season .
it will first be seen on tickets for the rugby international against new zealand in november .
we asked for your favourite memory or event at the millennium stadium over the last 10 years .
here is a selection of your comments .
wales celebrate the 2005 grand slam at the stadium hard to choose between the 2 grand slam afternoons of 2005 and 2008 but i think the latter shades it - shane williams ' try sealing the win and him becoming wales ' record tryscorer in the process .
good times !
rob , neath , south wales watching cardiff win the play off final was an amazing experience and to do it at in our home city ... priceless ben , cardiff , south wales opening game vs. the boks .

as well as hosting rugby and football matches , some of the biggest names in music have played to huge crowds .
earlier this month more than 120,000 take that fans descended on the welsh capital for two sell-out shows .
the hotel industry said nearby cities such as swansea and bristol benefited from visitors it attracted as well .
the stadium is owned and operated by the welsh rugby union -lrb- wru -rrb- .
finance director steve phillips said it was the biggest tourist attraction in wales and among the top 10 in the uk .
a study commissioned by the wru and published in november 2007 estimated the financial benefit to the welsh economy to be in excess of £ 105m a year .
take that , bought this ...
concert goers ate 3,000 hospitality meals at the stadium they consumed nearly 1,000kg of chocolate and 7,000 portions of pizza the stadium sold 4,000 glasses of pimms source : millennium stadium it found 85 % of the money stayed in the cardiff area and was thought to support up to 2,400 full time jobs a year .
mr phillips said : " the millennium stadium has attracted more than one billion pounds into the welsh economy in its first 10 years .
" visitors attracted to the stadium number over 1m a year with almost half of them from outside wales .
" this makes us far and away the premier tourist attraction in wales and easily within the uk top ten , one of only a handful of attractions outside london of this scale .
" there is plenty for us to celebrate in the 10th anniversary year .
" our event calendar is as strong as ever with the recent take that concert the perfect example of the power of the venue in attracting visitor numbers to cardiff and wales .
" our concert business has never been better and the important thing we have now established , over the ten year history of our venue , is a consistent ability to attract and successfully deliver the biggest acts . "
derek harvey , chairman of the cardiff hoteliers ' association , said the stadium had played a big part in the regeneration of the city .
" when there is an event there it has a massive impact on the city , " he added .
the millennium stadium 's retractable roof has given it versatility as a venue enlarge image " it 's a unique facility - one because it is in the centre of the city and two because the roof closes .
when the stadium bids for concerts there is less of a risk for promoters .
" the unmeasurable is the amount of media coverage it attracts for wales and the city of cardiff , " he added .
mr harvey said that was particularly the case when it hosted the fa cup finals and semi-finals while wembley was being rebuild .
and he said with certain events - such as the six nations rugby - then cities such as swansea and bristol saw increased visitor number as well .
the stadium , with not all stands ready , opened on 26 june 1999 with the welsh rugby team playing - and beating - south africa .
later that year wales hosted the rugby world cup , and have enjoyed two grand slams since .
the stadium also hosted the fa cup , league cup and play-off finals while wembley was rebuilt .
meanwhile rock and pop giants ranging from u2 , bruce springsteen to oasis and madonna have played at the stadium .
there has also been speedway , rugby league , rallying and monster truck racing .
to mark its 10th anniversary , the stadium has a re-designed logo for the coming season .
it will first be seen on tickets for the rugby international against new zealand in november .
we asked for your favourite memory or event at the millennium stadium over the last 10 years .
here is a selection of your comments .
wales celebrate the 2005 grand slam at the stadium hard to choose between the 2 grand slam afternoons of 2005 and 2008 but i think the latter shades it - shane williams ' try sealing the win and him becoming wales ' record tryscorer in the process .
good times !
rob , neath , south wales watching cardiff win the play off final was an amazing experience and to do it at in our home city ... priceless ben , cardiff , south wales opening game vs. the boks .

plus , it is topical and on current form ca n't see the lions winning a test. mark , wrexham i have two mega memories !

neil , cardiff , wales watching wales response to the haka in 2008 and wales winning the grand slam and beating england gavin clement , ystrad rhondda truly great stadium .
shame that they failed to promote rugby league , hence the move to murrayfield for magic weekend - ask most " northerners " and they would prefer to play all the major rugby league finals in cardiff !
how much money did cardiff lose by not hosting millennium magic this year ?
millions i guess !
