boonen had previously been banned by tour organizers for failing an out-of-competition cocaine test . the french court 's decision comes one day before the start of the 2009 tour de france in monaco .
according to boonen 's team quick step , the belgian will be a part of it 's nine-man tour de france team .
boonen tested positive for cocaine in an out-of-competition drug test in april .
it was the second positive cocaine test for boonen in a year .
boonen was barred from participating in last year 's tour de france as a result of the first positive test .
initially , tour de france organizers amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- banned boonen from participating in this year 's tour after the second failed drug test , but boonen appealed the decision .
on monday , a french civil court ruled that it not have jurisdiction in the case , and no decision was reached .
boonen 's lawyers then took the appeal before the french olympic committee 's arbitration panel , which issued its decision on friday .
boonen has still been riding and competing since the failed drug test .
last weekend , he won the belgian national cycling championships in aywaille , the first senior title of his career in his home country .
in 2005 , he was the world road race champion .
cycling 's governing body , uci , has decided not to take disciplinary action against boonen because the positive test did not occur during a competition period , and cocaine is not a banned substance between races. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pechstein is germany 's most successful winter olympian , having won nine medals overall - five of them gold – between 1992 and 2006 .
she is also a six-time world champion and has 25 minor medals from the worlds .
the isu said its decision was " based on the evidence of ms pechstein 's -lrb- sample -rrb- which included abnormal values and abnormal changes of values in a series of tests -lrb- in particular in the tests conducted during the essent isu world allround championships held in hamar on february 7-8 , 2009 -rrb- . "
pechstein was banned from february 9 , 2009 , until february 8 , 2011 , after the completion of a hearing on monday and tuesday .
as a result , she will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver , and , given her age , may end her career .
the isu said pechstein has chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport .
pechstein 's last title was the european all-round crown which she won in january in heerenveen , the netherlands .
she did not medal at the worlds in hamar , withdrawing after two of four events due to a fever. dfm / dpa / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .
“ it is important for us to reiterate our gleneagles commitments at the summit in italy .
it is central to our credibility , crucial for the nurture of our partnership with africa and an investment in the future .
setting priorities german chancellor angela merkel went some way to outlining that future in a pre-summit speech this week .
she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

pechstein is germany 's most successful winter olympian , having won nine medals overall - five of them gold – between 1992 and 2006 .
she is also a six-time world champion and has 25 minor medals from the worlds .
the isu said its decision was " based on the evidence of ms pechstein 's -lrb- sample -rrb- which included abnormal values and abnormal changes of values in a series of tests -lrb- in particular in the tests conducted during the essent isu world allround championships held in hamar on february 7-8 , 2009 -rrb- . "
pechstein was banned from february 9 , 2009 , until february 8 , 2011 , after the completion of a hearing on monday and tuesday .
as a result , she will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver , and , given her age , may end her career .
the isu said pechstein has chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport .
pechstein 's last title was the european all-round crown which she won in january in heerenveen , the netherlands .
she did not medal at the worlds in hamar , withdrawing after two of four events due to a fever. dfm / dpa / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk is accused of being an accessory to murder in 29,000 cases at the sobibor camp .
the retired auto worker denies having played a role in the holocaust , but german prosecutors have an ss identity card with a photograph of a young man said to be demjanjuk as well as written transcripts of witness testimony that place him at the camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 .
he was deported to germany after losing a court battle to stay in ohio , where he held us citizenship , and has been held in a jail near munich since may 12 . demjanjuk has been stripped of his us citizenship for lying about his past ; he is now stateless .
his case is to be transferred to the court this month , margarethe noetzel , a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor 's office said .
it was not immediately clear when the trial would start .

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pechstein is germany 's most successful winter olympian , having won nine medals overall - five of them gold – between 1992 and 2006 .
she is also a six-time world champion and has 25 minor medals from the worlds .
the isu said its decision was " based on the evidence of ms pechstein 's -lrb- sample -rrb- which included abnormal values and abnormal changes of values in a series of tests -lrb- in particular in the tests conducted during the essent isu world allround championships held in hamar on february 7-8 , 2009 -rrb- . "
pechstein was banned from february 9 , 2009 , until february 8 , 2011 , after the completion of a hearing on monday and tuesday .
as a result , she will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver , and , given her age , may end her career .
the isu said pechstein has chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport .
pechstein 's last title was the european all-round crown which she won in january in heerenveen , the netherlands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .

those laws concerned ensuring the german parliament in berlin had a say in formulating eu decisions made in brussels .
but the christian social union of bavaria -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party to merkel 's cdu , said friday they wanted even greater rights for the bundestag and bundesrat - the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively - enshrined in germany 's constitution .
the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .
" we generally want that the bundestag and the bundesrat must agree -lrb- to eu decisions before they impact germany -rrb- … and we want that parliament has the right to complain if it feels its rights have been affected , " said csu chairman horst seehofer .
the minister of state for europe at the german foreign office , guenter gloser , warned the csu against endangering the treaty 's ratification schedule .
merkel had said the necessary laws would be amended and the treaty passed before the september 27 federal election , but the latest demands from the csu could prolong the ratification process .
the bundestag is to hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified .
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted. dfm / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .
he also said the german taxpayer was most at risk from any savings bank losses because those institutions were backed by government guarantees .

" neither the worries nor miseries of affected employees are solved with this plan , nor can taxpayers really be assured , " said uwe foullong , a member of the ver.di board of directors .

boonen had previously been banned by tour organizers for failing an out-of-competition cocaine test . the french court 's decision comes one day before the start of the 2009 tour de france in monaco .
according to boonen 's team quick step , the belgian will be a part of it 's nine-man tour de france team .
boonen tested positive for cocaine in an out-of-competition drug test in april .
it was the second positive cocaine test for boonen in a year .
boonen was barred from participating in last year 's tour de france as a result of the first positive test .
initially , tour de france organizers amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- banned boonen from participating in this year 's tour after the second failed drug test , but boonen appealed the decision .
on monday , a french civil court ruled that it not have jurisdiction in the case , and no decision was reached .

boonen has still been riding and competing since the failed drug test .
last weekend , he won the belgian national cycling championships in aywaille , the first senior title of his career in his home country .
in 2005 , he was the world road race champion .
cycling 's governing body , uci , has decided not to take disciplinary action against boonen because the positive test did not occur during a competition period , and cocaine is not a banned substance between races. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.07.2009 lisbon treaty ratification endangered by demands from bavaria 's csu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer , left , and his csu could complicate matters for merkel germany ’ s drive towards ratifying the eu ’ s reforming lisbon treaty may have one more obstacle to overcome after chancellor angela merkel ’ s conservative sister party in bavaria demanded more concessions for berlin . germany 's constitutional court on tuesday ruled that the lisbon treaty was compatible with the country 's constitution , but said some domestic laws needed tweaking before the treaty could be formally ratified .
those laws concerned ensuring the german parliament in berlin had a say in formulating eu decisions made in brussels .
but the christian social union of bavaria -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party to merkel 's cdu , said friday they wanted even greater rights for the bundestag and bundesrat - the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively - enshrined in germany 's constitution .
the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .
" we generally want that the bundestag and the bundesrat must agree -lrb- to eu decisions before they impact germany -rrb- … and we want that parliament has the right to complain if it feels its rights have been affected , " said csu chairman horst seehofer .
the minister of state for europe at the german foreign office , guenter gloser , warned the csu against endangering the treaty 's ratification schedule .
merkel had said the necessary laws would be amended and the treaty passed before the september 27 federal election , but the latest demands from the csu could prolong the ratification process .
the bundestag is to hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified .
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .

the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk is accused of being an accessory to murder in 29,000 cases at the sobibor camp .
the retired auto worker denies having played a role in the holocaust , but german prosecutors have an ss identity card with a photograph of a young man said to be demjanjuk as well as written transcripts of witness testimony that place him at the camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 .
he was deported to germany after losing a court battle to stay in ohio , where he held us citizenship , and has been held in a jail near munich since may 12 . demjanjuk has been stripped of his us citizenship for lying about his past ; he is now stateless .
his case is to be transferred to the court this month , margarethe noetzel , a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor 's office said .
it was not immediately clear when the trial would start .
it could be germany 's last major nazi court case. db / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pechstein is germany 's most successful winter olympian , having won nine medals overall - five of them gold – between 1992 and 2006 .
she is also a six-time world champion and has 25 minor medals from the worlds .
the isu said its decision was " based on the evidence of ms pechstein 's -lrb- sample -rrb- which included abnormal values and abnormal changes of values in a series of tests -lrb- in particular in the tests conducted during the essent isu world allround championships held in hamar on february 7-8 , 2009 -rrb- . "
pechstein was banned from february 9 , 2009 , until february 8 , 2011 , after the completion of a hearing on monday and tuesday .
as a result , she will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver , and , given her age , may end her career .
the isu said pechstein has chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport .
pechstein 's last title was the european all-round crown which she won in january in heerenveen , the netherlands .
she did not medal at the worlds in hamar , withdrawing after two of four events due to a fever. dfm / dpa / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .

indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .

“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”

she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

boonen had previously been banned by tour organizers for failing an out-of-competition cocaine test . the french court 's decision comes one day before the start of the 2009 tour de france in monaco .
according to boonen 's team quick step , the belgian will be a part of it 's nine-man tour de france team .
boonen tested positive for cocaine in an out-of-competition drug test in april .
it was the second positive cocaine test for boonen in a year .
boonen was barred from participating in last year 's tour de france as a result of the first positive test .
initially , tour de france organizers amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- banned boonen from participating in this year 's tour after the second failed drug test , but boonen appealed the decision .
on monday , a french civil court ruled that it not have jurisdiction in the case , and no decision was reached .
boonen 's lawyers then took the appeal before the french olympic committee 's arbitration panel , which issued its decision on friday .
boonen has still been riding and competing since the failed drug test .
last weekend , he won the belgian national cycling championships in aywaille , the first senior title of his career in his home country .
in 2005 , he was the world road race champion .
cycling 's governing body , uci , has decided not to take disciplinary action against boonen because the positive test did not occur during a competition period , and cocaine is not a banned substance between races. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .
even so , tobias kahler , director of one germany , says there is still time to turn things around .
“ the goals set were ambitious , ” he said “ but not unrealistic . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanty towns like this one in south africa could benefit from development aid testimony to that is the fact that two – canada and japan – of the seven countries in on the joint plan to tackle poverty , have already surpassed their , albeit modest , commitments .
“ some countries are keeping their promises , ” kahler said .
“ but there are others that will not . ”
that finger points to france and italy , who are lagging so far behind that they are threatening the credibility of the whole group .
a question of political will italy , which currently holds the g-8 presidency , has failed to make good on its ambitious gleneagles pledge to sub-saharan africa , and has instead announced such deep incisions to its development budget , that critics say it is not worthy of the job of summit host .
indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .
“ it is important for us to reiterate our gleneagles commitments at the summit in italy .
it is central to our credibility , crucial for the nurture of our partnership with africa and an investment in the future .
setting priorities german chancellor angela merkel went some way to outlining that future in a pre-summit speech this week .
she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

demjanjuk is accused of being an accessory to murder in 29,000 cases at the sobibor camp .
the retired auto worker denies having played a role in the holocaust , but german prosecutors have an ss identity card with a photograph of a young man said to be demjanjuk as well as written transcripts of witness testimony that place him at the camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 .
he was deported to germany after losing a court battle to stay in ohio , where he held us citizenship , and has been held in a jail near munich since may 12 . demjanjuk has been stripped of his us citizenship for lying about his past ; he is now stateless .
his case is to be transferred to the court this month , margarethe noetzel , a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor 's office said .
it was not immediately clear when the trial would start .

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .

" neither the worries nor miseries of affected employees are solved with this plan , nor can taxpayers really be assured , " said uwe foullong , a member of the ver.di board of directors .

together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .
even so , tobias kahler , director of one germany , says there is still time to turn things around .
“ the goals set were ambitious , ” he said “ but not unrealistic . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanty towns like this one in south africa could benefit from development aid testimony to that is the fact that two – canada and japan – of the seven countries in on the joint plan to tackle poverty , have already surpassed their , albeit modest , commitments .
“ some countries are keeping their promises , ” kahler said .
“ but there are others that will not . ”
that finger points to france and italy , who are lagging so far behind that they are threatening the credibility of the whole group .
a question of political will italy , which currently holds the g-8 presidency , has failed to make good on its ambitious gleneagles pledge to sub-saharan africa , and has instead announced such deep incisions to its development budget , that critics say it is not worthy of the job of summit host .
indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .
“ it is important for us to reiterate our gleneagles commitments at the summit in italy .
it is central to our credibility , crucial for the nurture of our partnership with africa and an investment in the future .
setting priorities german chancellor angela merkel went some way to outlining that future in a pre-summit speech this week .
she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g-8 summit in italy copenhagen climate deal hangs on g-8 action , expert says nobel laureate stiglitz fears we 'll be worse off after crisis than before g-8 leaders agree to climate change goal overview of the 35th g-8 summit foreign aid -pipe- 03.07.2009 more words than action in g-8 development pledge to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa needs sustained help from abroad to break out of the poverty trap when the group of eight meet in italy , they will turn their eyes towards the african continent to discuss how to fulfil a long-standing commitment to help the world 's poorest countries . around this time five years ago , representatives of the group of eight nations meeting in scotland agreed it was time to make a serious collective commitment towards improving the lot of the world 's poorer countries .
together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .
even so , tobias kahler , director of one germany , says there is still time to turn things around .
“ the goals set were ambitious , ” he said “ but not unrealistic . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanty towns like this one in south africa could benefit from development aid testimony to that is the fact that two – canada and japan – of the seven countries in on the joint plan to tackle poverty , have already surpassed their , albeit modest , commitments .
“ some countries are keeping their promises , ” kahler said .
“ but there are others that will not . ”
that finger points to france and italy , who are lagging so far behind that they are threatening the credibility of the whole group .
a question of political will italy , which currently holds the g-8 presidency , has failed to make good on its ambitious gleneagles pledge to sub-saharan africa , and has instead announced such deep incisions to its development budget , that critics say it is not worthy of the job of summit host .
indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .
“ it is important for us to reiterate our gleneagles commitments at the summit in italy .
it is central to our credibility , crucial for the nurture of our partnership with africa and an investment in the future .
setting priorities german chancellor angela merkel went some way to outlining that future in a pre-summit speech this week .
she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

demjanjuk is accused of being an accessory to murder in 29,000 cases at the sobibor camp .
the retired auto worker denies having played a role in the holocaust , but german prosecutors have an ss identity card with a photograph of a young man said to be demjanjuk as well as written transcripts of witness testimony that place him at the camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 .
he was deported to germany after losing a court battle to stay in ohio , where he held us citizenship , and has been held in a jail near munich since may 12 . demjanjuk has been stripped of his us citizenship for lying about his past ; he is now stateless .
his case is to be transferred to the court this month , margarethe noetzel , a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor 's office said .
it was not immediately clear when the trial would start .

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .
he also said the german taxpayer was most at risk from any savings bank losses because those institutions were backed by government guarantees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g-8 summit in italy copenhagen climate deal hangs on g-8 action , expert says nobel laureate stiglitz fears we 'll be worse off after crisis than before g-8 leaders agree to climate change goal overview of the 35th g-8 summit foreign aid -pipe- 03.07.2009 more words than action in g-8 development pledge to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa needs sustained help from abroad to break out of the poverty trap when the group of eight meet in italy , they will turn their eyes towards the african continent to discuss how to fulfil a long-standing commitment to help the world 's poorest countries . around this time five years ago , representatives of the group of eight nations meeting in scotland agreed it was time to make a serious collective commitment towards improving the lot of the world 's poorer countries .
together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .
even so , tobias kahler , director of one germany , says there is still time to turn things around .
“ the goals set were ambitious , ” he said “ but not unrealistic . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanty towns like this one in south africa could benefit from development aid testimony to that is the fact that two – canada and japan – of the seven countries in on the joint plan to tackle poverty , have already surpassed their , albeit modest , commitments .
“ some countries are keeping their promises , ” kahler said .
“ but there are others that will not . ”
that finger points to france and italy , who are lagging so far behind that they are threatening the credibility of the whole group .
a question of political will italy , which currently holds the g-8 presidency , has failed to make good on its ambitious gleneagles pledge to sub-saharan africa , and has instead announced such deep incisions to its development budget , that critics say it is not worthy of the job of summit host .
indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .
“ it is important for us to reiterate our gleneagles commitments at the summit in italy .
it is central to our credibility , crucial for the nurture of our partnership with africa and an investment in the future .
setting priorities german chancellor angela merkel went some way to outlining that future in a pre-summit speech this week .
she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

boonen had previously been banned by tour organizers for failing an out-of-competition cocaine test . the french court 's decision comes one day before the start of the 2009 tour de france in monaco .
according to boonen 's team quick step , the belgian will be a part of it 's nine-man tour de france team .
boonen tested positive for cocaine in an out-of-competition drug test in april .
it was the second positive cocaine test for boonen in a year .
boonen was barred from participating in last year 's tour de france as a result of the first positive test .
initially , tour de france organizers amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- banned boonen from participating in this year 's tour after the second failed drug test , but boonen appealed the decision .
on monday , a french civil court ruled that it not have jurisdiction in the case , and no decision was reached .
boonen 's lawyers then took the appeal before the french olympic committee 's arbitration panel , which issued its decision on friday .
boonen has still been riding and competing since the failed drug test .
last weekend , he won the belgian national cycling championships in aywaille , the first senior title of his career in his home country .
in 2005 , he was the world road race champion .
cycling 's governing body , uci , has decided not to take disciplinary action against boonen because the positive test did not occur during a competition period , and cocaine is not a banned substance between races. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 03.07.2009 german parliament approves " bad bank " plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is hoped the bad banks will unfreeze credit markets germany ’ s lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has passed a bill for the creation of " bad banks " to absorb toxic assets and clean up balance sheets at financial institutions caught up in the financial crisis . the bill is essentially aimed at unfreezing credit markets and freeing commercial and state-owned banks of their risky and non-core assets .
this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .
he also said the german taxpayer was most at risk from any savings bank losses because those institutions were backed by government guarantees .
bankers divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayernlb was among the many state-owned banks caught out by the crisis manfred weber , general manager of the federation of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- , agreed , saying the current bad banks model offered a reasonable balance between offloading banks ' toxic assets and not simply pushing the debt burden onto taxpayers .
the bdb is an association of private financial institutions .
the federal association of german public sector banks , which has among its members the landesbanken , said the new law would be necessary for battling the credit crunch .
german trade union ver.di stuck to its mandate , insisting the bad banks plan would not guarantee jobs .
" neither the worries nor miseries of affected employees are solved with this plan , nor can taxpayers really be assured , " said uwe foullong , a member of the ver.di board of directors .
the bill was passed by chancellor angela merkel 's large parliamentary coalition and is expected to gain quick approval next week from the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
tax haven bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has intensified the fight against tax cheats earlier friday , the bundestag lower chamber passed another bill which will see increases in taxation scrutiny of companies and private individuals who have business ties to tax havens .
the bill , drafted by steinbrueck but later watered down by the governing parties , targets nations which do not meet minimum standards set by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in his speech , steinbrueck welcomed commitments from 84 nations to meet the oecd standards .
high-income germans will also have to offer more information in tax returns about where they are keeping their assets .
germans are legally required to declare their worldwide income , including yields on financial assets they control abroad .
affluent germans have historically opposed a tightening of tax laws , arguing that tax scrutiny breaches their privacy. dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .
even so , tobias kahler , director of one germany , says there is still time to turn things around .
“ the goals set were ambitious , ” he said “ but not unrealistic . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanty towns like this one in south africa could benefit from development aid testimony to that is the fact that two – canada and japan – of the seven countries in on the joint plan to tackle poverty , have already surpassed their , albeit modest , commitments .
“ some countries are keeping their promises , ” kahler said .
“ but there are others that will not . ”
that finger points to france and italy , who are lagging so far behind that they are threatening the credibility of the whole group .
a question of political will italy , which currently holds the g-8 presidency , has failed to make good on its ambitious gleneagles pledge to sub-saharan africa , and has instead announced such deep incisions to its development budget , that critics say it is not worthy of the job of summit host .
indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .
“ it is important for us to reiterate our gleneagles commitments at the summit in italy .
it is central to our credibility , crucial for the nurture of our partnership with africa and an investment in the future .
setting priorities german chancellor angela merkel went some way to outlining that future in a pre-summit speech this week .
she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

boonen had previously been banned by tour organizers for failing an out-of-competition cocaine test . the french court 's decision comes one day before the start of the 2009 tour de france in monaco .
according to boonen 's team quick step , the belgian will be a part of it 's nine-man tour de france team .
boonen tested positive for cocaine in an out-of-competition drug test in april .
it was the second positive cocaine test for boonen in a year .
boonen was barred from participating in last year 's tour de france as a result of the first positive test .
initially , tour de france organizers amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- banned boonen from participating in this year 's tour after the second failed drug test , but boonen appealed the decision .
on monday , a french civil court ruled that it not have jurisdiction in the case , and no decision was reached .
boonen 's lawyers then took the appeal before the french olympic committee 's arbitration panel , which issued its decision on friday .
boonen has still been riding and competing since the failed drug test .
last weekend , he won the belgian national cycling championships in aywaille , the first senior title of his career in his home country .
in 2005 , he was the world road race champion .
cycling 's governing body , uci , has decided not to take disciplinary action against boonen because the positive test did not occur during a competition period , and cocaine is not a banned substance between races. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 dw-tv europe live global 3000 - the globalization program we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

those laws concerned ensuring the german parliament in berlin had a say in formulating eu decisions made in brussels .
but the christian social union of bavaria -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party to merkel 's cdu , said friday they wanted even greater rights for the bundestag and bundesrat - the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively - enshrined in germany 's constitution .
the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .
" we generally want that the bundestag and the bundesrat must agree -lrb- to eu decisions before they impact germany -rrb- … and we want that parliament has the right to complain if it feels its rights have been affected , " said csu chairman horst seehofer .
the minister of state for europe at the german foreign office , guenter gloser , warned the csu against endangering the treaty 's ratification schedule .
merkel had said the necessary laws would be amended and the treaty passed before the september 27 federal election , but the latest demands from the csu could prolong the ratification process .
the bundestag is to hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified .
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .

boonen had previously been banned by tour organizers for failing an out-of-competition cocaine test . the french court 's decision comes one day before the start of the 2009 tour de france in monaco .
according to boonen 's team quick step , the belgian will be a part of it 's nine-man tour de france team .
boonen tested positive for cocaine in an out-of-competition drug test in april .
it was the second positive cocaine test for boonen in a year .
boonen was barred from participating in last year 's tour de france as a result of the first positive test .
initially , tour de france organizers amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- banned boonen from participating in this year 's tour after the second failed drug test , but boonen appealed the decision .
on monday , a french civil court ruled that it not have jurisdiction in the case , and no decision was reached .
boonen 's lawyers then took the appeal before the french olympic committee 's arbitration panel , which issued its decision on friday .
boonen has still been riding and competing since the failed drug test .
last weekend , he won the belgian national cycling championships in aywaille , the first senior title of his career in his home country .
in 2005 , he was the world road race champion .
cycling 's governing body , uci , has decided not to take disciplinary action against boonen because the positive test did not occur during a competition period , and cocaine is not a banned substance between races. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .
he also said the german taxpayer was most at risk from any savings bank losses because those institutions were backed by government guarantees .
bankers divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayernlb was among the many state-owned banks caught out by the crisis manfred weber , general manager of the federation of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- , agreed , saying the current bad banks model offered a reasonable balance between offloading banks ' toxic assets and not simply pushing the debt burden onto taxpayers .
the bdb is an association of private financial institutions .
the federal association of german public sector banks , which has among its members the landesbanken , said the new law would be necessary for battling the credit crunch .
german trade union ver.di stuck to its mandate , insisting the bad banks plan would not guarantee jobs .
" neither the worries nor miseries of affected employees are solved with this plan , nor can taxpayers really be assured , " said uwe foullong , a member of the ver.di board of directors .
the bill was passed by chancellor angela merkel 's large parliamentary coalition and is expected to gain quick approval next week from the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
tax haven bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has intensified the fight against tax cheats earlier friday , the bundestag lower chamber passed another bill which will see increases in taxation scrutiny of companies and private individuals who have business ties to tax havens .
the bill , drafted by steinbrueck but later watered down by the governing parties , targets nations which do not meet minimum standards set by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in his speech , steinbrueck welcomed commitments from 84 nations to meet the oecd standards .
high-income germans will also have to offer more information in tax returns about where they are keeping their assets .
germans are legally required to declare their worldwide income , including yields on financial assets they control abroad .
affluent germans have historically opposed a tightening of tax laws , arguing that tax scrutiny breaches their privacy. dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those laws concerned ensuring the german parliament in berlin had a say in formulating eu decisions made in brussels .
but the christian social union of bavaria -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party to merkel 's cdu , said friday they wanted even greater rights for the bundestag and bundesrat - the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively - enshrined in germany 's constitution .
the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .
" we generally want that the bundestag and the bundesrat must agree -lrb- to eu decisions before they impact germany -rrb- … and we want that parliament has the right to complain if it feels its rights have been affected , " said csu chairman horst seehofer .
the minister of state for europe at the german foreign office , guenter gloser , warned the csu against endangering the treaty 's ratification schedule .
merkel had said the necessary laws would be amended and the treaty passed before the september 27 federal election , but the latest demands from the csu could prolong the ratification process .
the bundestag is to hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified .
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted. dfm / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .
he also said the german taxpayer was most at risk from any savings bank losses because those institutions were backed by government guarantees .
bankers divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayernlb was among the many state-owned banks caught out by the crisis manfred weber , general manager of the federation of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- , agreed , saying the current bad banks model offered a reasonable balance between offloading banks ' toxic assets and not simply pushing the debt burden onto taxpayers .
the bdb is an association of private financial institutions .
the federal association of german public sector banks , which has among its members the landesbanken , said the new law would be necessary for battling the credit crunch .
german trade union ver.di stuck to its mandate , insisting the bad banks plan would not guarantee jobs .
" neither the worries nor miseries of affected employees are solved with this plan , nor can taxpayers really be assured , " said uwe foullong , a member of the ver.di board of directors .
the bill was passed by chancellor angela merkel 's large parliamentary coalition and is expected to gain quick approval next week from the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
tax haven bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has intensified the fight against tax cheats earlier friday , the bundestag lower chamber passed another bill which will see increases in taxation scrutiny of companies and private individuals who have business ties to tax havens .
the bill , drafted by steinbrueck but later watered down by the governing parties , targets nations which do not meet minimum standards set by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in his speech , steinbrueck welcomed commitments from 84 nations to meet the oecd standards .
high-income germans will also have to offer more information in tax returns about where they are keeping their assets .
germans are legally required to declare their worldwide income , including yields on financial assets they control abroad .
affluent germans have historically opposed a tightening of tax laws , arguing that tax scrutiny breaches their privacy. dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is also a six-time world champion and has 25 minor medals from the worlds .
the isu said its decision was " based on the evidence of ms pechstein 's -lrb- sample -rrb- which included abnormal values and abnormal changes of values in a series of tests -lrb- in particular in the tests conducted during the essent isu world allround championships held in hamar on february 7-8 , 2009 -rrb- .

as a result , she will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver , and , given her age , may end her career .
the isu said pechstein has chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport .
pechstein 's last title was the european all-round crown which she won in january in heerenveen , the netherlands .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk is accused of being an accessory to murder in 29,000 cases at the sobibor camp .
the retired auto worker denies having played a role in the holocaust , but german prosecutors have an ss identity card with a photograph of a young man said to be demjanjuk as well as written transcripts of witness testimony that place him at the camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 .
he was deported to germany after losing a court battle to stay in ohio , where he held us citizenship , and has been held in a jail near munich since may 12 . demjanjuk has been stripped of his us citizenship for lying about his past ; he is now stateless .
his case is to be transferred to the court this month , margarethe noetzel , a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor 's office said .
it was not immediately clear when the trial would start .

those laws concerned ensuring the german parliament in berlin had a say in formulating eu decisions made in brussels .
but the christian social union of bavaria -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party to merkel 's cdu , said friday they wanted even greater rights for the bundestag and bundesrat - the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively - enshrined in germany 's constitution .
the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .
" we generally want that the bundestag and the bundesrat must agree -lrb- to eu decisions before they impact germany -rrb- … and we want that parliament has the right to complain if it feels its rights have been affected , " said csu chairman horst seehofer .
the minister of state for europe at the german foreign office , guenter gloser , warned the csu against endangering the treaty 's ratification schedule .
merkel had said the necessary laws would be amended and the treaty passed before the september 27 federal election , but the latest demands from the csu could prolong the ratification process .
the bundestag is to hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified .
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted. dfm / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pechstein was banned from february 9 , 2009 , until february 8 , 2011 , after the completion of a hearing on monday and tuesday .
as a result , she will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver , and , given her age , may end her career .
the isu said pechstein has chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport .
pechstein 's last title was the european all-round crown which she won in january in heerenveen , the netherlands .

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .
he also said the german taxpayer was most at risk from any savings bank losses because those institutions were backed by government guarantees .
bankers divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayernlb was among the many state-owned banks caught out by the crisis manfred weber , general manager of the federation of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- , agreed , saying the current bad banks model offered a reasonable balance between offloading banks ' toxic assets and not simply pushing the debt burden onto taxpayers .
the bdb is an association of private financial institutions .
the federal association of german public sector banks , which has among its members the landesbanken , said the new law would be necessary for battling the credit crunch .
german trade union ver.di stuck to its mandate , insisting the bad banks plan would not guarantee jobs .
" neither the worries nor miseries of affected employees are solved with this plan , nor can taxpayers really be assured , " said uwe foullong , a member of the ver.di board of directors .
the bill was passed by chancellor angela merkel 's large parliamentary coalition and is expected to gain quick approval next week from the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
tax haven bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has intensified the fight against tax cheats earlier friday , the bundestag lower chamber passed another bill which will see increases in taxation scrutiny of companies and private individuals who have business ties to tax havens .
the bill , drafted by steinbrueck but later watered down by the governing parties , targets nations which do not meet minimum standards set by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in his speech , steinbrueck welcomed commitments from 84 nations to meet the oecd standards .
high-income germans will also have to offer more information in tax returns about where they are keeping their assets .
germans are legally required to declare their worldwide income , including yields on financial assets they control abroad .
affluent germans have historically opposed a tightening of tax laws , arguing that tax scrutiny breaches their privacy. dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk is accused of being an accessory to murder in 29,000 cases at the sobibor camp .

he was deported to germany after losing a court battle to stay in ohio , where he held us citizenship , and has been held in a jail near munich since may 12 . demjanjuk has been stripped of his us citizenship for lying about his past ; he is now stateless .
his case is to be transferred to the court this month , margarethe noetzel , a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor 's office said .

together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .
even so , tobias kahler , director of one germany , says there is still time to turn things around .
“ the goals set were ambitious , ” he said “ but not unrealistic . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanty towns like this one in south africa could benefit from development aid testimony to that is the fact that two – canada and japan – of the seven countries in on the joint plan to tackle poverty , have already surpassed their , albeit modest , commitments .
“ some countries are keeping their promises , ” kahler said .
“ but there are others that will not . ”
that finger points to france and italy , who are lagging so far behind that they are threatening the credibility of the whole group .
a question of political will italy , which currently holds the g-8 presidency , has failed to make good on its ambitious gleneagles pledge to sub-saharan africa , and has instead announced such deep incisions to its development budget , that critics say it is not worthy of the job of summit host .
indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .
“ it is important for us to reiterate our gleneagles commitments at the summit in italy .
it is central to our credibility , crucial for the nurture of our partnership with africa and an investment in the future .
setting priorities german chancellor angela merkel went some way to outlining that future in a pre-summit speech this week .
she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .
he also said the german taxpayer was most at risk from any savings bank losses because those institutions were backed by government guarantees .
bankers divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayernlb was among the many state-owned banks caught out by the crisis manfred weber , general manager of the federation of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- , agreed , saying the current bad banks model offered a reasonable balance between offloading banks ' toxic assets and not simply pushing the debt burden onto taxpayers .
the bdb is an association of private financial institutions .
the federal association of german public sector banks , which has among its members the landesbanken , said the new law would be necessary for battling the credit crunch .
german trade union ver.di stuck to its mandate , insisting the bad banks plan would not guarantee jobs .
" neither the worries nor miseries of affected employees are solved with this plan , nor can taxpayers really be assured , " said uwe foullong , a member of the ver.di board of directors .
the bill was passed by chancellor angela merkel 's large parliamentary coalition and is expected to gain quick approval next week from the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .

the bill , drafted by steinbrueck but later watered down by the governing parties , targets nations which do not meet minimum standards set by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in his speech , steinbrueck welcomed commitments from 84 nations to meet the oecd standards .
high-income germans will also have to offer more information in tax returns about where they are keeping their assets .
germans are legally required to declare their worldwide income , including yields on financial assets they control abroad .

european justice commissioner jacques barrot said that " automatic expulsion rules for entire categories are not acceptable . "
under the new law illegal immigration becomes a criminal offence , punishable with a fine of up to 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,000 -rrb- .

in his speech , steinbrueck welcomed commitments from 84 nations to meet the oecd standards .
high-income germans will also have to offer more information in tax returns about where they are keeping their assets .
germans are legally required to declare their worldwide income , including yields on financial assets they control abroad .
affluent germans have historically opposed a tightening of tax laws , arguing that tax scrutiny breaches their privacy. dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g-8 summit in italy copenhagen climate deal hangs on g-8 action , expert says nobel laureate stiglitz fears we 'll be worse off after crisis than before g-8 leaders agree to climate change goal overview of the 35th g-8 summit foreign aid -pipe- 03.07.2009 more words than action in g-8 development pledge to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa needs sustained help from abroad to break out of the poverty trap when the group of eight meet in italy , they will turn their eyes towards the african continent to discuss how to fulfil a long-standing commitment to help the world 's poorest countries . around this time five years ago , representatives of the group of eight nations meeting in scotland agreed it was time to make a serious collective commitment towards improving the lot of the world 's poorer countries .
together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .
even so , tobias kahler , director of one germany , says there is still time to turn things around .
“ the goals set were ambitious , ” he said “ but not unrealistic . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanty towns like this one in south africa could benefit from development aid testimony to that is the fact that two – canada and japan – of the seven countries in on the joint plan to tackle poverty , have already surpassed their , albeit modest , commitments .
“ some countries are keeping their promises , ” kahler said .
“ but there are others that will not . ”
that finger points to france and italy , who are lagging so far behind that they are threatening the credibility of the whole group .
a question of political will italy , which currently holds the g-8 presidency , has failed to make good on its ambitious gleneagles pledge to sub-saharan africa , and has instead announced such deep incisions to its development budget , that critics say it is not worthy of the job of summit host .
indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .
“ it is important for us to reiterate our gleneagles commitments at the summit in italy .
it is central to our credibility , crucial for the nurture of our partnership with africa and an investment in the future .
setting priorities german chancellor angela merkel went some way to outlining that future in a pre-summit speech this week .
she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

those laws concerned ensuring the german parliament in berlin had a say in formulating eu decisions made in brussels .
but the christian social union of bavaria -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party to merkel 's cdu , said friday they wanted even greater rights for the bundestag and bundesrat - the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively - enshrined in germany 's constitution .
the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .
" we generally want that the bundestag and the bundesrat must agree -lrb- to eu decisions before they impact germany -rrb- … and we want that parliament has the right to complain if it feels its rights have been affected , " said csu chairman horst seehofer .
the minister of state for europe at the german foreign office , guenter gloser , warned the csu against endangering the treaty 's ratification schedule .
merkel had said the necessary laws would be amended and the treaty passed before the september 27 federal election , but the latest demands from the csu could prolong the ratification process .
the bundestag is to hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified .
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .
all eu member states must approve the treaty for it to be formally adopted. dfm / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those laws concerned ensuring the german parliament in berlin had a say in formulating eu decisions made in brussels .
but the christian social union of bavaria -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party to merkel 's cdu , said friday they wanted even greater rights for the bundestag and bundesrat - the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively - enshrined in germany 's constitution .
the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .
" we generally want that the bundestag and the bundesrat must agree -lrb- to eu decisions before they impact germany -rrb- … and we want that parliament has the right to complain if it feels its rights have been affected , " said csu chairman horst seehofer .
the minister of state for europe at the german foreign office , guenter gloser , warned the csu against endangering the treaty 's ratification schedule .
merkel had said the necessary laws would be amended and the treaty passed before the september 27 federal election , but the latest demands from the csu could prolong the ratification process .
the bundestag is to hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified .
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .
the lisbon treaty is a watered-down version of the eu constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
it aims to give the 27-nation bloc stronger leadership , a more effective foreign policy and a fairer decision-making system .

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .

" neither the worries nor miseries of affected employees are solved with this plan , nor can taxpayers really be assured , " said uwe foullong , a member of the ver.di board of directors .

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .

demjanjuk is accused of being an accessory to murder in 29,000 cases at the sobibor camp .
the retired auto worker denies having played a role in the holocaust , but german prosecutors have an ss identity card with a photograph of a young man said to be demjanjuk as well as written transcripts of witness testimony that place him at the camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 .
he was deported to germany after losing a court battle to stay in ohio , where he held us citizenship , and has been held in a jail near munich since may 12 . demjanjuk has been stripped of his us citizenship for lying about his past ; he is now stateless .
his case is to be transferred to the court this month , margarethe noetzel , a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor 's office said .
it was not immediately clear when the trial would start .
it could be germany 's last major nazi court case. db / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 03.07.2009 german parliament approves " bad bank " plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is hoped the bad banks will unfreeze credit markets germany ’ s lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has passed a bill for the creation of " bad banks " to absorb toxic assets and clean up balance sheets at financial institutions caught up in the financial crisis . the bill is essentially aimed at unfreezing credit markets and freeing commercial and state-owned banks of their risky and non-core assets .
this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .
he also said the german taxpayer was most at risk from any savings bank losses because those institutions were backed by government guarantees .
bankers divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayernlb was among the many state-owned banks caught out by the crisis manfred weber , general manager of the federation of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- , agreed , saying the current bad banks model offered a reasonable balance between offloading banks ' toxic assets and not simply pushing the debt burden onto taxpayers .
the bdb is an association of private financial institutions .

the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .

pechstein was banned from february 9 , 2009 , until february 8 , 2011 , after the completion of a hearing on monday and tuesday .
as a result , she will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver , and , given her age , may end her career .
the isu said pechstein has chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport .
pechstein 's last title was the european all-round crown which she won in january in heerenveen , the netherlands .

but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .

indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .

“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .

she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

those laws concerned ensuring the german parliament in berlin had a say in formulating eu decisions made in brussels .
but the christian social union of bavaria -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party to merkel 's cdu , said friday they wanted even greater rights for the bundestag and bundesrat - the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively - enshrined in germany 's constitution .
the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .
" we generally want that the bundestag and the bundesrat must agree -lrb- to eu decisions before they impact germany -rrb- … and we want that parliament has the right to complain if it feels its rights have been affected , " said csu chairman horst seehofer .
the minister of state for europe at the german foreign office , guenter gloser , warned the csu against endangering the treaty 's ratification schedule .
merkel had said the necessary laws would be amended and the treaty passed before the september 27 federal election , but the latest demands from the csu could prolong the ratification process .
the bundestag is to hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified .

boonen had previously been banned by tour organizers for failing an out-of-competition cocaine test . the french court 's decision comes one day before the start of the 2009 tour de france in monaco .
according to boonen 's team quick step , the belgian will be a part of it 's nine-man tour de france team .
boonen tested positive for cocaine in an out-of-competition drug test in april .
it was the second positive cocaine test for boonen in a year .
boonen was barred from participating in last year 's tour de france as a result of the first positive test .
initially , tour de france organizers amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- banned boonen from participating in this year 's tour after the second failed drug test , but boonen appealed the decision .
on monday , a french civil court ruled that it not have jurisdiction in the case , and no decision was reached .
boonen 's lawyers then took the appeal before the french olympic committee 's arbitration panel , which issued its decision on friday .
boonen has still been riding and competing since the failed drug test .
last weekend , he won the belgian national cycling championships in aywaille , the first senior title of his career in his home country .
in 2005 , he was the world road race champion .
cycling 's governing body , uci , has decided not to take disciplinary action against boonen because the positive test did not occur during a competition period , and cocaine is not a banned substance between races. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pechstein is germany 's most successful winter olympian , having won nine medals overall - five of them gold – between 1992 and 2006 .
she is also a six-time world champion and has 25 minor medals from the worlds .
the isu said its decision was " based on the evidence of ms pechstein 's -lrb- sample -rrb- which included abnormal values and abnormal changes of values in a series of tests -lrb- in particular in the tests conducted during the essent isu world allround championships held in hamar on february 7-8 , 2009 -rrb- . "
pechstein was banned from february 9 , 2009 , until february 8 , 2011 , after the completion of a hearing on monday and tuesday .
as a result , she will miss the 2010 winter olympics in vancouver , and , given her age , may end her career .
the isu said pechstein has chosen to appeal against the ban before the court of arbitration for sport .
pechstein 's last title was the european all-round crown which she won in january in heerenveen , the netherlands .
she did not medal at the worlds in hamar , withdrawing after two of four events due to a fever. dfm / dpa / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g-8 summit in italy copenhagen climate deal hangs on g-8 action , expert says nobel laureate stiglitz fears we 'll be worse off after crisis than before g-8 leaders agree to climate change goal overview of the 35th g-8 summit foreign aid -pipe- 03.07.2009 more words than action in g-8 development pledge to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa needs sustained help from abroad to break out of the poverty trap when the group of eight meet in italy , they will turn their eyes towards the african continent to discuss how to fulfil a long-standing commitment to help the world 's poorest countries . around this time five years ago , representatives of the group of eight nations meeting in scotland agreed it was time to make a serious collective commitment towards improving the lot of the world 's poorer countries .
together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .
even so , tobias kahler , director of one germany , says there is still time to turn things around .
“ the goals set were ambitious , ” he said “ but not unrealistic . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanty towns like this one in south africa could benefit from development aid testimony to that is the fact that two – canada and japan – of the seven countries in on the joint plan to tackle poverty , have already surpassed their , albeit modest , commitments .
“ some countries are keeping their promises , ” kahler said .
“ but there are others that will not . ”
that finger points to france and italy , who are lagging so far behind that they are threatening the credibility of the whole group .
a question of political will italy , which currently holds the g-8 presidency , has failed to make good on its ambitious gleneagles pledge to sub-saharan africa , and has instead announced such deep incisions to its development budget , that critics say it is not worthy of the job of summit host .
indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .
“ it is important for us to reiterate our gleneagles commitments at the summit in italy .
it is central to our credibility , crucial for the nurture of our partnership with africa and an investment in the future .
setting priorities german chancellor angela merkel went some way to outlining that future in a pre-summit speech this week .

together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .
even so , tobias kahler , director of one germany , says there is still time to turn things around .
“ the goals set were ambitious , ” he said “ but not unrealistic . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanty towns like this one in south africa could benefit from development aid testimony to that is the fact that two – canada and japan – of the seven countries in on the joint plan to tackle poverty , have already surpassed their , albeit modest , commitments .
“ some countries are keeping their promises , ” kahler said .
“ but there are others that will not . ”
that finger points to france and italy , who are lagging so far behind that they are threatening the credibility of the whole group .
a question of political will italy , which currently holds the g-8 presidency , has failed to make good on its ambitious gleneagles pledge to sub-saharan africa , and has instead announced such deep incisions to its development budget , that critics say it is not worthy of the job of summit host .
indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .

those laws concerned ensuring the german parliament in berlin had a say in formulating eu decisions made in brussels .
but the christian social union of bavaria -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party to merkel 's cdu , said friday they wanted even greater rights for the bundestag and bundesrat - the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively - enshrined in germany 's constitution .
the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .
" we generally want that the bundestag and the bundesrat must agree -lrb- to eu decisions before they impact germany -rrb- … and we want that parliament has the right to complain if it feels its rights have been affected , " said csu chairman horst seehofer .
the minister of state for europe at the german foreign office , guenter gloser , warned the csu against endangering the treaty 's ratification schedule .
merkel had said the necessary laws would be amended and the treaty passed before the september 27 federal election , but the latest demands from the csu could prolong the ratification process .
the bundestag is to hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified .
eu-wide ratification still awaits a second referendum on the treaty in ireland , as well as approval by the eurosceptic presidents of the czech republic and poland , which are awaiting the outcome of the irish vote .

those laws concerned ensuring the german parliament in berlin had a say in formulating eu decisions made in brussels .
but the christian social union of bavaria -lrb- csu -rrb- , sister party to merkel 's cdu , said friday they wanted even greater rights for the bundestag and bundesrat - the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively - enshrined in germany 's constitution .
the party also called for parliament to be enabled to take part in government decisions on eu matters , and wants the constitutional court to have the final word on interpreting the lisbon treaty .
" we generally want that the bundestag and the bundesrat must agree -lrb- to eu decisions before they impact germany -rrb- … and we want that parliament has the right to complain if it feels its rights have been affected , " said csu chairman horst seehofer .
the minister of state for europe at the german foreign office , guenter gloser , warned the csu against endangering the treaty 's ratification schedule .
merkel had said the necessary laws would be amended and the treaty passed before the september 27 federal election , but the latest demands from the csu could prolong the ratification process .
the bundestag is to hold special sessions on august 26 and september 8 to debate the legislation allowing the treaty to be ratified .

boonen had previously been banned by tour organizers for failing an out-of-competition cocaine test . the french court 's decision comes one day before the start of the 2009 tour de france in monaco .
according to boonen 's team quick step , the belgian will be a part of it 's nine-man tour de france team .
boonen tested positive for cocaine in an out-of-competition drug test in april .
it was the second positive cocaine test for boonen in a year .
boonen was barred from participating in last year 's tour de france as a result of the first positive test .
initially , tour de france organizers amaury sports organization -lrb- aso -rrb- banned boonen from participating in this year 's tour after the second failed drug test , but boonen appealed the decision .
on monday , a french civil court ruled that it not have jurisdiction in the case , and no decision was reached .
boonen 's lawyers then took the appeal before the french olympic committee 's arbitration panel , which issued its decision on friday .
boonen has still been riding and competing since the failed drug test .
last weekend , he won the belgian national cycling championships in aywaille , the first senior title of his career in his home country .
in 2005 , he was the world road race champion .
cycling 's governing body , uci , has decided not to take disciplinary action against boonen because the positive test did not occur during a competition period , and cocaine is not a banned substance between races. mz / afp / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 03.07.2009 bar owner guilty of promoting binge-drinking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard liquor is bad news for binge drinkers a german court in berlin has sentenced a bar owner to three years and five months in jail for giving a 16-year-old teenager so much alcohol that he later fell into a coma and died . the incident received extensive coverage in the german press and triggered a nationwide debate about the growing problem of alcoholism among young people .
the bout of binge drinking began as a contest between the owner of the bar and the 16-year-old high school student in february 2007 .
over a period of just a few hours , the barkeeper served the young man 45 shots of tequila , while drinking mostly water himself . the teenager became so inebriated that he collapsed into a coma .
he was rushed to a hospital where doctors found he had 4.4 parts per thousand of alcohol in his blood .
in germany , 0.8 parts per thousand is considered the level at which you are too drunk to drive .
the young man never recovered and died five weeks later .
the 28-year-old owner of the bar was charged with aggravated assault resulting in death at the time in what became known as the " tequila trial " .
the verdict announced on friday was slightly less than what prosecutors had asked for during the trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap alcohol makes it easy to get started alarming statistics young people in germany today are confronted with alcohol and its consumption every day .
a popular pastime among teenagers is so-called flat-rate parties , where you pay one price for all you can drink .
interviewed for this report , one young woman said that when she can drink what she wants , she " automatically drinks more . "
" then you drink the hard stuff .
i always drink the hard stuff , " she said .
sabine baetzing , the german government 's commissioner for drug and alcohol abuse , has sounded the alarm bells over teenage drinking .
" what is increasing among young people is excessive drinking – so-called binge drinking , " she said .
" one-in-five teenagers claim to be drunk at least once a month , and last year there were 24,000 children and teenagers who had drunk themselves into a coma and had to be hospitalized with alcohol poisoning .
so , we have a problem with this excessive drinking . "
the statistics baetzing provides are indeed alarming : 75 percent of 12 to 17-year-olds consumed a minimum of five glasses of alcohol at least once last year ; 20 percent did this at least once a month ; and 6 percent were binge drinkers once a week .
compared to the year 2000 , these figures represent an increase of 143 percent .
bildunterschrift : party-time for young people laws not observed but even so , baetzing said it 's not the laws that need to be changed – people just have to respect them .
" in germany , the law is that a person must be 16 to drink , beer , wine and champagne and 18 to consume brandy and schnapps , " baetzing said .
" we have two age limits , which we intend to keep .
we are concerned about a moderate and responsible handling of alcohol .
what we need is for these laws to be observed , " she said .
one of the main problems for young people , according to baetzing , is that their adult role models commonly abuse alcohol , drugs and tobacco .
a full 17 million germans smoke , nearly 10 million consume enough alcohol for it to be a health risk and 1.3 million are alcoholics .
too many young people , in baetzing 's view , start down this same path with too much , too early. gb / dpa / ap / glp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : g-8 summit in italy copenhagen climate deal hangs on g-8 action , expert says nobel laureate stiglitz fears we 'll be worse off after crisis than before g-8 leaders agree to climate change goal overview of the 35th g-8 summit foreign aid -pipe- 03.07.2009 more words than action in g-8 development pledge to africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa needs sustained help from abroad to break out of the poverty trap when the group of eight meet in italy , they will turn their eyes towards the african continent to discuss how to fulfil a long-standing commitment to help the world 's poorest countries . around this time five years ago , representatives of the group of eight nations meeting in scotland agreed it was time to make a serious collective commitment towards improving the lot of the world 's poorer countries .
together – with the exception of russia – the heads of state pledged to increase their aid budget by $ 50 billion -lrb- € 35 billion -rrb- by 2010 , and earmarked half of the sum for african countries .
but as the deadline races ever closer , there is growing concern over the earnestness of those declarations of benevolence .
a recent report published by the anti-poverty campaign organization , one , found that just one third of the promised increase had been delivered by the end of 2008 .
even so , tobias kahler , director of one germany , says there is still time to turn things around .
“ the goals set were ambitious , ” he said “ but not unrealistic . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shanty towns like this one in south africa could benefit from development aid testimony to that is the fact that two – canada and japan – of the seven countries in on the joint plan to tackle poverty , have already surpassed their , albeit modest , commitments .
“ some countries are keeping their promises , ” kahler said .
“ but there are others that will not . ”
that finger points to france and italy , who are lagging so far behind that they are threatening the credibility of the whole group .
a question of political will italy , which currently holds the g-8 presidency , has failed to make good on its ambitious gleneagles pledge to sub-saharan africa , and has instead announced such deep incisions to its development budget , that critics say it is not worthy of the job of summit host .
indeed , rome and paris and to a lesser extent the u.s. , britain and germany do have some catching up to do , but head of venro , the association of german development non-governmental organizations , heike spielmans , agrees that they can still pull it off if they adopt the right attitude .
“ it 's a matter of political will , ” spielmans said .
“ we 're told there is n't enough money to invest in development aid , but look how much can be mobilized to deal with the economic crisis . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : granting an education to african children is a high priority .
she says it is extremely frustrating for aid workers faced with the daily realities of the sick , the starving and the uneducated , to have to watch protectionist governments losing sight of their global responsibilities .
“ the economic crisis has brought about a shift in priorities .
it means countries are investing more in their domestic problems , ” she said , adding that in actual fact it is the poor who have suffered most from the world 's financial woes .
“ they have no social security to fall back on , so when investors pull out , they leave people in poverty . ”
working together spielmans is adamant that this is not the time for the world 's strongest countries , countries such as those who form g-8 , to abandon their less fortunate cousins .
“ the very least we can expect , is that they keep their promise . ”
yet ulrike metzger of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development says berlin recognizes that this is the time for building upon , not dismantling relations with african countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl searches for food in zimbabwe “ africa has made great economic and political progress since 2000 , and that momentum should not be broken , ” she said , adding that it was up to the g-8 nations to send a signal to developing nations that they are reliable partners .
“ it is important for us to reiterate our gleneagles commitments at the summit in italy .
it is central to our credibility , crucial for the nurture of our partnership with africa and an investment in the future .
setting priorities german chancellor angela merkel went some way to outlining that future in a pre-summit speech this week .
she said she saw the need for a planned 0.4 percent increase in aid funds both to help steady a continent shaken by the economic crisis and to pave the way for export-reliant germany to reach new markets .
“ if all the capital is pulled out , it is not only the african nations that will suffer , but we will lose export opportunities , ” the chancellor said .
and while everyone agrees that that makes economic sense , heike spielmans says the top priority has to be to “ eradicate world hunger and grant everybody the chance to live in dignity . ”
both she and tobias kahler of the one campaign will be watching the summit closely and hoping it will inspire a renewed display of the spirit which unofficially bound the g8 to the gleneagles commitment in the first place .
“ it 's time for them to stop moving at the pace of a tortoise and to come up with a rescue plan which enables them to meet the 2010 goals on target , ” kahler said .

this will be achieved by shifting as much as 230 billion euros -lrb- $ 322 billion -rrb- worth of toxic assets held by banks to the so-called bad banks .
the plan will involve exchanging items such as asset-backed securities and collateralized-debt obligations for state-guaranteed bonds , for which banks will be charged a fee .
it is hoped the bill can help consolidate germany 's many state-owned banks , the landesbanken , several of which have been hit hard by the effects of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
finance minister peer steinbrueck denied to legislators that the bill effectively meant the taxpayer was picking up the tab for past bank excesses .
he assailed germany 's savings banks , also known as sparkassen , which had criticized the bill .
he also said the german taxpayer was most at risk from any savings bank losses because those institutions were backed by government guarantees .
bankers divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayernlb was among the many state-owned banks caught out by the crisis manfred weber , general manager of the federation of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- , agreed , saying the current bad banks model offered a reasonable balance between offloading banks ' toxic assets and not simply pushing the debt burden onto taxpayers .
the bdb is an association of private financial institutions .
the federal association of german public sector banks , which has among its members the landesbanken , said the new law would be necessary for battling the credit crunch .
german trade union ver.di stuck to its mandate , insisting the bad banks plan would not guarantee jobs .
" neither the worries nor miseries of affected employees are solved with this plan , nor can taxpayers really be assured , " said uwe foullong , a member of the ver.di board of directors .
the bill was passed by chancellor angela merkel 's large parliamentary coalition and is expected to gain quick approval next week from the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
tax haven bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has intensified the fight against tax cheats earlier friday , the bundestag lower chamber passed another bill which will see increases in taxation scrutiny of companies and private individuals who have business ties to tax havens .
the bill , drafted by steinbrueck but later watered down by the governing parties , targets nations which do not meet minimum standards set by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
in his speech , steinbrueck welcomed commitments from 84 nations to meet the oecd standards .
high-income germans will also have to offer more information in tax returns about where they are keeping their assets .
germans are legally required to declare their worldwide income , including yields on financial assets they control abroad .
affluent germans have historically opposed a tightening of tax laws , arguing that tax scrutiny breaches their privacy. dfm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

demjanjuk is accused of being an accessory to murder in 29,000 cases at the sobibor camp .
the retired auto worker denies having played a role in the holocaust , but german prosecutors have an ss identity card with a photograph of a young man said to be demjanjuk as well as written transcripts of witness testimony that place him at the camp in nazi-occupied poland in 1943 .
he was deported to germany after losing a court battle to stay in ohio , where he held us citizenship , and has been held in a jail near munich since may 12 . demjanjuk has been stripped of his us citizenship for lying about his past ; he is now stateless .
his case is to be transferred to the court this month , margarethe noetzel , a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor 's office said .
it was not immediately clear when the trial would start .

advertisement the dinosaur discovery is " a major breakthrough " australian palaeontologists say they have discovered three new dinosaur species after examining fossils dug up in queensland .
writing in the journal plos one , they describe one of the creatures as a fearsome predator with three large slashing claws on each hand .
the other two were herbivores : one a tall giraffe-like creature , the other of stocky build like a hippopotamus .
the fossils date back nearly 100 million years .
they were found in rocks known as the winton formation .
the dinosaurs have names relating to australia 's famous folk ballad waltzing matilda .
the carnivore , which has the scientific classification australovenator wintonensis , has therefore been dubbed " banjo " after andrew barton " banjo " patterson , who composed the song in winton in 1885 .
queensland museum palaeontologist scott hucknell said the creature would have been a terrifying prospect .
" the cheetah of his time , banjo was light and agile .
he could run down most prey with ease over open ground , " he told reporters .

the aquino family , long dominant in philippine politics , said she had been battling cancer for a year and a half .
she has refused further chemotherapy or other medical treatment against colon cancer , her publicist said .
mrs aquino became president when the 1986 people 's power uprising deposed former dictator ferdinand marcos .
the widow of former senator benigno ' ninoy ' aquino , she was catapulted from domesticity to run a country deeply divided after years of martial law and communist insurgency .
she battled several coup attempts against her rule , protected the country 's fledgling democracy and freed political prisoners .
but she was often criticised for weakness before overseeing a smooth transition to president fidel ramos in 1992 .
in recent years , she has campaigned against former president joseph ' erap ' estrada , but then reconciled with him to join protests against incumbent president gloria arroyo over allegations of vote-rigging and corruption .
prayers now 76 years old , mrs aquino was recently hospitalised " because of her loss of appetite , caused by fluid build-up in her stomach area , " her family said .
" we remain in complete trust in god 's infinite healing power , " the family 's statement said .
" our family wishes to thank the filipino people for your prayers and outpouring of love and concern for our mother , " the statement said .
" she has and always will be a woman of faith , a fighter , a source of hope and inspiration for all of us , not just her family but our entire nation as well , " the statement said .
at the start of a series of daily masses to pray for mrs aquino 's health , mr estrada and former first lady imelda marcos offered their prayers .
" i asked all these people to offer prayers to her .
i have peace in my heart and am comfortable with the truth .
i am praying for her safe recovery , " mrs marcos said as she handed out bags of rice at a northern manila slum to celebrate her 80th birthday on thursday .
the murder of mrs aquino 's husband , ninoy , in 1983 , led to widespread street protests that culminated three years later in the marcos regime 's demise .
deedee siytangco , mrs aquino 's publicist , told reporters mrs aquino remained conscious and stable .

the judgement overturns a 149-year-old colonial law which described a same-sex relationship as an " unnatural offence " .
vikram doctor , writer and gay rights activist the ruling is a huge step forward .
it is fantastic .
i hope the government of india accepts the delhi high court decision .
it has been an eight-year battle and i am glad it came through .
in one way it changes nothing - there are many gay couples in india anyway .
in another way , it changes everything .
till now we were considered to be criminals .
if a gay couple wanted to buy a house together , it was not possible .
no financial institute would even consider them .
rights groups have long campaigned for a repeal of the law i am not saying they can do this now but now we can start fighting .
there are gangs who target gays as they would not go to a police station for the fear of being booked themselves .
even some policemen are part of these gangs .
in lucknow there has been an incident where even social activists working with msms -lrb- men having sex with men -rrb- for hiv prevention have been detained by the police .
and these incidents happen everywhere .
nitin karani , gay rights activist for me , most importantly people who are afraid to come forward will be able to do so .
it is very difficult to reach out to hiv-positive people .
also families who use this section to scare their children and get them married forcibly wo n't be able to do so .
this ruling will contribute in making society 's attitude more positive .
cases of police harassment may reduce .
i have seen people driven to suicide .
i hope this decision gives more confidence to gay people to come out , be less afraid .
aditya bandyopadhyay , lawyer and gay rights activist we are elated .
it 's a path-breaking judgement .
it 's a historic judgement , it 's india 's stonewall .
i think what now happens is that a lot of our fundamental rights and civic rights which were denied to us can now be reclaimed by us .
the government has so far been pandering to narrow parochial groups , religious groups but the court order shows that india is ruled by constitutional laws and not by vote-bank politics .
it 's a fabulously written judgement , and it restores our faith in judiciary .
anjali gopalan , naz foundation working on hiv prevention we have finally entered the 21st century .
the government ca n't ignore this .
gautam bhan , gay rights activist this is a long-awaited and incredible judgement .
the judges in their verdict spoke about inclusivity , equality and dignity .
they spoke about a vision of india as an open , tolerant society and to hear all this from the delhi high court was amazing .
scott long , transgender rights program , human rights watch this legal remnant of british colonialism has been used to deprive people of their basic rights for too long .
this long-awaited decision testifies to the reach of democracy and rights in india .
british colonisers introduced section 377 to india in 1860 .
it became a model for similar sodomy laws imposed on other british colonies , and comparable provisions survive today from singapore to uganda .
most of the world 's sodomy laws are relics of colonialism .
as the world 's largest democracy , india has shown the way for other countries to rid themselves of these repressive burdens .
celina jaitley , bollywood actress i 'm overwhelmed .
it 's great not to be criminalised for being a human being and what you do in your bedroom .
wendell rodricks , fashion designer it is a historic moment for all of india .
it has been a long fight .
now , one is not a criminal when anyway one was not in the first place .
it is a move in the right direction and i would go further to say that india is not a religion-run state and this decision is restoring dignity to a community that has been fighting for a long time .
onir basu , filmmaker it is an important decision , a step in the right direction .
when i was making my film my brother nikhil -lrb- a film with a gay couple as protagonists -rrb- , no one was willing to finance us .
no big star was ready to be part of it .
people used to ask why i would want to get slotted .
the ruling is good for prevention of hiv .
whenever something is hidden people do not get to know .
the disease spreads because no one talks about it .

the judgement overturns a 149-year-old colonial law which described a same-sex relationship as an " unnatural offence " .
vikram doctor , writer and gay rights activist the ruling is a huge step forward .
it is fantastic .
i hope the government of india accepts the delhi high court decision .
it has been an eight-year battle and i am glad it came through .
in one way it changes nothing - there are many gay couples in india anyway .
in another way , it changes everything .
till now we were considered to be criminals .
if a gay couple wanted to buy a house together , it was not possible .
no financial institute would even consider them .
rights groups have long campaigned for a repeal of the law i am not saying they can do this now but now we can start fighting .
there are gangs who target gays as they would not go to a police station for the fear of being booked themselves .
even some policemen are part of these gangs .
in lucknow there has been an incident where even social activists working with msms -lrb- men having sex with men -rrb- for hiv prevention have been detained by the police .
and these incidents happen everywhere .
nitin karani , gay rights activist for me , most importantly people who are afraid to come forward will be able to do so .
it is very difficult to reach out to hiv-positive people .
also families who use this section to scare their children and get them married forcibly wo n't be able to do so .
this ruling will contribute in making society 's attitude more positive .
cases of police harassment may reduce .
i have seen people driven to suicide .
i hope this decision gives more confidence to gay people to come out , be less afraid .
aditya bandyopadhyay , lawyer and gay rights activist we are elated .
it 's a path-breaking judgement .
it 's a historic judgement , it 's india 's stonewall .
i think what now happens is that a lot of our fundamental rights and civic rights which were denied to us can now be reclaimed by us .
the government has so far been pandering to narrow parochial groups , religious groups but the court order shows that india is ruled by constitutional laws and not by vote-bank politics .
it 's a fabulously written judgement , and it restores our faith in judiciary .
anjali gopalan , naz foundation working on hiv prevention we have finally entered the 21st century .
the government ca n't ignore this .
gautam bhan , gay rights activist this is a long-awaited and incredible judgement .
the judges in their verdict spoke about inclusivity , equality and dignity .
they spoke about a vision of india as an open , tolerant society and to hear all this from the delhi high court was amazing .
scott long , transgender rights program , human rights watch this legal remnant of british colonialism has been used to deprive people of their basic rights for too long .
this long-awaited decision testifies to the reach of democracy and rights in india .
british colonisers introduced section 377 to india in 1860 .
it became a model for similar sodomy laws imposed on other british colonies , and comparable provisions survive today from singapore to uganda .
most of the world 's sodomy laws are relics of colonialism .
as the world 's largest democracy , india has shown the way for other countries to rid themselves of these repressive burdens .
celina jaitley , bollywood actress i 'm overwhelmed .
it 's great not to be criminalised for being a human being and what you do in your bedroom .
wendell rodricks , fashion designer it is a historic moment for all of india .
it has been a long fight .
now , one is not a criminal when anyway one was not in the first place .
it is a move in the right direction and i would go further to say that india is not a religion-run state and this decision is restoring dignity to a community that has been fighting for a long time .
onir basu , filmmaker it is an important decision , a step in the right direction .
when i was making my film my brother nikhil -lrb- a film with a gay couple as protagonists -rrb- , no one was willing to finance us .
no big star was ready to be part of it .
people used to ask why i would want to get slotted .
the ruling is good for prevention of hiv .
whenever something is hidden people do not get to know .
the disease spreads because no one talks about it .

the judgement overturns a 149-year-old colonial law which described a same-sex relationship as an " unnatural offence " .
vikram doctor , writer and gay rights activist the ruling is a huge step forward .
it is fantastic .
i hope the government of india accepts the delhi high court decision .
it has been an eight-year battle and i am glad it came through .
in one way it changes nothing - there are many gay couples in india anyway .
in another way , it changes everything .
till now we were considered to be criminals .
if a gay couple wanted to buy a house together , it was not possible .
no financial institute would even consider them .
rights groups have long campaigned for a repeal of the law i am not saying they can do this now but now we can start fighting .
there are gangs who target gays as they would not go to a police station for the fear of being booked themselves .
even some policemen are part of these gangs .
in lucknow there has been an incident where even social activists working with msms -lrb- men having sex with men -rrb- for hiv prevention have been detained by the police .
and these incidents happen everywhere .
nitin karani , gay rights activist for me , most importantly people who are afraid to come forward will be able to do so .
it is very difficult to reach out to hiv-positive people .
also families who use this section to scare their children and get them married forcibly wo n't be able to do so .
this ruling will contribute in making society 's attitude more positive .
cases of police harassment may reduce .
i have seen people driven to suicide .
i hope this decision gives more confidence to gay people to come out , be less afraid .
aditya bandyopadhyay , lawyer and gay rights activist we are elated .
it 's a path-breaking judgement .
it 's a historic judgement , it 's india 's stonewall .

the judgement overturns a 149-year-old colonial law which described a same-sex relationship as an " unnatural offence " .
vikram doctor , writer and gay rights activist the ruling is a huge step forward .
it is fantastic .
i hope the government of india accepts the delhi high court decision .
it has been an eight-year battle and i am glad it came through .
in one way it changes nothing - there are many gay couples in india anyway .
in another way , it changes everything .
till now we were considered to be criminals .
if a gay couple wanted to buy a house together , it was not possible .
no financial institute would even consider them .
rights groups have long campaigned for a repeal of the law i am not saying they can do this now but now we can start fighting .
there are gangs who target gays as they would not go to a police station for the fear of being booked themselves .
even some policemen are part of these gangs .
in lucknow there has been an incident where even social activists working with msms -lrb- men having sex with men -rrb- for hiv prevention have been detained by the police .
and these incidents happen everywhere .
nitin karani , gay rights activist for me , most importantly people who are afraid to come forward will be able to do so .
it is very difficult to reach out to hiv-positive people .
also families who use this section to scare their children and get them married forcibly wo n't be able to do so .
this ruling will contribute in making society 's attitude more positive .
cases of police harassment may reduce .
i have seen people driven to suicide .
i hope this decision gives more confidence to gay people to come out , be less afraid .
aditya bandyopadhyay , lawyer and gay rights activist we are elated .
it 's a path-breaking judgement .
it 's a historic judgement , it 's india 's stonewall .
i think what now happens is that a lot of our fundamental rights and civic rights which were denied to us can now be reclaimed by us .
the government has so far been pandering to narrow parochial groups , religious groups but the court order shows that india is ruled by constitutional laws and not by vote-bank politics .
it 's a fabulously written judgement , and it restores our faith in judiciary .
anjali gopalan , naz foundation working on hiv prevention we have finally entered the 21st century .
the government ca n't ignore this .
gautam bhan , gay rights activist this is a long-awaited and incredible judgement .
the judges in their verdict spoke about inclusivity , equality and dignity .
they spoke about a vision of india as an open , tolerant society and to hear all this from the delhi high court was amazing .
scott long , transgender rights program , human rights watch this legal remnant of british colonialism has been used to deprive people of their basic rights for too long .
this long-awaited decision testifies to the reach of democracy and rights in india .
british colonisers introduced section 377 to india in 1860 .
it became a model for similar sodomy laws imposed on other british colonies , and comparable provisions survive today from singapore to uganda .
most of the world 's sodomy laws are relics of colonialism .
as the world 's largest democracy , india has shown the way for other countries to rid themselves of these repressive burdens .
celina jaitley , bollywood actress i 'm overwhelmed .
it 's great not to be criminalised for being a human being and what you do in your bedroom .
wendell rodricks , fashion designer it is a historic moment for all of india .
it has been a long fight .
now , one is not a criminal when anyway one was not in the first place .
it is a move in the right direction and i would go further to say that india is not a religion-run state and this decision is restoring dignity to a community that has been fighting for a long time .
onir basu , filmmaker it is an important decision , a step in the right direction .
when i was making my film my brother nikhil -lrb- a film with a gay couple as protagonists -rrb- , no one was willing to finance us .
no big star was ready to be part of it .
people used to ask why i would want to get slotted .
the ruling is good for prevention of hiv .
whenever something is hidden people do not get to know .
the disease spreads because no one talks about it .

they cite an award-winning teacher who encouraged her class by asking three spanish footballers with swansea city to talk to her pupils in pembrokeshire .
ten years ago 41 % of pupils in wales chose to do a foreign language at gcse .
this had fallen to 28 % two years ago .
education watchdog estyn said secondary schools should promote modern foreign languages to pupils and their parents .
it found the standards of language teaching were much higher than for most subjects , but more could be done .
the inspectorate has called for wales ' secondary sector to provide a minimum of two hours per week at key stage 3 -lrb- the first three years of secondary education -rrb- .
it also wants to see better collaboration between the english , welsh and modern foreign language departments and more use of languages in vocational courses such as tourism , business and engineering .
it highlighted cathy young who last month won wales ' outstanding new teacher award .
mrs young , who teaches french and spanish at pembroke school , was praised by judges for her innovation , which included asking three spanish-speaking footballers from swansea city fc to talk to her gcse pupils .
estyn inspectors sent questionnaires to more than 50 secondary schools and visited 14 .
the report found the standards of achievement were generally good , and in some cases outstanding .
however , the study found the attainment gap between boys and girls was greater than in other subjects , with girls having much better results on average .
cilt cymru , wales ' national centre of expertise on language teaching , said it was essential for language learning to be " slotted in " to vocational courses as an alternative to the academic route .
claire parry , language advisor for 14-19 year-olds , said : " children need context for the language that they are learning .
we need to ensure that language skills are linked to all subjects .
' international economy ' " there will always be a minority , perhaps 20 % , who will go down the academic route .
there may be 80 % for whom a language is not going to be their main subject , but the language element is absolutely important .
" it 's a skill that 's vital for an international economy . "
chief inspector dr bill maxwell said : " although there is some evidence of good practice at work across secondary schools in wales , more needs to be done at all levels to encourage both boys and girls to study a modern foreign language . "
a welsh assembly government spokesperson welcomed estyn 's report .
he said : " the good practice identified by estyn alongside the areas of improvement will inform further work with schools and local authorities to ensure that there are effective arrangements in place for the provision of modern foreign languages . "

advertisement the story told in fatenah is based on a true case by mohammed harmassi bbc arabic a woman from gaza stands at an israeli check-point .
we can only see her back but it is clear that in shame she opens her top to a female israeli soldier to show that her breasts have been removed in an attempt to beat cancer .
despite this , she is refused entry to israel on security grounds .
this is the climactic scene from the first major palestinian attempt at an animated movie and it is based on a true story .
but this is not an anti-israeli rant .
there are good and bad characters on both sides of the israeli-palestinian divide .
the heroine of the movie is called fatenah .
she is a gazan woman whose dream of finding love and leading a normal life is torn apart by cancer and the conflict between the palestinians and the israelis .
" usually palestinians are treated as numbers , but this is not the case here , " said saed andoni , the film 's producer .
" behind each number there is a long story and that is why we focus on this one individual . "
true story the animation tells of fatenah 's fight against cancer ; the removal of both her breasts , palestinian doctors who delayed her diagnosis and israeli soldiers who delayed her treatment .
it also tells of a rare friendship between the gazan and an israeli woman , dafna .
the animation is threaded together by a love story between fatenah and a gazan man .
the depiction of the impoverished coastal strip is condensed into harshly coloured scenes in the 30-minute animation ; an israeli checkpoint , crowded buildings and the sea .
fatenah has large eyes and a small mouth - symbolic of a woman " compelled to a bitter existence but not empowered to speak " , says director ahmad habash .
fatenah 's struggle and friendship with an israeli woman is based on the real-life story of a gazan woman named fatma .
fatenah shows one woman 's lonely battle to get treatment for breast cancer her fight against breast cancer was told by the israeli group " physicians for human rights " in a 2005 report after the disease killed her .
" the report was so unbelievable , that when you read it you feel like it is fiction .
it is absurd .
you can not believe that these things happen even though we as palestinians live in this situation , " says mr andoni .
health care in gaza is poor - a legacy of poor training , corruption and shabby equipment .
a blockade tightened after militant group hamas seized power of gaza in june 2007 has sealed people in , and kept many medical supplies out .
but israel says it continues to allow in humanitarian goods despite the blockade .
seriously ill residents must find treatment in egypt , israel , or cross from there to the west bank or jordan .
but it can take weeks for palestinian bureaucrats to organise referrals and for israel to approve entry .
physicians for human rights says 12 residents have died unnecessarily from their illnesses after israeli officials refused their applications to enter since hamas took power .
aggressive cancer in 2004 , 28-year-old fatma felt a lump in her breast - palestinian doctors said her cure was in having children or switching bras .
months later they diagnosed aggressive cancer but refused to make a referral for her to be treated in israel .
fatma defiantly sent her medical report to an israeli hospital where doctors said she needed immediate care .
israeli activists lobbied defence officials to allow her to enter israel , but she was frequently delayed and turned back by soldiers .
sometimes , her ambulance was forced to return to gaza because of fighting between israeli forces and palestinian militants .
the report says the climatic scene in ' fatenah , ' where she is ordered to disrobe before an israeli woman soldier took place in real-life in september 2004 .
fatenah struggles with palestinian and israeli bureaucracies in the animation , fatenah 's back is to the camera , but she ashamedly reveals a bare shoulder , suggesting she is naked under her long muslim robe .
in reality , fatma wore a tee-shirt and a stuffed bra because her breasts were removed to try to halt the cancer .
she was lying on the floor because she was too weak to stand , and an israeli soldier yelled at her to dress .
the report said she was then sent back into gaza for failing a security check .
sullied reputation the film makers are at pains to say the animation is inspired by fatma 's story , but it is n't about her .
that nuance was lost in deeply conservative gaza , where fatma 's family say it has sullied their deceased daughter 's reputation because of fatenah 's innocent romance - there is n't any kissing or hand-holding - and the brief scene where her animated breast is shown in the movie .
the film took almost two years to make in the west bank city of ramallah on a budget of $ 60,000 -lrb- £ 36,400 -rrb- provided by the world health organisation .
it will be sent to film festivals around the world and mr andoni said he hopes it lays the foundation for what will become a burgeoning palestinian animation industry .

advertisement the story told in fatenah is based on a true case by mohammed harmassi bbc arabic a woman from gaza stands at an israeli check-point .
we can only see her back but it is clear that in shame she opens her top to a female israeli soldier to show that her breasts have been removed in an attempt to beat cancer .
despite this , she is refused entry to israel on security grounds .
this is the climactic scene from the first major palestinian attempt at an animated movie and it is based on a true story .
but this is not an anti-israeli rant .
there are good and bad characters on both sides of the israeli-palestinian divide .
the heroine of the movie is called fatenah .
she is a gazan woman whose dream of finding love and leading a normal life is torn apart by cancer and the conflict between the palestinians and the israelis .
" usually palestinians are treated as numbers , but this is not the case here , " said saed andoni , the film 's producer .
" behind each number there is a long story and that is why we focus on this one individual . "
true story the animation tells of fatenah 's fight against cancer ; the removal of both her breasts , palestinian doctors who delayed her diagnosis and israeli soldiers who delayed her treatment .
it also tells of a rare friendship between the gazan and an israeli woman , dafna .
the animation is threaded together by a love story between fatenah and a gazan man .
the depiction of the impoverished coastal strip is condensed into harshly coloured scenes in the 30-minute animation ; an israeli checkpoint , crowded buildings and the sea .
fatenah has large eyes and a small mouth - symbolic of a woman " compelled to a bitter existence but not empowered to speak " , says director ahmad habash .
fatenah 's struggle and friendship with an israeli woman is based on the real-life story of a gazan woman named fatma .
fatenah shows one woman 's lonely battle to get treatment for breast cancer her fight against breast cancer was told by the israeli group " physicians for human rights " in a 2005 report after the disease killed her .
" the report was so unbelievable , that when you read it you feel like it is fiction .
it is absurd .
you can not believe that these things happen even though we as palestinians live in this situation , " says mr andoni .
health care in gaza is poor - a legacy of poor training , corruption and shabby equipment .
a blockade tightened after militant group hamas seized power of gaza in june 2007 has sealed people in , and kept many medical supplies out .
but israel says it continues to allow in humanitarian goods despite the blockade .
seriously ill residents must find treatment in egypt , israel , or cross from there to the west bank or jordan .
but it can take weeks for palestinian bureaucrats to organise referrals and for israel to approve entry .
physicians for human rights says 12 residents have died unnecessarily from their illnesses after israeli officials refused their applications to enter since hamas took power .
aggressive cancer in 2004 , 28-year-old fatma felt a lump in her breast - palestinian doctors said her cure was in having children or switching bras .
months later they diagnosed aggressive cancer but refused to make a referral for her to be treated in israel .
fatma defiantly sent her medical report to an israeli hospital where doctors said she needed immediate care .
israeli activists lobbied defence officials to allow her to enter israel , but she was frequently delayed and turned back by soldiers .
sometimes , her ambulance was forced to return to gaza because of fighting between israeli forces and palestinian militants .
the report says the climatic scene in ' fatenah , ' where she is ordered to disrobe before an israeli woman soldier took place in real-life in september 2004 .
fatenah struggles with palestinian and israeli bureaucracies in the animation , fatenah 's back is to the camera , but she ashamedly reveals a bare shoulder , suggesting she is naked under her long muslim robe .
in reality , fatma wore a tee-shirt and a stuffed bra because her breasts were removed to try to halt the cancer .
she was lying on the floor because she was too weak to stand , and an israeli soldier yelled at her to dress .
the report said she was then sent back into gaza for failing a security check .
sullied reputation the film makers are at pains to say the animation is inspired by fatma 's story , but it is n't about her .
that nuance was lost in deeply conservative gaza , where fatma 's family say it has sullied their deceased daughter 's reputation because of fatenah 's innocent romance - there is n't any kissing or hand-holding - and the brief scene where her animated breast is shown in the movie .
the film took almost two years to make in the west bank city of ramallah on a budget of $ 60,000 -lrb- £ 36,400 -rrb- provided by the world health organisation .
it will be sent to film festivals around the world and mr andoni said he hopes it lays the foundation for what will become a burgeoning palestinian animation industry .

advertisement the story told in fatenah is based on a true case by mohammed harmassi bbc arabic a woman from gaza stands at an israeli check-point .
we can only see her back but it is clear that in shame she opens her top to a female israeli soldier to show that her breasts have been removed in an attempt to beat cancer .
despite this , she is refused entry to israel on security grounds .
this is the climactic scene from the first major palestinian attempt at an animated movie and it is based on a true story .
but this is not an anti-israeli rant .
there are good and bad characters on both sides of the israeli-palestinian divide .
the heroine of the movie is called fatenah .
she is a gazan woman whose dream of finding love and leading a normal life is torn apart by cancer and the conflict between the palestinians and the israelis .
" usually palestinians are treated as numbers , but this is not the case here , " said saed andoni , the film 's producer .
" behind each number there is a long story and that is why we focus on this one individual . "
true story the animation tells of fatenah 's fight against cancer ; the removal of both her breasts , palestinian doctors who delayed her diagnosis and israeli soldiers who delayed her treatment .
it also tells of a rare friendship between the gazan and an israeli woman , dafna .
the animation is threaded together by a love story between fatenah and a gazan man .
the depiction of the impoverished coastal strip is condensed into harshly coloured scenes in the 30-minute animation ; an israeli checkpoint , crowded buildings and the sea .
fatenah has large eyes and a small mouth - symbolic of a woman " compelled to a bitter existence but not empowered to speak " , says director ahmad habash .
fatenah 's struggle and friendship with an israeli woman is based on the real-life story of a gazan woman named fatma .
fatenah shows one woman 's lonely battle to get treatment for breast cancer her fight against breast cancer was told by the israeli group " physicians for human rights " in a 2005 report after the disease killed her .
" the report was so unbelievable , that when you read it you feel like it is fiction .
it is absurd .
you can not believe that these things happen even though we as palestinians live in this situation , " says mr andoni .
health care in gaza is poor - a legacy of poor training , corruption and shabby equipment .
a blockade tightened after militant group hamas seized power of gaza in june 2007 has sealed people in , and kept many medical supplies out .
but israel says it continues to allow in humanitarian goods despite the blockade .
seriously ill residents must find treatment in egypt , israel , or cross from there to the west bank or jordan .
but it can take weeks for palestinian bureaucrats to organise referrals and for israel to approve entry .
physicians for human rights says 12 residents have died unnecessarily from their illnesses after israeli officials refused their applications to enter since hamas took power .
aggressive cancer in 2004 , 28-year-old fatma felt a lump in her breast - palestinian doctors said her cure was in having children or switching bras .
months later they diagnosed aggressive cancer but refused to make a referral for her to be treated in israel .
fatma defiantly sent her medical report to an israeli hospital where doctors said she needed immediate care .
israeli activists lobbied defence officials to allow her to enter israel , but she was frequently delayed and turned back by soldiers .
sometimes , her ambulance was forced to return to gaza because of fighting between israeli forces and palestinian militants .
the report says the climatic scene in ' fatenah , ' where she is ordered to disrobe before an israeli woman soldier took place in real-life in september 2004 .
fatenah struggles with palestinian and israeli bureaucracies in the animation , fatenah 's back is to the camera , but she ashamedly reveals a bare shoulder , suggesting she is naked under her long muslim robe .
in reality , fatma wore a tee-shirt and a stuffed bra because her breasts were removed to try to halt the cancer .
she was lying on the floor because she was too weak to stand , and an israeli soldier yelled at her to dress .
the report said she was then sent back into gaza for failing a security check .
sullied reputation the film makers are at pains to say the animation is inspired by fatma 's story , but it is n't about her .
that nuance was lost in deeply conservative gaza , where fatma 's family say it has sullied their deceased daughter 's reputation because of fatenah 's innocent romance - there is n't any kissing or hand-holding - and the brief scene where her animated breast is shown in the movie .
the film took almost two years to make in the west bank city of ramallah on a budget of $ 60,000 -lrb- £ 36,400 -rrb- provided by the world health organisation .
it will be sent to film festivals around the world and mr andoni said he hopes it lays the foundation for what will become a burgeoning palestinian animation industry .
