but an essential prerequisite is missing . iceland enjoys full access to the eu 's internal market through the european free trade association and the european economic area , and also complies with most eu laws , officials said . " this means that it would have a lot less homework to do than other applicants from eastern europe .
its membership bid would be faster , " krisztina nagy , spokeswoman of eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . however , nagy would not confirm reports in friday 's guardian that iceland could join the eu as soon as 2011 , saying : " the first precondition is that they apply . " rehn , who comes from finland , was quoted by the british daily as saying that iceland is " one of the oldest democracies in the world . "
" its strategic and economic positions would be an asset to the eu , " rehn said . croatia also vying for eu membership but he also stressed that the eu normally prefers to have more than one applicant join the bloc at any one time , meaning iceland 's entry could be linked to croatia 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's prime minister geir haarde stepped down as the country 's government collapsed croatia , which submitted its application for eu membership in 2003 , wants to finalize negotiations by the end of this year .
but talks with brussels have been slowed down by a border dispute with neighboring slovenia . iceland 's conservative independence party , whose government collapsed this week , has traditionally opposed eu membership .
but observers in reykjavik say it has softened its stance in the wake of the global financial crisis , which pushed the nation of 300,000 inhabitants on the brink of economic ruin . pro-eu campaigners argue that membership of the bloc , and eventually of the euro area , would provide the island with much needed stability . the social democrats , who are in favour of eu membership , are currently in talks to form an interim government with the left-green movement , which opposes membership and is riding high in opinion polls ahead of a snap general election likely to take place in may . fishing ban could pose obstacle officials in brussels note that the biggest stumbling bloc to iceland 's eu membership - besides the fact that the country has not applied for membership yet - concerns the fisheries sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland might have to give up whale hunting if it wants to be part of the eu other eu member states are likely to insist that iceland stick to the eu 's fishing quotas and the bloc 's ban on whale hunting – two issues likely to create resentment among the local population . any transitional arrangements on such issues would be " part of the negotiation process , " nagy said . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to take shared responsibility to honor the outstanding contribution of the citizens of east germany in the peaceful revolution of 1989 , " neumann said after the meeting in berlin .
the federal government will put up five million euros -lrb- $ 6.58 million -rrb- to fund the memorial , the minister said .
the decision to build a unity monument in the eastern german city follows years of controversy .
in 2007 , when the german parliament agreed to erect a monument in berlin to remember the country 's fraught cold war divisions and celebrate the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , about 70 parliamentarians revolted and insisted on building a second monument in leipzig .
at the time , neumann rejected the initiative .
leipzig at the vanguard of peaceful revolution leipzig 's role in helping bring down the east german communist regime is well-documented .
the so-called " monday demonstrations " saw some 70,000 people take to the streets on oct 9 , 1989 with the famous chants of " we are the people . "
in an interview with deutsche welle earlier this month , christian fuehrer , pastor of the nikolai church in leipzig and a leading figure in the monday demonstrations , remembered the extraordinary night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian fuehrer say the enormity of the monday demonstrations only sank in later " everyone was holding a candle , a symbol of non-violence - you need to hold a candle with both hands to keep it from going out , which makes it impossible to throw stones , " fueher said .
" we had a sense that something extraordinary had happened , but we only really understood the enormity of it later . "
the monday demonstrations proved to be a turning point in the peaceful revolution against the east german rulers , encouraging more protests and hastening the opening of the country .
neumann said the monument was designed to give the non-violent demonstrations in leipzig " an own face " and highlight the civil courage of the citizens of the city in fighting a repressive system .

france pushes ahead with plans for a new reactor . on friday , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that while public opinion limits the use of nuclear energy in the european bloc , he is determined to push it as far as possible . " i am ready to go as far as we can go in the union , " he said at a conference in the czech city of ostrava .
" i am personally supporting nuclear energy as an important part of the eu energy mix , " he added during the conference on energy security in europe . nuclear energy faces strong opposition in some eu countries , such as austria .
germany is home to strong anti-nuclear sentiment , although that has been changing as concerns increase about a reliance on foreign energy suppliers and desire grows for cleaner forms of energy production . france does not fall into the group of countries strongly opposed to nuclear energy .
the country has 58 nuclear reactors , which provide approximately 80 percent of its electricity . french president nicolas sarkozy announced late on thursday , jan .
28 , that french energy supplier edf will build the country 's second next-generation epr nuclear reactor at penly , on the english channel , according to the online edition of the daily le figaro .
construction is slated to begin in 2011 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has called sarkozy 's decision " entirely illegitimate " the announcement was met with anger from the environmental group greenpeace , which called the decision " entirely illegitimate and dangerous . " " this decision was taken without any public consultation , open bidding or analysis of energy needs .
it has no justification other than to provide a massive contract to the state-owned nuclear industry , which has a poor safety and environmental record , " said jan beranek , greenpeace 's international energy campaigner . however , as europe emerges from a gas crisis caused by a row between ukraine and russia that cut off supplies in the middle of winter , nuclear energy is being reconsidered by some . number of reactors set to increase czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , also underlined the value of nuclear energy . " do we want to have sustainable energy with low emissions ? " he asked , adding that nuclear energy was the only way to achieve that goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants from the 60s and 70s are shutting down france is n't the only country set to build an epr reactor .
finland is also constructing a facility and china is slated to build two . nuclear power plants currently produce around a third of the eu 's electricity and around 15 percent of its total energy , but that statistic is dwindling as plants built in the 1960s and 1970s come to the end of their lives . france and germany have developed an as yet untested third-generation pressurized water reactor , and eu energy commissioner piebalgs announced that a nuclear energy forum to discuss new investments in the field would take place in prague this spring . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians have condemned the order . a us general in kabul and a german general overseeing nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- from europe have told nato supreme commander general john craddock of the united states that his order is illegal . craddock had sent a confidential document to nato commanders saying he wanted troops in the 50,000-strong military alliance " to attack directly drug producers and facilities throughout afghanistan . "
the documents told nato troops to use lethal force against opium traders without requiring intelligence data to prove they were passing money to the islamic fundamentalist taliban or in rebellion against the kabul government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general egon ramms -lrb- r -rrb- responded as a " civilian in uniform , " the greens said the web site of the news magazine der spiegel reported that german general egon ramms , who heads a command overseeing isaf from brunssum , the netherlands , and us general david mckiernan , commander of isaf troops in afghanistan , told craddock the order was in breach of their rules of engagement and the laws of armed conflict . nato launches inquiry into leak their stance largely aligns with berlin 's concerns about " mission creep , " a term for isaf taking on new tasks that puts it at odds with ordinary afghans whose goodwill is essential to armed peacekeepers . german military sources in berlin confirmed there was a dispute under way .

" he has not , and never has , issued illegal orders , " the nato statement said . many german politicians , however , are demanding further explanation . in the friday edition of the berliner zeitung , spd defense spokesman rainer arnold , described craddock 's order as " wrong " and said nato should take a clear position , as otherwise , " farmers in their fields will soon be targeted . " isaf committed to avoiding civilian deaths european mp and cdu defense expert karl von wogau told the paper that craddock 's letter was " an illegal order " that endangered innocent civilians .

general ramms , on the other hand , was praised by the greens for acting as a " citizen in a nato uniform . " der spiegel has also published extracts from a classified response from general mckiernan 's office in kabul that accuses craddock of attempting to " seriously undermine the commitment isaf has made to the afghan people to restrain our use of force and avoid civilian casualties . " german defense minister franz-josef jung has not commented directly on the debate .
his spokesperson said only that this is an internal dispute within nato and that the minister is not going to get involved . a defense ministry spokesman told german news agency dpa that german forces provided logistics and intelligence support to afghan security forces fighting drug gangs , but that german soldiers did not participate in lethal operations which might target drug dealers who were not demonstrably rebels . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog welcomed obama 's overtures and called for direct talks without conditions .
" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .
but earlier this week , iran 's hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad demanded obama apologize for past us " crimes " against the islamic republic . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but an essential prerequisite is missing . iceland enjoys full access to the eu 's internal market through the european free trade association and the european economic area , and also complies with most eu laws , officials said . " this means that it would have a lot less homework to do than other applicants from eastern europe .
its membership bid would be faster , " krisztina nagy , spokeswoman of eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . however , nagy would not confirm reports in friday 's guardian that iceland could join the eu as soon as 2011 , saying : " the first precondition is that they apply . " rehn , who comes from finland , was quoted by the british daily as saying that iceland is " one of the oldest democracies in the world . "
" its strategic and economic positions would be an asset to the eu , " rehn said . croatia also vying for eu membership but he also stressed that the eu normally prefers to have more than one applicant join the bloc at any one time , meaning iceland 's entry could be linked to croatia 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's prime minister geir haarde stepped down as the country 's government collapsed croatia , which submitted its application for eu membership in 2003 , wants to finalize negotiations by the end of this year .
but talks with brussels have been slowed down by a border dispute with neighboring slovenia . iceland 's conservative independence party , whose government collapsed this week , has traditionally opposed eu membership .
but observers in reykjavik say it has softened its stance in the wake of the global financial crisis , which pushed the nation of 300,000 inhabitants on the brink of economic ruin . pro-eu campaigners argue that membership of the bloc , and eventually of the euro area , would provide the island with much needed stability . the social democrats , who are in favour of eu membership , are currently in talks to form an interim government with the left-green movement , which opposes membership and is riding high in opinion polls ahead of a snap general election likely to take place in may . fishing ban could pose obstacle officials in brussels note that the biggest stumbling bloc to iceland 's eu membership - besides the fact that the country has not applied for membership yet - concerns the fisheries sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland might have to give up whale hunting if it wants to be part of the eu other eu member states are likely to insist that iceland stick to the eu 's fishing quotas and the bloc 's ban on whale hunting – two issues likely to create resentment among the local population . any transitional arrangements on such issues would be " part of the negotiation process , " nagy said . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians have condemned the order . a us general in kabul and a german general overseeing nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- from europe have told nato supreme commander general john craddock of the united states that his order is illegal . craddock had sent a confidential document to nato commanders saying he wanted troops in the 50,000-strong military alliance " to attack directly drug producers and facilities throughout afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 30.01.2009 top la curator breaks the east-west divide in german art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ar penck 's ' passage ' is one of the works in the show ; click on the gallery below for more cold war art from both east and west germany is the focus of a new exhibition at the los angeles county museum of art , which has already received considerable attention .
dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : the pope 's high price for reintegration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current scandal over pope benedict 's decision to rehabilitate a holocaust denier into the church shows that the price for catholic unity might be too high to pay , says dw 's clemens finzer . " ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .
the pope 's wish that all may become one - " ut omnes unum sint " - clearly also applies to the reintegration of the pius society .
but not at any price . clemens finzer covers religion for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : erdogan discredited as mediator after davos row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan 's stormy exit from a panel discussion on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip at the davos summit has discredited him as a mediator in the region , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . recep tayyip erdogan 's performance at the world economic forum in davos has destroyed any hopes that had been pinned on him to act a mediator in the middle east conflict .
erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : erdogan discredited as mediator after davos row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan 's stormy exit from a panel discussion on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip at the davos summit has discredited him as a mediator in the region , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . recep tayyip erdogan 's performance at the world economic forum in davos has destroyed any hopes that had been pinned on him to act a mediator in the middle east conflict .
erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .
maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are so strong in your words .
you killed people .
i remember the children who died on beaches , " erdogan said , through an interpreter .
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt , " accusing him of " knowing very well how to kill babies . "
the turkish leader said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud peres for defending israel 's actions .
erdogan then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .
erdogan gets hero 's welcome in istanbul on friday , thousands of turks turned out at the airport in istanbul to welcome recep tayyip erdogan returning home from davos .
the crowds waved turkish and palestinian flags and held up banners reading , " welcome back conqueror of davos , " and " world , look at our prime minister . "
many turks are deeply sympathetic to palestinians and the recent israeli military action in the gaza strip prompted scores of large pro-gaza demonstrations in istanbul and ankara .
news agencies have reported that erdogan 's actions are likely to go down well with the electorate ahead of local elections in march .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .
" he addressed me in a style which does not fit in with the free discussion style of davos .
he raised his voice at me , " said erdogan of peres ' manner during the session .
schwab said the incident was " regrettable " and did not fit with the " davos spirit . "
erdogan says rhetoric meant for israeli government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan was treated like a hero by thousands of cheering supporters turkey , a nato member , is one of the few muslim countries to have dealings with israel and the two have enjoyed good relations in recent years .
but erdogan has been a staunch critic of israel 's actions in gaza .
speaking to the crowds in istanbul on friday , erdogan said that " our hard words are not directed towards the people of israel , not directed at the jews , but they are totally directed towards the government of israel " .
some 1,300 palestinians were killed during the israeli offensive in the gaza strip , along with 13 israelis . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .
the pope 's wish that all may become one - " ut omnes unum sint " - clearly also applies to the reintegration of the pius society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : the pope 's high price for reintegration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current scandal over pope benedict 's decision to rehabilitate a holocaust denier into the church shows that the price for catholic unity might be too high to pay , says dw 's clemens finzer . " ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .
the pope 's wish that all may become one - " ut omnes unum sint " - clearly also applies to the reintegration of the pius society .
but not at any price . clemens finzer covers religion for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france pushes ahead with plans for a new reactor . on friday , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that while public opinion limits the use of nuclear energy in the european bloc , he is determined to push it as far as possible . " i am ready to go as far as we can go in the union , " he said at a conference in the czech city of ostrava .
" i am personally supporting nuclear energy as an important part of the eu energy mix , " he added during the conference on energy security in europe . nuclear energy faces strong opposition in some eu countries , such as austria .
germany is home to strong anti-nuclear sentiment , although that has been changing as concerns increase about a reliance on foreign energy suppliers and desire grows for cleaner forms of energy production . france does not fall into the group of countries strongly opposed to nuclear energy .
the country has 58 nuclear reactors , which provide approximately 80 percent of its electricity . french president nicolas sarkozy announced late on thursday , jan .
28 , that french energy supplier edf will build the country 's second next-generation epr nuclear reactor at penly , on the english channel , according to the online edition of the daily le figaro .
construction is slated to begin in 2011 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has called sarkozy 's decision " entirely illegitimate " the announcement was met with anger from the environmental group greenpeace , which called the decision " entirely illegitimate and dangerous . " " this decision was taken without any public consultation , open bidding or analysis of energy needs .
it has no justification other than to provide a massive contract to the state-owned nuclear industry , which has a poor safety and environmental record , " said jan beranek , greenpeace 's international energy campaigner . however , as europe emerges from a gas crisis caused by a row between ukraine and russia that cut off supplies in the middle of winter , nuclear energy is being reconsidered by some . number of reactors set to increase czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , also underlined the value of nuclear energy . " do we want to have sustainable energy with low emissions ? " he asked , adding that nuclear energy was the only way to achieve that goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants from the 60s and 70s are shutting down france is n't the only country set to build an epr reactor .
finland is also constructing a facility and china is slated to build two . nuclear power plants currently produce around a third of the eu 's electricity and around 15 percent of its total energy , but that statistic is dwindling as plants built in the 1960s and 1970s come to the end of their lives . france and germany have developed an as yet untested third-generation pressurized water reactor , and eu energy commissioner piebalgs announced that a nuclear energy forum to discuss new investments in the field would take place in prague this spring . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france pushes ahead with plans for a new reactor . on friday , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that while public opinion limits the use of nuclear energy in the european bloc , he is determined to push it as far as possible . " i am ready to go as far as we can go in the union , " he said at a conference in the czech city of ostrava .
" i am personally supporting nuclear energy as an important part of the eu energy mix , " he added during the conference on energy security in europe . nuclear energy faces strong opposition in some eu countries , such as austria .
germany is home to strong anti-nuclear sentiment , although that has been changing as concerns increase about a reliance on foreign energy suppliers and desire grows for cleaner forms of energy production . france does not fall into the group of countries strongly opposed to nuclear energy .
the country has 58 nuclear reactors , which provide approximately 80 percent of its electricity . french president nicolas sarkozy announced late on thursday , jan .
28 , that french energy supplier edf will build the country 's second next-generation epr nuclear reactor at penly , on the english channel , according to the online edition of the daily le figaro .
construction is slated to begin in 2011 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has called sarkozy 's decision " entirely illegitimate " the announcement was met with anger from the environmental group greenpeace , which called the decision " entirely illegitimate and dangerous . " " this decision was taken without any public consultation , open bidding or analysis of energy needs .
it has no justification other than to provide a massive contract to the state-owned nuclear industry , which has a poor safety and environmental record , " said jan beranek , greenpeace 's international energy campaigner . however , as europe emerges from a gas crisis caused by a row between ukraine and russia that cut off supplies in the middle of winter , nuclear energy is being reconsidered by some . number of reactors set to increase czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , also underlined the value of nuclear energy . " do we want to have sustainable energy with low emissions ? " he asked , adding that nuclear energy was the only way to achieve that goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants from the 60s and 70s are shutting down france is n't the only country set to build an epr reactor .
finland is also constructing a facility and china is slated to build two . nuclear power plants currently produce around a third of the eu 's electricity and around 15 percent of its total energy , but that statistic is dwindling as plants built in the 1960s and 1970s come to the end of their lives . france and germany have developed an as yet untested third-generation pressurized water reactor , and eu energy commissioner piebalgs announced that a nuclear energy forum to discuss new investments in the field would take place in prague this spring . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : the pope 's high price for reintegration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current scandal over pope benedict 's decision to rehabilitate a holocaust denier into the church shows that the price for catholic unity might be too high to pay , says dw 's clemens finzer . " ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .
the pope 's wish that all may become one - " ut omnes unum sint " - clearly also applies to the reintegration of the pius society .
but not at any price . clemens finzer covers religion for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the one thing we can be absolutely certain about is that if a bill is passed which prohibits the sale or purchase of european goods on american territory , that is not something we will stand idly by and ignore , " european commission trade spokesman peter power told journalists in brussels .
on wednesday , the us house of representatives approved a 622-billion-euro -lrb- $ 819 billion -rrb- stimulus package designed to jolt the country 's economy out of its worst recession since world war ii .
alarm bells are ringing the package calls for investments in infrastructure , renewable energy , health , education and other sectors , together with sweeping tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package calls for investments in infrastructure , like highways but alarm bells have rung in europe over the bill 's plans to extend the so-called " buy american " provision , originally enacted in 1933 , to ban foreign-made iron and steel from most of the new infrastructure projects .
the legislation now moves to the us senate and the " buy american " provisions could yet be scrapped .
but a version of the text due to be discussed by the senate next week goes further , barring all foreign-made goods from being used in all stimulus-funded initiatives .
us president barack obama , who has made the stimulus bill a cornerstone of his economic plans , has not commented specifically on the provisions .
but he has said that its focus must be on creating more than three million jobs in the united states .
still early power said that it was too early for the commission - the eu 's executive - to comment on the act as a whole , since it had not yet become law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us have a string of cases pending at the wto , like the one involving hormone-treated beef " before we have the final shape of that particular bill it would be premature to take a stance on it , " he said .
the us and the eu are one another 's main trading partners , with trade flows topping 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.25 billion -rrb- a day , according to commission figures .
however , they have regularly clashed over questions of trade barriers , with a string of cases pending in the world trade organization on issues ranging from a european ban on hormone-treated beef to us anti-dumping tariffs on french uranium .

" we want to take shared responsibility to honor the outstanding contribution of the citizens of east germany in the peaceful revolution of 1989 , " neumann said after the meeting in berlin .
the federal government will put up five million euros -lrb- $ 6.58 million -rrb- to fund the memorial , the minister said .
the decision to build a unity monument in the eastern german city follows years of controversy .
in 2007 , when the german parliament agreed to erect a monument in berlin to remember the country 's fraught cold war divisions and celebrate the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , about 70 parliamentarians revolted and insisted on building a second monument in leipzig .
at the time , neumann rejected the initiative .
leipzig at the vanguard of peaceful revolution leipzig 's role in helping bring down the east german communist regime is well-documented .
the so-called " monday demonstrations " saw some 70,000 people take to the streets on oct 9 , 1989 with the famous chants of " we are the people . "
in an interview with deutsche welle earlier this month , christian fuehrer , pastor of the nikolai church in leipzig and a leading figure in the monday demonstrations , remembered the extraordinary night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian fuehrer say the enormity of the monday demonstrations only sank in later " everyone was holding a candle , a symbol of non-violence - you need to hold a candle with both hands to keep it from going out , which makes it impossible to throw stones , " fueher said .
" we had a sense that something extraordinary had happened , but we only really understood the enormity of it later . "
the monday demonstrations proved to be a turning point in the peaceful revolution against the east german rulers , encouraging more protests and hastening the opening of the country .
neumann said the monument was designed to give the non-violent demonstrations in leipzig " an own face " and highlight the civil courage of the citizens of the city in fighting a repressive system .
the german capital too is slated to get its own memorial to commemorate german unity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .

german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog welcomed obama 's overtures and called for direct talks without conditions .
" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .
but earlier this week , iran 's hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad demanded obama apologize for past us " crimes " against the islamic republic . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .

" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog welcomed obama 's overtures and called for direct talks without conditions .
" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .
but earlier this week , iran 's hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad demanded obama apologize for past us " crimes " against the islamic republic . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france pushes ahead with plans for a new reactor . on friday , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that while public opinion limits the use of nuclear energy in the european bloc , he is determined to push it as far as possible . " i am ready to go as far as we can go in the union , " he said at a conference in the czech city of ostrava .
" i am personally supporting nuclear energy as an important part of the eu energy mix , " he added during the conference on energy security in europe . nuclear energy faces strong opposition in some eu countries , such as austria .
germany is home to strong anti-nuclear sentiment , although that has been changing as concerns increase about a reliance on foreign energy suppliers and desire grows for cleaner forms of energy production . france does not fall into the group of countries strongly opposed to nuclear energy .
the country has 58 nuclear reactors , which provide approximately 80 percent of its electricity . french president nicolas sarkozy announced late on thursday , jan .
28 , that french energy supplier edf will build the country 's second next-generation epr nuclear reactor at penly , on the english channel , according to the online edition of the daily le figaro .
construction is slated to begin in 2011 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has called sarkozy 's decision " entirely illegitimate " the announcement was met with anger from the environmental group greenpeace , which called the decision " entirely illegitimate and dangerous . " " this decision was taken without any public consultation , open bidding or analysis of energy needs .
it has no justification other than to provide a massive contract to the state-owned nuclear industry , which has a poor safety and environmental record , " said jan beranek , greenpeace 's international energy campaigner . however , as europe emerges from a gas crisis caused by a row between ukraine and russia that cut off supplies in the middle of winter , nuclear energy is being reconsidered by some . number of reactors set to increase czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , also underlined the value of nuclear energy . " do we want to have sustainable energy with low emissions ? " he asked , adding that nuclear energy was the only way to achieve that goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants from the 60s and 70s are shutting down france is n't the only country set to build an epr reactor .
finland is also constructing a facility and china is slated to build two . nuclear power plants currently produce around a third of the eu 's electricity and around 15 percent of its total energy , but that statistic is dwindling as plants built in the 1960s and 1970s come to the end of their lives . france and germany have developed an as yet untested third-generation pressurized water reactor , and eu energy commissioner piebalgs announced that a nuclear energy forum to discuss new investments in the field would take place in prague this spring . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .

" ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .
the pope 's wish that all may become one - " ut omnes unum sint " - clearly also applies to the reintegration of the pius society .
but not at any price . clemens finzer covers religion for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .
maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are so strong in your words .
you killed people .
i remember the children who died on beaches , " erdogan said , through an interpreter .
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt , " accusing him of " knowing very well how to kill babies . "
the turkish leader said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud peres for defending israel 's actions .
erdogan then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .

the crowds waved turkish and palestinian flags and held up banners reading , " welcome back conqueror of davos , " and " world , look at our prime minister . "
many turks are deeply sympathetic to palestinians and the recent israeli military action in the gaza strip prompted scores of large pro-gaza demonstrations in istanbul and ankara .
news agencies have reported that erdogan 's actions are likely to go down well with the electorate ahead of local elections in march .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .
" he addressed me in a style which does not fit in with the free discussion style of davos .

at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .
" he addressed me in a style which does not fit in with the free discussion style of davos .
he raised his voice at me , " said erdogan of peres ' manner during the session .
schwab said the incident was " regrettable " and did not fit with the " davos spirit . "

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .
maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are so strong in your words .
you killed people .
i remember the children who died on beaches , " erdogan said , through an interpreter .
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt , " accusing him of " knowing very well how to kill babies . "
the turkish leader said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud peres for defending israel 's actions .
erdogan then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .
erdogan gets hero 's welcome in istanbul on friday , thousands of turks turned out at the airport in istanbul to welcome recep tayyip erdogan returning home from davos .
the crowds waved turkish and palestinian flags and held up banners reading , " welcome back conqueror of davos , " and " world , look at our prime minister . "
many turks are deeply sympathetic to palestinians and the recent israeli military action in the gaza strip prompted scores of large pro-gaza demonstrations in istanbul and ankara .
news agencies have reported that erdogan 's actions are likely to go down well with the electorate ahead of local elections in march .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : erdogan discredited as mediator after davos row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan 's stormy exit from a panel discussion on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip at the davos summit has discredited him as a mediator in the region , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . recep tayyip erdogan 's performance at the world economic forum in davos has destroyed any hopes that had been pinned on him to act a mediator in the middle east conflict .
erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

the federal government will put up five million euros -lrb- $ 6.58 million -rrb- to fund the memorial , the minister said .
the decision to build a unity monument in the eastern german city follows years of controversy .
in 2007 , when the german parliament agreed to erect a monument in berlin to remember the country 's fraught cold war divisions and celebrate the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , about 70 parliamentarians revolted and insisted on building a second monument in leipzig .
at the time , neumann rejected the initiative .
leipzig at the vanguard of peaceful revolution leipzig 's role in helping bring down the east german communist regime is well-documented .
the so-called " monday demonstrations " saw some 70,000 people take to the streets on oct 9 , 1989 with the famous chants of " we are the people . "
in an interview with deutsche welle earlier this month , christian fuehrer , pastor of the nikolai church in leipzig and a leading figure in the monday demonstrations , remembered the extraordinary night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian fuehrer say the enormity of the monday demonstrations only sank in later " everyone was holding a candle , a symbol of non-violence - you need to hold a candle with both hands to keep it from going out , which makes it impossible to throw stones , " fueher said .
" we had a sense that something extraordinary had happened , but we only really understood the enormity of it later . "
the monday demonstrations proved to be a turning point in the peaceful revolution against the east german rulers , encouraging more protests and hastening the opening of the country .
neumann said the monument was designed to give the non-violent demonstrations in leipzig " an own face " and highlight the civil courage of the citizens of the city in fighting a repressive system .

but an essential prerequisite is missing . iceland enjoys full access to the eu 's internal market through the european free trade association and the european economic area , and also complies with most eu laws , officials said . " this means that it would have a lot less homework to do than other applicants from eastern europe .
its membership bid would be faster , " krisztina nagy , spokeswoman of eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . however , nagy would not confirm reports in friday 's guardian that iceland could join the eu as soon as 2011 , saying : " the first precondition is that they apply . " rehn , who comes from finland , was quoted by the british daily as saying that iceland is " one of the oldest democracies in the world . "
" its strategic and economic positions would be an asset to the eu , " rehn said . croatia also vying for eu membership but he also stressed that the eu normally prefers to have more than one applicant join the bloc at any one time , meaning iceland 's entry could be linked to croatia 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's prime minister geir haarde stepped down as the country 's government collapsed croatia , which submitted its application for eu membership in 2003 , wants to finalize negotiations by the end of this year .
but talks with brussels have been slowed down by a border dispute with neighboring slovenia . iceland 's conservative independence party , whose government collapsed this week , has traditionally opposed eu membership .
but observers in reykjavik say it has softened its stance in the wake of the global financial crisis , which pushed the nation of 300,000 inhabitants on the brink of economic ruin . pro-eu campaigners argue that membership of the bloc , and eventually of the euro area , would provide the island with much needed stability . the social democrats , who are in favour of eu membership , are currently in talks to form an interim government with the left-green movement , which opposes membership and is riding high in opinion polls ahead of a snap general election likely to take place in may . fishing ban could pose obstacle officials in brussels note that the biggest stumbling bloc to iceland 's eu membership - besides the fact that the country has not applied for membership yet - concerns the fisheries sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland might have to give up whale hunting if it wants to be part of the eu other eu member states are likely to insist that iceland stick to the eu 's fishing quotas and the bloc 's ban on whale hunting – two issues likely to create resentment among the local population . any transitional arrangements on such issues would be " part of the negotiation process , " nagy said . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians have condemned the order . a us general in kabul and a german general overseeing nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- from europe have told nato supreme commander general john craddock of the united states that his order is illegal . craddock had sent a confidential document to nato commanders saying he wanted troops in the 50,000-strong military alliance " to attack directly drug producers and facilities throughout afghanistan . "
the documents told nato troops to use lethal force against opium traders without requiring intelligence data to prove they were passing money to the islamic fundamentalist taliban or in rebellion against the kabul government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general egon ramms -lrb- r -rrb- responded as a " civilian in uniform , " the greens said the web site of the news magazine der spiegel reported that german general egon ramms , who heads a command overseeing isaf from brunssum , the netherlands , and us general david mckiernan , commander of isaf troops in afghanistan , told craddock the order was in breach of their rules of engagement and the laws of armed conflict . nato launches inquiry into leak their stance largely aligns with berlin 's concerns about " mission creep , " a term for isaf taking on new tasks that puts it at odds with ordinary afghans whose goodwill is essential to armed peacekeepers . german military sources in berlin confirmed there was a dispute under way .
on thursday , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer launched an inquiry into the " unacceptable " leaking of confidential military documents on how to deal with afghan drug traders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's supreme commander , general john craddock a nato statement said that craddock was tasked with implementing the pursuit of druglords and laboratories which are generating funds for the taliban , and that he " issued general guidance as a follow-up " so that troops could begin operations . " he has not , and never has , issued illegal orders , " the nato statement said . many german politicians , however , are demanding further explanation . in the friday edition of the berliner zeitung , spd defense spokesman rainer arnold , described craddock 's order as " wrong " and said nato should take a clear position , as otherwise , " farmers in their fields will soon be targeted . " isaf committed to avoiding civilian deaths european mp and cdu defense expert karl von wogau told the paper that craddock 's letter was " an illegal order " that endangered innocent civilians .
and members of the opposition green party have demanded that craddock resign from his post .
general ramms , on the other hand , was praised by the greens for acting as a " citizen in a nato uniform . " der spiegel has also published extracts from a classified response from general mckiernan 's office in kabul that accuses craddock of attempting to " seriously undermine the commitment isaf has made to the afghan people to restrain our use of force and avoid civilian casualties . " german defense minister franz-josef jung has not commented directly on the debate .
his spokesperson said only that this is an internal dispute within nato and that the minister is not going to get involved . a defense ministry spokesman told german news agency dpa that german forces provided logistics and intelligence support to afghan security forces fighting drug gangs , but that german soldiers did not participate in lethal operations which might target drug dealers who were not demonstrably rebels . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france pushes ahead with plans for a new reactor . on friday , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that while public opinion limits the use of nuclear energy in the european bloc , he is determined to push it as far as possible . " i am ready to go as far as we can go in the union , " he said at a conference in the czech city of ostrava .
" i am personally supporting nuclear energy as an important part of the eu energy mix , " he added during the conference on energy security in europe . nuclear energy faces strong opposition in some eu countries , such as austria .
germany is home to strong anti-nuclear sentiment , although that has been changing as concerns increase about a reliance on foreign energy suppliers and desire grows for cleaner forms of energy production . france does not fall into the group of countries strongly opposed to nuclear energy .
the country has 58 nuclear reactors , which provide approximately 80 percent of its electricity . french president nicolas sarkozy announced late on thursday , jan .
28 , that french energy supplier edf will build the country 's second next-generation epr nuclear reactor at penly , on the english channel , according to the online edition of the daily le figaro .
construction is slated to begin in 2011 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has called sarkozy 's decision " entirely illegitimate " the announcement was met with anger from the environmental group greenpeace , which called the decision " entirely illegitimate and dangerous . " " this decision was taken without any public consultation , open bidding or analysis of energy needs .
it has no justification other than to provide a massive contract to the state-owned nuclear industry , which has a poor safety and environmental record , " said jan beranek , greenpeace 's international energy campaigner . however , as europe emerges from a gas crisis caused by a row between ukraine and russia that cut off supplies in the middle of winter , nuclear energy is being reconsidered by some . number of reactors set to increase czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , also underlined the value of nuclear energy . " do we want to have sustainable energy with low emissions ? " he asked , adding that nuclear energy was the only way to achieve that goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants from the 60s and 70s are shutting down france is n't the only country set to build an epr reactor .
finland is also constructing a facility and china is slated to build two . nuclear power plants currently produce around a third of the eu 's electricity and around 15 percent of its total energy , but that statistic is dwindling as plants built in the 1960s and 1970s come to the end of their lives . france and germany have developed an as yet untested third-generation pressurized water reactor , and eu energy commissioner piebalgs announced that a nuclear energy forum to discuss new investments in the field would take place in prague this spring . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the legislation now moves to the us senate and the " buy american " provisions could yet be scrapped .
but a version of the text due to be discussed by the senate next week goes further , barring all foreign-made goods from being used in all stimulus-funded initiatives .
us president barack obama , who has made the stimulus bill a cornerstone of his economic plans , has not commented specifically on the provisions .

" as long as china and the european union work hand-in-hand , we will be able to overcome the financial crisis and get through the tough times , " he said . the two sides signed nine deals worth close to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- on issues ranging from student exchanges to civil aviation . tensions between the eu and china have risen in recent times , particularly when china cancelled a december summit with the eu following french president nicolas sarkozy 's decision to meet with the dalai lama .
but after the meeting in brussels , wen and european commission president jose manuel barroso also announced that a china-eu summit would take place soon . " we have decided today we will soon have a new summit between the european union and china , " barroso told a news conference after meeting wen . trade imbalance leads to friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was enraged when sarkozy met with the dalai lama with trade between china and the eu booming in recent years to some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- , officials in brussels warned china about the need to keep markets open .
a trade imbalance with china perpetuated by the fact that europe 's imports from china have grown by about 21 percent for roughly the last five years , has led to frictions . " globally we face an economic crisis without precedent in the postwar era and no one can claim to be completely immune .
it is important that we address those issues in a global spirit , " said barroso . the chinese delegation to brussels also signed several agreements with the eu on matters ranging from counterfeiting and piracy to illegal logging , mine safety and civil aviation . summarizing the relations between beijing and brussels , wen said that " all things are moving ahead amid twists and turns . " as part of his european tour , chinese premier 's wen 's visited berlin on the previous day , where he met with german chancellor angela merkel in a joint statement , germany and china said on thursday that they wanted to reform the international financial system and ensure concrete results at a meeting of leaders from the group of 20 nations in april . exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade between germany and china blossomed in 2008 wen also defended the yuan exchange rate as " reasonable and balanced " against us accusations that beijing was manipulating its currency to boost exports and demands that china let the currency appreciate . wen said china 's foreign exchange rate policy stuck " to the principle that it is oriented towards market needs and the exchange rate is flexible or bound to a currency basket . " he acknowledged that global currencies were facing dramatic fluctuations - comparing the ups and downs to a " rollercoaster " - but sharply rejected charges that china was exercising undue influence over exchange rates . " the fault is not with china , " he said . trade between germany and china grew significantly in 2008 and both wen and merkel said there were aiming for least an equal trade volume this year . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog welcomed obama 's overtures and called for direct talks without conditions .
" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .
but earlier this week , iran 's hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad demanded obama apologize for past us " crimes " against the islamic republic . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog welcomed obama 's overtures and called for direct talks without conditions .
" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .

" ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .
the pope 's wish that all may become one - " ut omnes unum sint " - clearly also applies to the reintegration of the pius society .

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .
maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are so strong in your words .
you killed people .
i remember the children who died on beaches , " erdogan said , through an interpreter .
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt , " accusing him of " knowing very well how to kill babies . "
the turkish leader said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud peres for defending israel 's actions .
erdogan then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .
erdogan gets hero 's welcome in istanbul on friday , thousands of turks turned out at the airport in istanbul to welcome recep tayyip erdogan returning home from davos .
the crowds waved turkish and palestinian flags and held up banners reading , " welcome back conqueror of davos , " and " world , look at our prime minister . "
many turks are deeply sympathetic to palestinians and the recent israeli military action in the gaza strip prompted scores of large pro-gaza demonstrations in istanbul and ankara .
news agencies have reported that erdogan 's actions are likely to go down well with the electorate ahead of local elections in march .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .
" he addressed me in a style which does not fit in with the free discussion style of davos .
he raised his voice at me , " said erdogan of peres ' manner during the session .
schwab said the incident was " regrettable " and did not fit with the " davos spirit . "
erdogan says rhetoric meant for israeli government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan was treated like a hero by thousands of cheering supporters turkey , a nato member , is one of the few muslim countries to have dealings with israel and the two have enjoyed good relations in recent years .
but erdogan has been a staunch critic of israel 's actions in gaza .
speaking to the crowds in istanbul on friday , erdogan said that " our hard words are not directed towards the people of israel , not directed at the jews , but they are totally directed towards the government of israel " .

erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .
maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are so strong in your words .
you killed people .
i remember the children who died on beaches , " erdogan said , through an interpreter .
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt , " accusing him of " knowing very well how to kill babies . "
the turkish leader said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud peres for defending israel 's actions .
erdogan then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .
erdogan gets hero 's welcome in istanbul on friday , thousands of turks turned out at the airport in istanbul to welcome recep tayyip erdogan returning home from davos .
the crowds waved turkish and palestinian flags and held up banners reading , " welcome back conqueror of davos , " and " world , look at our prime minister . "
many turks are deeply sympathetic to palestinians and the recent israeli military action in the gaza strip prompted scores of large pro-gaza demonstrations in istanbul and ankara .
news agencies have reported that erdogan 's actions are likely to go down well with the electorate ahead of local elections in march .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .
" he addressed me in a style which does not fit in with the free discussion style of davos .
he raised his voice at me , " said erdogan of peres ' manner during the session .
schwab said the incident was " regrettable " and did not fit with the " davos spirit . "
erdogan says rhetoric meant for israeli government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan was treated like a hero by thousands of cheering supporters turkey , a nato member , is one of the few muslim countries to have dealings with israel and the two have enjoyed good relations in recent years .

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .
maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are so strong in your words .
you killed people .
i remember the children who died on beaches , " erdogan said , through an interpreter .
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt , " accusing him of " knowing very well how to kill babies . "

the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .
" he addressed me in a style which does not fit in with the free discussion style of davos .

" we want to take shared responsibility to honor the outstanding contribution of the citizens of east germany in the peaceful revolution of 1989 , " neumann said after the meeting in berlin .
the federal government will put up five million euros -lrb- $ 6.58 million -rrb- to fund the memorial , the minister said .
the decision to build a unity monument in the eastern german city follows years of controversy .
in 2007 , when the german parliament agreed to erect a monument in berlin to remember the country 's fraught cold war divisions and celebrate the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , about 70 parliamentarians revolted and insisted on building a second monument in leipzig .

" we had a sense that something extraordinary had happened , but we only really understood the enormity of it later . "
the monday demonstrations proved to be a turning point in the peaceful revolution against the east german rulers , encouraging more protests and hastening the opening of the country .

german politicians have condemned the order . a us general in kabul and a german general overseeing nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- from europe have told nato supreme commander general john craddock of the united states that his order is illegal . craddock had sent a confidential document to nato commanders saying he wanted troops in the 50,000-strong military alliance " to attack directly drug producers and facilities throughout afghanistan . "
the documents told nato troops to use lethal force against opium traders without requiring intelligence data to prove they were passing money to the islamic fundamentalist taliban or in rebellion against the kabul government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general egon ramms -lrb- r -rrb- responded as a " civilian in uniform , " the greens said the web site of the news magazine der spiegel reported that german general egon ramms , who heads a command overseeing isaf from brunssum , the netherlands , and us general david mckiernan , commander of isaf troops in afghanistan , told craddock the order was in breach of their rules of engagement and the laws of armed conflict . nato launches inquiry into leak their stance largely aligns with berlin 's concerns about " mission creep , " a term for isaf taking on new tasks that puts it at odds with ordinary afghans whose goodwill is essential to armed peacekeepers . german military sources in berlin confirmed there was a dispute under way .
on thursday , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer launched an inquiry into the " unacceptable " leaking of confidential military documents on how to deal with afghan drug traders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's supreme commander , general john craddock a nato statement said that craddock was tasked with implementing the pursuit of druglords and laboratories which are generating funds for the taliban , and that he " issued general guidance as a follow-up " so that troops could begin operations . " he has not , and never has , issued illegal orders , " the nato statement said . many german politicians , however , are demanding further explanation . in the friday edition of the berliner zeitung , spd defense spokesman rainer arnold , described craddock 's order as " wrong " and said nato should take a clear position , as otherwise , " farmers in their fields will soon be targeted . " isaf committed to avoiding civilian deaths european mp and cdu defense expert karl von wogau told the paper that craddock 's letter was " an illegal order " that endangered innocent civilians .
and members of the opposition green party have demanded that craddock resign from his post .
general ramms , on the other hand , was praised by the greens for acting as a " citizen in a nato uniform . " der spiegel has also published extracts from a classified response from general mckiernan 's office in kabul that accuses craddock of attempting to " seriously undermine the commitment isaf has made to the afghan people to restrain our use of force and avoid civilian casualties . " german defense minister franz-josef jung has not commented directly on the debate .
his spokesperson said only that this is an internal dispute within nato and that the minister is not going to get involved . a defense ministry spokesman told german news agency dpa that german forces provided logistics and intelligence support to afghan security forces fighting drug gangs , but that german soldiers did not participate in lethal operations which might target drug dealers who were not demonstrably rebels . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the one thing we can be absolutely certain about is that if a bill is passed which prohibits the sale or purchase of european goods on american territory , that is not something we will stand idly by and ignore , " european commission trade spokesman peter power told journalists in brussels .
on wednesday , the us house of representatives approved a 622-billion-euro -lrb- $ 819 billion -rrb- stimulus package designed to jolt the country 's economy out of its worst recession since world war ii .
alarm bells are ringing the package calls for investments in infrastructure , renewable energy , health , education and other sectors , together with sweeping tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package calls for investments in infrastructure , like highways but alarm bells have rung in europe over the bill 's plans to extend the so-called " buy american " provision , originally enacted in 1933 , to ban foreign-made iron and steel from most of the new infrastructure projects .
the legislation now moves to the us senate and the " buy american " provisions could yet be scrapped .
but a version of the text due to be discussed by the senate next week goes further , barring all foreign-made goods from being used in all stimulus-funded initiatives .
us president barack obama , who has made the stimulus bill a cornerstone of his economic plans , has not commented specifically on the provisions .
but he has said that its focus must be on creating more than three million jobs in the united states .
still early power said that it was too early for the commission - the eu 's executive - to comment on the act as a whole , since it had not yet become law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us have a string of cases pending at the wto , like the one involving hormone-treated beef " before we have the final shape of that particular bill it would be premature to take a stance on it , " he said .
the us and the eu are one another 's main trading partners , with trade flows topping 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.25 billion -rrb- a day , according to commission figures .
however , they have regularly clashed over questions of trade barriers , with a string of cases pending in the world trade organization on issues ranging from a european ban on hormone-treated beef to us anti-dumping tariffs on french uranium .
according to the commission , the original buy american act affected around 26.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- worth of federal contracts in 2005 . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians have condemned the order . a us general in kabul and a german general overseeing nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- from europe have told nato supreme commander general john craddock of the united states that his order is illegal . craddock had sent a confidential document to nato commanders saying he wanted troops in the 50,000-strong military alliance " to attack directly drug producers and facilities throughout afghanistan . "
the documents told nato troops to use lethal force against opium traders without requiring intelligence data to prove they were passing money to the islamic fundamentalist taliban or in rebellion against the kabul government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general egon ramms -lrb- r -rrb- responded as a " civilian in uniform , " the greens said the web site of the news magazine der spiegel reported that german general egon ramms , who heads a command overseeing isaf from brunssum , the netherlands , and us general david mckiernan , commander of isaf troops in afghanistan , told craddock the order was in breach of their rules of engagement and the laws of armed conflict . nato launches inquiry into leak their stance largely aligns with berlin 's concerns about " mission creep , " a term for isaf taking on new tasks that puts it at odds with ordinary afghans whose goodwill is essential to armed peacekeepers . german military sources in berlin confirmed there was a dispute under way .
on thursday , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer launched an inquiry into the " unacceptable " leaking of confidential military documents on how to deal with afghan drug traders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's supreme commander , general john craddock a nato statement said that craddock was tasked with implementing the pursuit of druglords and laboratories which are generating funds for the taliban , and that he " issued general guidance as a follow-up " so that troops could begin operations . " he has not , and never has , issued illegal orders , " the nato statement said . many german politicians , however , are demanding further explanation . in the friday edition of the berliner zeitung , spd defense spokesman rainer arnold , described craddock 's order as " wrong " and said nato should take a clear position , as otherwise , " farmers in their fields will soon be targeted . " isaf committed to avoiding civilian deaths european mp and cdu defense expert karl von wogau told the paper that craddock 's letter was " an illegal order " that endangered innocent civilians .
and members of the opposition green party have demanded that craddock resign from his post .
general ramms , on the other hand , was praised by the greens for acting as a " citizen in a nato uniform . " der spiegel has also published extracts from a classified response from general mckiernan 's office in kabul that accuses craddock of attempting to " seriously undermine the commitment isaf has made to the afghan people to restrain our use of force and avoid civilian casualties . " german defense minister franz-josef jung has not commented directly on the debate .
his spokesperson said only that this is an internal dispute within nato and that the minister is not going to get involved . a defense ministry spokesman told german news agency dpa that german forces provided logistics and intelligence support to afghan security forces fighting drug gangs , but that german soldiers did not participate in lethal operations which might target drug dealers who were not demonstrably rebels . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the one thing we can be absolutely certain about is that if a bill is passed which prohibits the sale or purchase of european goods on american territory , that is not something we will stand idly by and ignore , " european commission trade spokesman peter power told journalists in brussels .
on wednesday , the us house of representatives approved a 622-billion-euro -lrb- $ 819 billion -rrb- stimulus package designed to jolt the country 's economy out of its worst recession since world war ii .
alarm bells are ringing the package calls for investments in infrastructure , renewable energy , health , education and other sectors , together with sweeping tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package calls for investments in infrastructure , like highways but alarm bells have rung in europe over the bill 's plans to extend the so-called " buy american " provision , originally enacted in 1933 , to ban foreign-made iron and steel from most of the new infrastructure projects .
the legislation now moves to the us senate and the " buy american " provisions could yet be scrapped .
but a version of the text due to be discussed by the senate next week goes further , barring all foreign-made goods from being used in all stimulus-funded initiatives .
us president barack obama , who has made the stimulus bill a cornerstone of his economic plans , has not commented specifically on the provisions .
but he has said that its focus must be on creating more than three million jobs in the united states .
still early power said that it was too early for the commission - the eu 's executive - to comment on the act as a whole , since it had not yet become law .

however , they have regularly clashed over questions of trade barriers , with a string of cases pending in the world trade organization on issues ranging from a european ban on hormone-treated beef to us anti-dumping tariffs on french uranium .

" ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .
the pope 's wish that all may become one - " ut omnes unum sint " - clearly also applies to the reintegration of the pius society .

it is important that we address those issues in a global spirit , " said barroso . the chinese delegation to brussels also signed several agreements with the eu on matters ranging from counterfeiting and piracy to illegal logging , mine safety and civil aviation . summarizing the relations between beijing and brussels , wen said that " all things are moving ahead amid twists and turns . " as part of his european tour , chinese premier 's wen 's visited berlin on the previous day , where he met with german chancellor angela merkel in a joint statement , germany and china said on thursday that they wanted to reform the international financial system and ensure concrete results at a meeting of leaders from the group of 20 nations in april . exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade between germany and china blossomed in 2008 wen also defended the yuan exchange rate as " reasonable and balanced " against us accusations that beijing was manipulating its currency to boost exports and demands that china let the currency appreciate . wen said china 's foreign exchange rate policy stuck " to the principle that it is oriented towards market needs and the exchange rate is flexible or bound to a currency basket . " he acknowledged that global currencies were facing dramatic fluctuations - comparing the ups and downs to a " rollercoaster " - but sharply rejected charges that china was exercising undue influence over exchange rates . " the fault is not with china , " he said . trade between germany and china grew significantly in 2008 and both wen and merkel said there were aiming for least an equal trade volume this year . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i believe that the larger trend of the eu-china relationship can not be reversed , like no one can reverse the trend of history , " chinese premier wen jiabao told reporters on friday during his first visit here in five years . " as long as china and the european union work hand-in-hand , we will be able to overcome the financial crisis and get through the tough times , " he said . the two sides signed nine deals worth close to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- on issues ranging from student exchanges to civil aviation . tensions between the eu and china have risen in recent times , particularly when china cancelled a december summit with the eu following french president nicolas sarkozy 's decision to meet with the dalai lama .

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog welcomed obama 's overtures and called for direct talks without conditions .
" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .

" we had a sense that something extraordinary had happened , but we only really understood the enormity of it later . "
the monday demonstrations proved to be a turning point in the peaceful revolution against the east german rulers , encouraging more protests and hastening the opening of the country .
neumann said the monument was designed to give the non-violent demonstrations in leipzig " an own face " and highlight the civil courage of the citizens of the city in fighting a repressive system .
the german capital too is slated to get its own memorial to commemorate german unity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .
the pope 's wish that all may become one - " ut omnes unum sint " - clearly also applies to the reintegration of the pius society .
but not at any price . clemens finzer covers religion for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , vowed to work together to combat the global financial crisis .
the two agreed to convene an eu-china summit in the near future . following talks in brussels on friday , jan .
30 , it appears that china and the european union have put aside their past differences - especially around tibet - and are moving forward together . " i believe that the larger trend of the eu-china relationship can not be reversed , like no one can reverse the trend of history , " chinese premier wen jiabao told reporters on friday during his first visit here in five years . " as long as china and the european union work hand-in-hand , we will be able to overcome the financial crisis and get through the tough times , " he said . the two sides signed nine deals worth close to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- on issues ranging from student exchanges to civil aviation . tensions between the eu and china have risen in recent times , particularly when china cancelled a december summit with the eu following french president nicolas sarkozy 's decision to meet with the dalai lama .
but after the meeting in brussels , wen and european commission president jose manuel barroso also announced that a china-eu summit would take place soon . " we have decided today we will soon have a new summit between the european union and china , " barroso told a news conference after meeting wen . trade imbalance leads to friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was enraged when sarkozy met with the dalai lama with trade between china and the eu booming in recent years to some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- , officials in brussels warned china about the need to keep markets open .
a trade imbalance with china perpetuated by the fact that europe 's imports from china have grown by about 21 percent for roughly the last five years , has led to frictions . " globally we face an economic crisis without precedent in the postwar era and no one can claim to be completely immune .
it is important that we address those issues in a global spirit , " said barroso . the chinese delegation to brussels also signed several agreements with the eu on matters ranging from counterfeiting and piracy to illegal logging , mine safety and civil aviation . summarizing the relations between beijing and brussels , wen said that " all things are moving ahead amid twists and turns . " as part of his european tour , chinese premier 's wen 's visited berlin on the previous day , where he met with german chancellor angela merkel in a joint statement , germany and china said on thursday that they wanted to reform the international financial system and ensure concrete results at a meeting of leaders from the group of 20 nations in april . exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade between germany and china blossomed in 2008 wen also defended the yuan exchange rate as " reasonable and balanced " against us accusations that beijing was manipulating its currency to boost exports and demands that china let the currency appreciate . wen said china 's foreign exchange rate policy stuck " to the principle that it is oriented towards market needs and the exchange rate is flexible or bound to a currency basket . " he acknowledged that global currencies were facing dramatic fluctuations - comparing the ups and downs to a " rollercoaster " - but sharply rejected charges that china was exercising undue influence over exchange rates . " the fault is not with china , " he said . trade between germany and china grew significantly in 2008 and both wen and merkel said there were aiming for least an equal trade volume this year . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .

erdogan gets hero 's welcome in istanbul on friday , thousands of turks turned out at the airport in istanbul to welcome recep tayyip erdogan returning home from davos .
the crowds waved turkish and palestinian flags and held up banners reading , " welcome back conqueror of davos , " and " world , look at our prime minister . "
many turks are deeply sympathetic to palestinians and the recent israeli military action in the gaza strip prompted scores of large pro-gaza demonstrations in istanbul and ankara .
news agencies have reported that erdogan 's actions are likely to go down well with the electorate ahead of local elections in march .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .
" he addressed me in a style which does not fit in with the free discussion style of davos .
he raised his voice at me , " said erdogan of peres ' manner during the session .
schwab said the incident was " regrettable " and did not fit with the " davos spirit . "
erdogan says rhetoric meant for israeli government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan was treated like a hero by thousands of cheering supporters turkey , a nato member , is one of the few muslim countries to have dealings with israel and the two have enjoyed good relations in recent years .

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .
maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are so strong in your words .
you killed people .
i remember the children who died on beaches , " erdogan said , through an interpreter .
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt , " accusing him of " knowing very well how to kill babies . "
the turkish leader said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud peres for defending israel 's actions .
erdogan then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .

" ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .
the pope 's wish that all may become one - " ut omnes unum sint " - clearly also applies to the reintegration of the pius society .

" ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .

the two agreed to convene an eu-china summit in the near future . following talks in brussels on friday , jan .
30 , it appears that china and the european union have put aside their past differences - especially around tibet - and are moving forward together . " i believe that the larger trend of the eu-china relationship can not be reversed , like no one can reverse the trend of history , " chinese premier wen jiabao told reporters on friday during his first visit here in five years . " as long as china and the european union work hand-in-hand , we will be able to overcome the financial crisis and get through the tough times , " he said . the two sides signed nine deals worth close to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- on issues ranging from student exchanges to civil aviation . tensions between the eu and china have risen in recent times , particularly when china cancelled a december summit with the eu following french president nicolas sarkozy 's decision to meet with the dalai lama .

" we have decided today we will soon have a new summit between the european union and china , " barroso told a news conference after meeting wen . trade imbalance leads to friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was enraged when sarkozy met with the dalai lama with trade between china and the eu booming in recent years to some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- , officials in brussels warned china about the need to keep markets open .
a trade imbalance with china perpetuated by the fact that europe 's imports from china have grown by about 21 percent for roughly the last five years , has led to frictions . " globally we face an economic crisis without precedent in the postwar era and no one can claim to be completely immune .
it is important that we address those issues in a global spirit , " said barroso . the chinese delegation to brussels also signed several agreements with the eu on matters ranging from counterfeiting and piracy to illegal logging , mine safety and civil aviation . summarizing the relations between beijing and brussels , wen said that " all things are moving ahead amid twists and turns . " as part of his european tour , chinese premier 's wen 's visited berlin on the previous day , where he met with german chancellor angela merkel in a joint statement , germany and china said on thursday that they wanted to reform the international financial system and ensure concrete results at a meeting of leaders from the group of 20 nations in april . exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade between germany and china blossomed in 2008 wen also defended the yuan exchange rate as " reasonable and balanced " against us accusations that beijing was manipulating its currency to boost exports and demands that china let the currency appreciate . wen said china 's foreign exchange rate policy stuck " to the principle that it is oriented towards market needs and the exchange rate is flexible or bound to a currency basket . " he acknowledged that global currencies were facing dramatic fluctuations - comparing the ups and downs to a " rollercoaster " - but sharply rejected charges that china was exercising undue influence over exchange rates . " the fault is not with china , " he said . trade between germany and china grew significantly in 2008 and both wen and merkel said there were aiming for least an equal trade volume this year . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , they have regularly clashed over questions of trade barriers , with a string of cases pending in the world trade organization on issues ranging from a european ban on hormone-treated beef to us anti-dumping tariffs on french uranium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : erdogan discredited as mediator after davos row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan 's stormy exit from a panel discussion on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip at the davos summit has discredited him as a mediator in the region , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . recep tayyip erdogan 's performance at the world economic forum in davos has destroyed any hopes that had been pinned on him to act a mediator in the middle east conflict .
erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog welcomed obama 's overtures and called for direct talks without conditions .
" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : erdogan discredited as mediator after davos row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan 's stormy exit from a panel discussion on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip at the davos summit has discredited him as a mediator in the region , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . recep tayyip erdogan 's performance at the world economic forum in davos has destroyed any hopes that had been pinned on him to act a mediator in the middle east conflict .
erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog welcomed obama 's overtures and called for direct talks without conditions .
" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .

" i believe that the larger trend of the eu-china relationship can not be reversed , like no one can reverse the trend of history , " chinese premier wen jiabao told reporters on friday during his first visit here in five years . " as long as china and the european union work hand-in-hand , we will be able to overcome the financial crisis and get through the tough times , " he said . the two sides signed nine deals worth close to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- on issues ranging from student exchanges to civil aviation . tensions between the eu and china have risen in recent times , particularly when china cancelled a december summit with the eu following french president nicolas sarkozy 's decision to meet with the dalai lama .

a trade imbalance with china perpetuated by the fact that europe 's imports from china have grown by about 21 percent for roughly the last five years , has led to frictions . " globally we face an economic crisis without precedent in the postwar era and no one can claim to be completely immune .
it is important that we address those issues in a global spirit , " said barroso . the chinese delegation to brussels also signed several agreements with the eu on matters ranging from counterfeiting and piracy to illegal logging , mine safety and civil aviation . summarizing the relations between beijing and brussels , wen said that " all things are moving ahead amid twists and turns . " as part of his european tour , chinese premier 's wen 's visited berlin on the previous day , where he met with german chancellor angela merkel in a joint statement , germany and china said on thursday that they wanted to reform the international financial system and ensure concrete results at a meeting of leaders from the group of 20 nations in april . exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade between germany and china blossomed in 2008 wen also defended the yuan exchange rate as " reasonable and balanced " against us accusations that beijing was manipulating its currency to boost exports and demands that china let the currency appreciate . wen said china 's foreign exchange rate policy stuck " to the principle that it is oriented towards market needs and the exchange rate is flexible or bound to a currency basket . " he acknowledged that global currencies were facing dramatic fluctuations - comparing the ups and downs to a " rollercoaster " - but sharply rejected charges that china was exercising undue influence over exchange rates . " the fault is not with china , " he said . trade between germany and china grew significantly in 2008 and both wen and merkel said there were aiming for least an equal trade volume this year . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .

but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .

10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .

german politicians have condemned the order . a us general in kabul and a german general overseeing nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- from europe have told nato supreme commander general john craddock of the united states that his order is illegal . craddock had sent a confidential document to nato commanders saying he wanted troops in the 50,000-strong military alliance " to attack directly drug producers and facilities throughout afghanistan . "
the documents told nato troops to use lethal force against opium traders without requiring intelligence data to prove they were passing money to the islamic fundamentalist taliban or in rebellion against the kabul government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general egon ramms -lrb- r -rrb- responded as a " civilian in uniform , " the greens said the web site of the news magazine der spiegel reported that german general egon ramms , who heads a command overseeing isaf from brunssum , the netherlands , and us general david mckiernan , commander of isaf troops in afghanistan , told craddock the order was in breach of their rules of engagement and the laws of armed conflict . nato launches inquiry into leak their stance largely aligns with berlin 's concerns about " mission creep , " a term for isaf taking on new tasks that puts it at odds with ordinary afghans whose goodwill is essential to armed peacekeepers . german military sources in berlin confirmed there was a dispute under way .
on thursday , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer launched an inquiry into the " unacceptable " leaking of confidential military documents on how to deal with afghan drug traders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's supreme commander , general john craddock a nato statement said that craddock was tasked with implementing the pursuit of druglords and laboratories which are generating funds for the taliban , and that he " issued general guidance as a follow-up " so that troops could begin operations . " he has not , and never has , issued illegal orders , " the nato statement said . many german politicians , however , are demanding further explanation . in the friday edition of the berliner zeitung , spd defense spokesman rainer arnold , described craddock 's order as " wrong " and said nato should take a clear position , as otherwise , " farmers in their fields will soon be targeted . " isaf committed to avoiding civilian deaths european mp and cdu defense expert karl von wogau told the paper that craddock 's letter was " an illegal order " that endangered innocent civilians .
and members of the opposition green party have demanded that craddock resign from his post .
general ramms , on the other hand , was praised by the greens for acting as a " citizen in a nato uniform . " der spiegel has also published extracts from a classified response from general mckiernan 's office in kabul that accuses craddock of attempting to " seriously undermine the commitment isaf has made to the afghan people to restrain our use of force and avoid civilian casualties . " german defense minister franz-josef jung has not commented directly on the debate .
his spokesperson said only that this is an internal dispute within nato and that the minister is not going to get involved . a defense ministry spokesman told german news agency dpa that german forces provided logistics and intelligence support to afghan security forces fighting drug gangs , but that german soldiers did not participate in lethal operations which might target drug dealers who were not demonstrably rebels . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the one thing we can be absolutely certain about is that if a bill is passed which prohibits the sale or purchase of european goods on american territory , that is not something we will stand idly by and ignore , " european commission trade spokesman peter power told journalists in brussels .
on wednesday , the us house of representatives approved a 622-billion-euro -lrb- $ 819 billion -rrb- stimulus package designed to jolt the country 's economy out of its worst recession since world war ii .
alarm bells are ringing the package calls for investments in infrastructure , renewable energy , health , education and other sectors , together with sweeping tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package calls for investments in infrastructure , like highways but alarm bells have rung in europe over the bill 's plans to extend the so-called " buy american " provision , originally enacted in 1933 , to ban foreign-made iron and steel from most of the new infrastructure projects .
the legislation now moves to the us senate and the " buy american " provisions could yet be scrapped .
but a version of the text due to be discussed by the senate next week goes further , barring all foreign-made goods from being used in all stimulus-funded initiatives .
us president barack obama , who has made the stimulus bill a cornerstone of his economic plans , has not commented specifically on the provisions .
but he has said that its focus must be on creating more than three million jobs in the united states .
still early power said that it was too early for the commission - the eu 's executive - to comment on the act as a whole , since it had not yet become law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us have a string of cases pending at the wto , like the one involving hormone-treated beef " before we have the final shape of that particular bill it would be premature to take a stance on it , " he said .
the us and the eu are one another 's main trading partners , with trade flows topping 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.25 billion -rrb- a day , according to commission figures .
however , they have regularly clashed over questions of trade barriers , with a string of cases pending in the world trade organization on issues ranging from a european ban on hormone-treated beef to us anti-dumping tariffs on french uranium .
according to the commission , the original buy american act affected around 26.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- worth of federal contracts in 2005 . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the one thing we can be absolutely certain about is that if a bill is passed which prohibits the sale or purchase of european goods on american territory , that is not something we will stand idly by and ignore , " european commission trade spokesman peter power told journalists in brussels .
on wednesday , the us house of representatives approved a 622-billion-euro -lrb- $ 819 billion -rrb- stimulus package designed to jolt the country 's economy out of its worst recession since world war ii .
alarm bells are ringing the package calls for investments in infrastructure , renewable energy , health , education and other sectors , together with sweeping tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package calls for investments in infrastructure , like highways but alarm bells have rung in europe over the bill 's plans to extend the so-called " buy american " provision , originally enacted in 1933 , to ban foreign-made iron and steel from most of the new infrastructure projects .
the legislation now moves to the us senate and the " buy american " provisions could yet be scrapped .
but a version of the text due to be discussed by the senate next week goes further , barring all foreign-made goods from being used in all stimulus-funded initiatives .
us president barack obama , who has made the stimulus bill a cornerstone of his economic plans , has not commented specifically on the provisions .
but he has said that its focus must be on creating more than three million jobs in the united states .
still early power said that it was too early for the commission - the eu 's executive - to comment on the act as a whole , since it had not yet become law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us have a string of cases pending at the wto , like the one involving hormone-treated beef " before we have the final shape of that particular bill it would be premature to take a stance on it , " he said .
the us and the eu are one another 's main trading partners , with trade flows topping 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.25 billion -rrb- a day , according to commission figures .
however , they have regularly clashed over questions of trade barriers , with a string of cases pending in the world trade organization on issues ranging from a european ban on hormone-treated beef to us anti-dumping tariffs on french uranium .
according to the commission , the original buy american act affected around 26.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- worth of federal contracts in 2005 . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog welcomed obama 's overtures and called for direct talks without conditions .
" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .

" we want to take shared responsibility to honor the outstanding contribution of the citizens of east germany in the peaceful revolution of 1989 , " neumann said after the meeting in berlin .
the federal government will put up five million euros -lrb- $ 6.58 million -rrb- to fund the memorial , the minister said .
the decision to build a unity monument in the eastern german city follows years of controversy .
in 2007 , when the german parliament agreed to erect a monument in berlin to remember the country 's fraught cold war divisions and celebrate the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , about 70 parliamentarians revolted and insisted on building a second monument in leipzig .
at the time , neumann rejected the initiative .
leipzig at the vanguard of peaceful revolution leipzig 's role in helping bring down the east german communist regime is well-documented .
the so-called " monday demonstrations " saw some 70,000 people take to the streets on oct 9 , 1989 with the famous chants of " we are the people . "
in an interview with deutsche welle earlier this month , christian fuehrer , pastor of the nikolai church in leipzig and a leading figure in the monday demonstrations , remembered the extraordinary night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian fuehrer say the enormity of the monday demonstrations only sank in later " everyone was holding a candle , a symbol of non-violence - you need to hold a candle with both hands to keep it from going out , which makes it impossible to throw stones , " fueher said .
" we had a sense that something extraordinary had happened , but we only really understood the enormity of it later . "
the monday demonstrations proved to be a turning point in the peaceful revolution against the east german rulers , encouraging more protests and hastening the opening of the country .
neumann said the monument was designed to give the non-violent demonstrations in leipzig " an own face " and highlight the civil courage of the citizens of the city in fighting a repressive system .
the german capital too is slated to get its own memorial to commemorate german unity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to take shared responsibility to honor the outstanding contribution of the citizens of east germany in the peaceful revolution of 1989 , " neumann said after the meeting in berlin .
the federal government will put up five million euros -lrb- $ 6.58 million -rrb- to fund the memorial , the minister said .
the decision to build a unity monument in the eastern german city follows years of controversy .
in 2007 , when the german parliament agreed to erect a monument in berlin to remember the country 's fraught cold war divisions and celebrate the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , about 70 parliamentarians revolted and insisted on building a second monument in leipzig .
at the time , neumann rejected the initiative .
leipzig at the vanguard of peaceful revolution leipzig 's role in helping bring down the east german communist regime is well-documented .
the so-called " monday demonstrations " saw some 70,000 people take to the streets on oct 9 , 1989 with the famous chants of " we are the people . "
in an interview with deutsche welle earlier this month , christian fuehrer , pastor of the nikolai church in leipzig and a leading figure in the monday demonstrations , remembered the extraordinary night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian fuehrer say the enormity of the monday demonstrations only sank in later " everyone was holding a candle , a symbol of non-violence - you need to hold a candle with both hands to keep it from going out , which makes it impossible to throw stones , " fueher said .
" we had a sense that something extraordinary had happened , but we only really understood the enormity of it later . "
the monday demonstrations proved to be a turning point in the peaceful revolution against the east german rulers , encouraging more protests and hastening the opening of the country .
neumann said the monument was designed to give the non-violent demonstrations in leipzig " an own face " and highlight the civil courage of the citizens of the city in fighting a repressive system .
the german capital too is slated to get its own memorial to commemorate german unity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .

10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .

certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to take shared responsibility to honor the outstanding contribution of the citizens of east germany in the peaceful revolution of 1989 , " neumann said after the meeting in berlin .
the federal government will put up five million euros -lrb- $ 6.58 million -rrb- to fund the memorial , the minister said .
the decision to build a unity monument in the eastern german city follows years of controversy .
in 2007 , when the german parliament agreed to erect a monument in berlin to remember the country 's fraught cold war divisions and celebrate the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , about 70 parliamentarians revolted and insisted on building a second monument in leipzig .
at the time , neumann rejected the initiative .
leipzig at the vanguard of peaceful revolution leipzig 's role in helping bring down the east german communist regime is well-documented .
the so-called " monday demonstrations " saw some 70,000 people take to the streets on oct 9 , 1989 with the famous chants of " we are the people . "
in an interview with deutsche welle earlier this month , christian fuehrer , pastor of the nikolai church in leipzig and a leading figure in the monday demonstrations , remembered the extraordinary night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian fuehrer say the enormity of the monday demonstrations only sank in later " everyone was holding a candle , a symbol of non-violence - you need to hold a candle with both hands to keep it from going out , which makes it impossible to throw stones , " fueher said .
" we had a sense that something extraordinary had happened , but we only really understood the enormity of it later . "
the monday demonstrations proved to be a turning point in the peaceful revolution against the east german rulers , encouraging more protests and hastening the opening of the country .
neumann said the monument was designed to give the non-violent demonstrations in leipzig " an own face " and highlight the civil courage of the citizens of the city in fighting a repressive system .
the german capital too is slated to get its own memorial to commemorate german unity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .
maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are so strong in your words .
you killed people .
i remember the children who died on beaches , " erdogan said , through an interpreter .
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt , " accusing him of " knowing very well how to kill babies . "
the turkish leader said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud peres for defending israel 's actions .
erdogan then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .
erdogan gets hero 's welcome in istanbul on friday , thousands of turks turned out at the airport in istanbul to welcome recep tayyip erdogan returning home from davos .
the crowds waved turkish and palestinian flags and held up banners reading , " welcome back conqueror of davos , " and " world , look at our prime minister . "
many turks are deeply sympathetic to palestinians and the recent israeli military action in the gaza strip prompted scores of large pro-gaza demonstrations in istanbul and ankara .
news agencies have reported that erdogan 's actions are likely to go down well with the electorate ahead of local elections in march .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .
" he addressed me in a style which does not fit in with the free discussion style of davos .
he raised his voice at me , " said erdogan of peres ' manner during the session .
schwab said the incident was " regrettable " and did not fit with the " davos spirit . "
erdogan says rhetoric meant for israeli government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan was treated like a hero by thousands of cheering supporters turkey , a nato member , is one of the few muslim countries to have dealings with israel and the two have enjoyed good relations in recent years .
but erdogan has been a staunch critic of israel 's actions in gaza .
speaking to the crowds in istanbul on friday , erdogan said that " our hard words are not directed towards the people of israel , not directed at the jews , but they are totally directed towards the government of israel " .
some 1,300 palestinians were killed during the israeli offensive in the gaza strip , along with 13 israelis . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the one thing we can be absolutely certain about is that if a bill is passed which prohibits the sale or purchase of european goods on american territory , that is not something we will stand idly by and ignore , " european commission trade spokesman peter power told journalists in brussels .
on wednesday , the us house of representatives approved a 622-billion-euro -lrb- $ 819 billion -rrb- stimulus package designed to jolt the country 's economy out of its worst recession since world war ii .
alarm bells are ringing the package calls for investments in infrastructure , renewable energy , health , education and other sectors , together with sweeping tax cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the package calls for investments in infrastructure , like highways but alarm bells have rung in europe over the bill 's plans to extend the so-called " buy american " provision , originally enacted in 1933 , to ban foreign-made iron and steel from most of the new infrastructure projects .
the legislation now moves to the us senate and the " buy american " provisions could yet be scrapped .
but a version of the text due to be discussed by the senate next week goes further , barring all foreign-made goods from being used in all stimulus-funded initiatives .
us president barack obama , who has made the stimulus bill a cornerstone of his economic plans , has not commented specifically on the provisions .
but he has said that its focus must be on creating more than three million jobs in the united states .
still early power said that it was too early for the commission - the eu 's executive - to comment on the act as a whole , since it had not yet become law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu and us have a string of cases pending at the wto , like the one involving hormone-treated beef " before we have the final shape of that particular bill it would be premature to take a stance on it , " he said .
the us and the eu are one another 's main trading partners , with trade flows topping 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.25 billion -rrb- a day , according to commission figures .
however , they have regularly clashed over questions of trade barriers , with a string of cases pending in the world trade organization on issues ranging from a european ban on hormone-treated beef to us anti-dumping tariffs on french uranium .
according to the commission , the original buy american act affected around 26.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- worth of federal contracts in 2005 . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but an essential prerequisite is missing . iceland enjoys full access to the eu 's internal market through the european free trade association and the european economic area , and also complies with most eu laws , officials said . " this means that it would have a lot less homework to do than other applicants from eastern europe .
its membership bid would be faster , " krisztina nagy , spokeswoman of eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . however , nagy would not confirm reports in friday 's guardian that iceland could join the eu as soon as 2011 , saying : " the first precondition is that they apply . " rehn , who comes from finland , was quoted by the british daily as saying that iceland is " one of the oldest democracies in the world . "
" its strategic and economic positions would be an asset to the eu , " rehn said . croatia also vying for eu membership but he also stressed that the eu normally prefers to have more than one applicant join the bloc at any one time , meaning iceland 's entry could be linked to croatia 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's prime minister geir haarde stepped down as the country 's government collapsed croatia , which submitted its application for eu membership in 2003 , wants to finalize negotiations by the end of this year .
but talks with brussels have been slowed down by a border dispute with neighboring slovenia . iceland 's conservative independence party , whose government collapsed this week , has traditionally opposed eu membership .
but observers in reykjavik say it has softened its stance in the wake of the global financial crisis , which pushed the nation of 300,000 inhabitants on the brink of economic ruin . pro-eu campaigners argue that membership of the bloc , and eventually of the euro area , would provide the island with much needed stability . the social democrats , who are in favour of eu membership , are currently in talks to form an interim government with the left-green movement , which opposes membership and is riding high in opinion polls ahead of a snap general election likely to take place in may . fishing ban could pose obstacle officials in brussels note that the biggest stumbling bloc to iceland 's eu membership - besides the fact that the country has not applied for membership yet - concerns the fisheries sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland might have to give up whale hunting if it wants to be part of the eu other eu member states are likely to insist that iceland stick to the eu 's fishing quotas and the bloc 's ban on whale hunting – two issues likely to create resentment among the local population . any transitional arrangements on such issues would be " part of the negotiation process , " nagy said . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .
maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are so strong in your words .
you killed people .
i remember the children who died on beaches , " erdogan said , through an interpreter .
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt , " accusing him of " knowing very well how to kill babies . "
the turkish leader said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud peres for defending israel 's actions .
erdogan then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .
erdogan gets hero 's welcome in istanbul on friday , thousands of turks turned out at the airport in istanbul to welcome recep tayyip erdogan returning home from davos .
the crowds waved turkish and palestinian flags and held up banners reading , " welcome back conqueror of davos , " and " world , look at our prime minister . "
many turks are deeply sympathetic to palestinians and the recent israeli military action in the gaza strip prompted scores of large pro-gaza demonstrations in istanbul and ankara .
news agencies have reported that erdogan 's actions are likely to go down well with the electorate ahead of local elections in march .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .
" he addressed me in a style which does not fit in with the free discussion style of davos .
he raised his voice at me , " said erdogan of peres ' manner during the session .
schwab said the incident was " regrettable " and did not fit with the " davos spirit . "
erdogan says rhetoric meant for israeli government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan was treated like a hero by thousands of cheering supporters turkey , a nato member , is one of the few muslim countries to have dealings with israel and the two have enjoyed good relations in recent years .

speaking to the crowds in istanbul on friday , erdogan said that " our hard words are not directed towards the people of israel , not directed at the jews , but they are totally directed towards the government of israel " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : erdogan discredited as mediator after davos row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan 's stormy exit from a panel discussion on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip at the davos summit has discredited him as a mediator in the region , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . recep tayyip erdogan 's performance at the world economic forum in davos has destroyed any hopes that had been pinned on him to act a mediator in the middle east conflict .
erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : erdogan discredited as mediator after davos row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan 's stormy exit from a panel discussion on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip at the davos summit has discredited him as a mediator in the region , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . recep tayyip erdogan 's performance at the world economic forum in davos has destroyed any hopes that had been pinned on him to act a mediator in the middle east conflict .
erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : the pope 's high price for reintegration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current scandal over pope benedict 's decision to rehabilitate a holocaust denier into the church shows that the price for catholic unity might be too high to pay , says dw 's clemens finzer . " ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .

it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .

france pushes ahead with plans for a new reactor . on friday , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that while public opinion limits the use of nuclear energy in the european bloc , he is determined to push it as far as possible . " i am ready to go as far as we can go in the union , " he said at a conference in the czech city of ostrava .
" i am personally supporting nuclear energy as an important part of the eu energy mix , " he added during the conference on energy security in europe . nuclear energy faces strong opposition in some eu countries , such as austria .
germany is home to strong anti-nuclear sentiment , although that has been changing as concerns increase about a reliance on foreign energy suppliers and desire grows for cleaner forms of energy production . france does not fall into the group of countries strongly opposed to nuclear energy .
the country has 58 nuclear reactors , which provide approximately 80 percent of its electricity . french president nicolas sarkozy announced late on thursday , jan .
28 , that french energy supplier edf will build the country 's second next-generation epr nuclear reactor at penly , on the english channel , according to the online edition of the daily le figaro .
construction is slated to begin in 2011 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has called sarkozy 's decision " entirely illegitimate " the announcement was met with anger from the environmental group greenpeace , which called the decision " entirely illegitimate and dangerous . " " this decision was taken without any public consultation , open bidding or analysis of energy needs .
it has no justification other than to provide a massive contract to the state-owned nuclear industry , which has a poor safety and environmental record , " said jan beranek , greenpeace 's international energy campaigner . however , as europe emerges from a gas crisis caused by a row between ukraine and russia that cut off supplies in the middle of winter , nuclear energy is being reconsidered by some . number of reactors set to increase czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , also underlined the value of nuclear energy . " do we want to have sustainable energy with low emissions ? " he asked , adding that nuclear energy was the only way to achieve that goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants from the 60s and 70s are shutting down france is n't the only country set to build an epr reactor .
finland is also constructing a facility and china is slated to build two . nuclear power plants currently produce around a third of the eu 's electricity and around 15 percent of its total energy , but that statistic is dwindling as plants built in the 1960s and 1970s come to the end of their lives . france and germany have developed an as yet untested third-generation pressurized water reactor , and eu energy commissioner piebalgs announced that a nuclear energy forum to discuss new investments in the field would take place in prague this spring . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .

german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .

in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : erdogan discredited as mediator after davos row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan 's stormy exit from a panel discussion on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip at the davos summit has discredited him as a mediator in the region , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . recep tayyip erdogan 's performance at the world economic forum in davos has destroyed any hopes that had been pinned on him to act a mediator in the middle east conflict .
erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

france pushes ahead with plans for a new reactor . on friday , eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said that while public opinion limits the use of nuclear energy in the european bloc , he is determined to push it as far as possible . " i am ready to go as far as we can go in the union , " he said at a conference in the czech city of ostrava .
" i am personally supporting nuclear energy as an important part of the eu energy mix , " he added during the conference on energy security in europe . nuclear energy faces strong opposition in some eu countries , such as austria .
germany is home to strong anti-nuclear sentiment , although that has been changing as concerns increase about a reliance on foreign energy suppliers and desire grows for cleaner forms of energy production . france does not fall into the group of countries strongly opposed to nuclear energy .
the country has 58 nuclear reactors , which provide approximately 80 percent of its electricity . french president nicolas sarkozy announced late on thursday , jan .
28 , that french energy supplier edf will build the country 's second next-generation epr nuclear reactor at penly , on the english channel , according to the online edition of the daily le figaro .
construction is slated to begin in 2011 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has called sarkozy 's decision " entirely illegitimate " the announcement was met with anger from the environmental group greenpeace , which called the decision " entirely illegitimate and dangerous . " " this decision was taken without any public consultation , open bidding or analysis of energy needs .
it has no justification other than to provide a massive contract to the state-owned nuclear industry , which has a poor safety and environmental record , " said jan beranek , greenpeace 's international energy campaigner . however , as europe emerges from a gas crisis caused by a row between ukraine and russia that cut off supplies in the middle of winter , nuclear energy is being reconsidered by some . number of reactors set to increase czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , also underlined the value of nuclear energy . " do we want to have sustainable energy with low emissions ? " he asked , adding that nuclear energy was the only way to achieve that goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants from the 60s and 70s are shutting down france is n't the only country set to build an epr reactor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 30.01.2009 top la curator breaks the east-west divide in german art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ar penck 's ' passage ' is one of the works in the show ; click on the gallery below for more cold war art from both east and west germany is the focus of a new exhibition at the los angeles county museum of art , which has already received considerable attention .
dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world spoke with curator stephanie barron . the exhibition " art of two germanys / cold war cultures " runs through april 19 , 2009 at the los angeles county museum of art -lrb- lacma -rrb- .
it will then travel to germany , where it will be shown at the germanisches nationalmuseum in nuremberg -lrb- may 23-sept .
6 , 2009 -rrb- and the deutsches historisches museum in berlin -lrb- oct .
3-jan .
10 , 2010 -rrb- . click on the picture gallery below to see some of the works from the exhibition . dw-world : what is the exhibition 's aim ? stephanie barron : the purpose of the exhibition is really to look freshly with a distance of twenty years and of being outside germany at the remarkable range of art created during the cold war in both germanys . we want to look freshly at some of the more familiar ideas about how art has been characterized from this period .
it 's been primarily characterized by painting - which is one reason why the exhibition also has so many examples of sculpture , photography , installation , video , documentation of performance and artists ' books . we also try to examine the notion that so much of post-war german art is really expressionist in nature .
by looking at multiple threads , i think we make that argument .
we also wanted to look closely at works by both east and west german artists together , wherever possible in the same room , and not try to isolate them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron has been a curator at lacma since 1976 it sounds like you 're interested in changing the way people think about art from the cold war period . i think we are , though i do n't think this is necessarily what we started out to do .
it 's the result of good investigation .
coming at this project as someone in the united states , i don ’ t bring the same baggage that i would if i were a curator in germany - for better or for worse . i was happy to be able to work with german colleagues on the exhibition .
but keeping in mind how this was going to work for a us audience was always very important .
i think i was n't burdened by many of the expectations that -lrb- germans -rrb- would have coming to the exhibition . what are those expectations ? i 'll give you an example .
when we install an exhibition , every work of art has a label .
it says the artist 's name , where they were born , where they died , or where they lived and where they were active .
in essence , you have to read the labels to find out who is east and who is west . for many in our audience , who are equally unfamiliar with konrad lueg or -lrb- eugen -rrb- schoeneberg as they are with -lrb- werner -rrb- tuebke or -lrb- willi -rrb- sitte they come freshly looking at it as art - not with any preconceptions about east as one thing and west as something else .
i find that very liberating and very fresh . the exhibition is going to germany , where it will actually spend more time than in california .
do you think it will be more challenging there with a german audience ? i do n't know .
one of the things i 've noticed over 30 years of doing exhibitions and traveling quite a bit in germany is that the demographics in germany have changed .
i wonder if people coming to an exhibition like this , depending on their generation , bring the same expectations or the same baggage to it .
but i would suspect that a younger generation - people in their twenties - might look differently at this show than people in their sixties . artistically speaking , can we talk about a " unified " germany , even 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall ? this exhibition ends in 1989 and i do n't think it 's appropriate in the context of this one to make sweeping observations about the post-wall period . but i do think that we try to challenge the preconceptions .
the second room of the exhibition brings together on one wall examples of socialist realism from the 1950s , while on another wall there 's informal and abstraction - -lrb- emil -rrb- schumacher , ko goetz .
and yet right in the middle is a large table filled with these marvelous , small cultural exercises by hermann gloeckner from dresden , who totally confounds any expectations or stereotypes . so i think we 've tried to find artists who are not necessarily always the most expected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barron says she enjoys the works of hermann gloeckner do you think that , based on this exhibition which ends with 1989 , conclusions can be made about the relationship between art and politics in general ? i think that it 's hard to look at german art of the 20th century and not think about the intersections with politics .
certainly , art of the 90s - internationally - is just a much more global experience . when i go to berlin now , i can just as easily meet someone from london as from los angeles or budapest or berlin or hamburg .
it 's a much more international situation , particularly in berlin .
i find that very exciting , but i think the " germanness " has become less identifiable than perhaps it was 25 years ago . how did your personal interest in german art develop ? as an undergraduate and graduate student , i studied french art , like most art historians in the united states .
at columbia university , when i was there , we still had the last gasp of the emigres , but i was studying french and contemporary art . when i moved to los angeles in the mid-1970s , i found that there was this great library of german expressionism and a great print and book collection here .
being away from new york , before the getty was available with its great library , being able to do original resource in la was an opportunity i did n't want to pass up .
it was also a topic that had n't been as well mined by others . do you have a favorite piece that you stop and look at each time you walk through the exhibition ? when i walk through and see the works of hermann gloeckner , i have to say that i still get a chill .
i remember seeing the archives in dresden and being shown these works and thinking , these are absolutely amazing - i really wanted to show these and bring them to los angeles . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , the us house of representatives approved a 622-billion-euro -lrb- $ 819 billion -rrb- stimulus package designed to jolt the country 's economy out of its worst recession since world war ii .

german politicians have condemned the order . a us general in kabul and a german general overseeing nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- from europe have told nato supreme commander general john craddock of the united states that his order is illegal . craddock had sent a confidential document to nato commanders saying he wanted troops in the 50,000-strong military alliance " to attack directly drug producers and facilities throughout afghanistan . "
the documents told nato troops to use lethal force against opium traders without requiring intelligence data to prove they were passing money to the islamic fundamentalist taliban or in rebellion against the kabul government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general egon ramms -lrb- r -rrb- responded as a " civilian in uniform , " the greens said the web site of the news magazine der spiegel reported that german general egon ramms , who heads a command overseeing isaf from brunssum , the netherlands , and us general david mckiernan , commander of isaf troops in afghanistan , told craddock the order was in breach of their rules of engagement and the laws of armed conflict . nato launches inquiry into leak their stance largely aligns with berlin 's concerns about " mission creep , " a term for isaf taking on new tasks that puts it at odds with ordinary afghans whose goodwill is essential to armed peacekeepers . german military sources in berlin confirmed there was a dispute under way .
on thursday , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer launched an inquiry into the " unacceptable " leaking of confidential military documents on how to deal with afghan drug traders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's supreme commander , general john craddock a nato statement said that craddock was tasked with implementing the pursuit of druglords and laboratories which are generating funds for the taliban , and that he " issued general guidance as a follow-up " so that troops could begin operations . " he has not , and never has , issued illegal orders , " the nato statement said . many german politicians , however , are demanding further explanation . in the friday edition of the berliner zeitung , spd defense spokesman rainer arnold , described craddock 's order as " wrong " and said nato should take a clear position , as otherwise , " farmers in their fields will soon be targeted . " isaf committed to avoiding civilian deaths european mp and cdu defense expert karl von wogau told the paper that craddock 's letter was " an illegal order " that endangered innocent civilians .
and members of the opposition green party have demanded that craddock resign from his post .
general ramms , on the other hand , was praised by the greens for acting as a " citizen in a nato uniform . " der spiegel has also published extracts from a classified response from general mckiernan 's office in kabul that accuses craddock of attempting to " seriously undermine the commitment isaf has made to the afghan people to restrain our use of force and avoid civilian casualties . " german defense minister franz-josef jung has not commented directly on the debate .
his spokesperson said only that this is an internal dispute within nato and that the minister is not going to get involved . a defense ministry spokesman told german news agency dpa that german forces provided logistics and intelligence support to afghan security forces fighting drug gangs , but that german soldiers did not participate in lethal operations which might target drug dealers who were not demonstrably rebels . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two agreed to convene an eu-china summit in the near future . following talks in brussels on friday , jan .
30 , it appears that china and the european union have put aside their past differences - especially around tibet - and are moving forward together . " i believe that the larger trend of the eu-china relationship can not be reversed , like no one can reverse the trend of history , " chinese premier wen jiabao told reporters on friday during his first visit here in five years . " as long as china and the european union work hand-in-hand , we will be able to overcome the financial crisis and get through the tough times , " he said . the two sides signed nine deals worth close to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- on issues ranging from student exchanges to civil aviation . tensions between the eu and china have risen in recent times , particularly when china cancelled a december summit with the eu following french president nicolas sarkozy 's decision to meet with the dalai lama .
but after the meeting in brussels , wen and european commission president jose manuel barroso also announced that a china-eu summit would take place soon . " we have decided today we will soon have a new summit between the european union and china , " barroso told a news conference after meeting wen . trade imbalance leads to friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was enraged when sarkozy met with the dalai lama with trade between china and the eu booming in recent years to some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- , officials in brussels warned china about the need to keep markets open .
a trade imbalance with china perpetuated by the fact that europe 's imports from china have grown by about 21 percent for roughly the last five years , has led to frictions . " globally we face an economic crisis without precedent in the postwar era and no one can claim to be completely immune .
it is important that we address those issues in a global spirit , " said barroso . the chinese delegation to brussels also signed several agreements with the eu on matters ranging from counterfeiting and piracy to illegal logging , mine safety and civil aviation . summarizing the relations between beijing and brussels , wen said that " all things are moving ahead amid twists and turns . " as part of his european tour , chinese premier 's wen 's visited berlin on the previous day , where he met with german chancellor angela merkel in a joint statement , germany and china said on thursday that they wanted to reform the international financial system and ensure concrete results at a meeting of leaders from the group of 20 nations in april . exchange rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trade between germany and china blossomed in 2008 wen also defended the yuan exchange rate as " reasonable and balanced " against us accusations that beijing was manipulating its currency to boost exports and demands that china let the currency appreciate . wen said china 's foreign exchange rate policy stuck " to the principle that it is oriented towards market needs and the exchange rate is flexible or bound to a currency basket . " he acknowledged that global currencies were facing dramatic fluctuations - comparing the ups and downs to a " rollercoaster " - but sharply rejected charges that china was exercising undue influence over exchange rates . " the fault is not with china , " he said . trade between germany and china grew significantly in 2008 and both wen and merkel said there were aiming for least an equal trade volume this year . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a trade imbalance with china perpetuated by the fact that europe 's imports from china have grown by about 21 percent for roughly the last five years , has led to frictions . " globally we face an economic crisis without precedent in the postwar era and no one can claim to be completely immune .
it is important that we address those issues in a global spirit , " said barroso . the chinese delegation to brussels also signed several agreements with the eu on matters ranging from counterfeiting and piracy to illegal logging , mine safety and civil aviation . summarizing the relations between beijing and brussels , wen said that " all things are moving ahead amid twists and turns .

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .

the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .

on friday , peres said he talked with erdogan afterward the row and said : " my respect for him did n't change . " during the debate on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip on thursday , peres made an impassioned defense of israel 's actions , raising his voice and jabbing his finger .
peres , who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts in the 1990s to reach a deal with the palestine liberation organization , questioned what erdogan would do if rockets were fired at istanbul every night .
a visibly angry erdogan responded strongly to peres ' repeated question to the panel of what they would do in israel 's position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan storms past peres and un chief ban ki-moon " president peres you are older than i am .
maybe you are feeling guilty and that is why you are so strong in your words .
you killed people .
i remember the children who died on beaches , " erdogan said , through an interpreter .
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt , " accusing him of " knowing very well how to kill babies . "
the turkish leader said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud peres for defending israel 's actions .
erdogan then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .
erdogan gets hero 's welcome in istanbul on friday , thousands of turks turned out at the airport in istanbul to welcome recep tayyip erdogan returning home from davos .
the crowds waved turkish and palestinian flags and held up banners reading , " welcome back conqueror of davos , " and " world , look at our prime minister . "
many turks are deeply sympathetic to palestinians and the recent israeli military action in the gaza strip prompted scores of large pro-gaza demonstrations in istanbul and ankara .
news agencies have reported that erdogan 's actions are likely to go down well with the electorate ahead of local elections in march .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
at a press conference about an hour later with the davos summit founder klaus schwab , erdogan said he was upset because of the moderation style of david ignatius from the washington post newspaper .
the turkish leader said peres was given 25 minutes to speak , more than twice the amount of time given to himself and moussa , who was cut off by the moderator after 12 minutes .
" he addressed me in a style which does not fit in with the free discussion style of davos .
he raised his voice at me , " said erdogan of peres ' manner during the session .

" ut omnes unum sint " - so that all may be one - but at what price ?
it seemed as if pope benedict xvi had chosen a good moment to extend his hand to the society of saint pius x. it would have been hard to find a more symbolic time than the week of prayer for christian unity .
but benedict neglected to note the spirit of the society and its followers . leading sspx brothers have clearly distanced themselves from the remarks of bishop richard williamson , who denied the existence of gas chambers and reduced the number of jews killed by the nazis from six million to 300,000 .
but just last year , williamson was a well-regarded guest of sspx brothers and frequently visited their congregations and their training center in the central bavarian town of zaitzkofen .
he ordained priests , confirmed believers all over germany and published articles in the congregation 's monthly magazine .
it 's hard to believe church officials when they now claim that they did n't know about this man 's convictions . one can guess that it was known to an extent that makes people uncomfortable now .
sspx brothers basically have the same , anti-semitic view .
on the society 's web site one can read sentences such as : " now the vatican is frantically looking for solutions to kow-tow in front of the mighty jewish power centers that even force popes on their knees . " again and again , the society has emphasized that jews could n't possibly be the " older brothers in faith . "
referring to the crucifixion of jesus christ , society followers say that " they are guilty of deicide as long as they do not distance themselves from the guilt of their forefathers by acknowledging christ 's divinity and getting baptized . "
as long as rome continues to stick to dialog and reconciliation with other religions , a rapprochement is impossible , they say .
the pope is very well aware of this opposition to the core messages of the second vatican council . where to go from here ?
the followers of the sspx brothers show no remorse and do n't really seem to be ready to reintegrate ; instead , they even issue demands .
during his general audience on wednesday , benedict might have called on the followers of the pius society to follow his sign of reconciliation with the necessary steps on their side .
but the pope is bound to have to wait a very long time for that to happen . anyone who has preached and lived a partially inhumane doctrine for the past 20 years will not come around in a day .
the pope 's wish that all may become one - " ut omnes unum sint " - clearly also applies to the reintegration of the pius society .

the two agreed to convene an eu-china summit in the near future . following talks in brussels on friday , jan .
30 , it appears that china and the european union have put aside their past differences - especially around tibet - and are moving forward together . " i believe that the larger trend of the eu-china relationship can not be reversed , like no one can reverse the trend of history , " chinese premier wen jiabao told reporters on friday during his first visit here in five years . " as long as china and the european union work hand-in-hand , we will be able to overcome the financial crisis and get through the tough times , " he said . the two sides signed nine deals worth close to 60 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- on issues ranging from student exchanges to civil aviation . tensions between the eu and china have risen in recent times , particularly when china cancelled a december summit with the eu following french president nicolas sarkozy 's decision to meet with the dalai lama .
but after the meeting in brussels , wen and european commission president jose manuel barroso also announced that a china-eu summit would take place soon . " we have decided today we will soon have a new summit between the european union and china , " barroso told a news conference after meeting wen . trade imbalance leads to friction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china was enraged when sarkozy met with the dalai lama with trade between china and the eu booming in recent years to some 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 384 billion -rrb- , officials in brussels warned china about the need to keep markets open .

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .

" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .

" it is good that obama extended his hand and showed willingness to hold direct talks with iran , " the german foreign minister said .
" that 's why i 'm calling on the iranians to be sensible and be open to the us offer . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says accepting obama 's offer is in iran 's own interest it should be done for the people in iran who " are suffering from the isolation and confrontation resulting from the policies of tehran and many are also going hungry , " steinmeier added .
germany to scale back trade with iran his comments came as a german official confirmed on friday that senior diplomats from six world powers trying to persuade tehran to halt its nuclear program would meet in berlin next week .
german foreign ministry official jens ploetner said that diplomats from the un security council 's permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany will meet on wednesday near the western city of frankfurt .
the six countries have offered tehran a set of economic and energy incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program which the west suspects is being used as a cover to develop nuclear weapons .
germany said this week it had drastically cut its export guarantees for companies trading with iran .
berlin 's move came amid increased criticism , notably from the united states and israel , over germany 's growing trade with iran .
german exports to iran rose 10.5 percent in the first 11 months of 2008 to reach 3.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- , according to government statistics .
us-iran talks " long overdue " next wednesday 's meeting in berlin of the six world powers on the iranian nuclear program will mark the first gathering since barack obama took office on january 20 .
in one of the biggest foreign policy reversals since taking the reins , obama this week told arab broadcaster al-arabiya he was willing to talk directly with iran and map out a new future for us relations with iran after a three-decade diplomatic freeze .
washington is also at odds with iran over its threats to destroy israel as well as tehran 's support of the militant groups hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in the palestinian territories .
the us broke off diplomatic relations with iran after hard-line students stormed the us embassy in tehran in 1979 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and meant to generate electricity at the same time , obama 's administration has refused to rule out any options - including military strikes - if tehran refuses to abandon its uranium enrichment program .
the head of the un nuclear watchdog welcomed obama 's overtures and called for direct talks without conditions .
" it is the way to go .
it is long overdue , " mohamed elbaradei , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said on thursday on the sidelines of the davos summit .
" the security issue will not be resolved without direct dialogue between iran and the us . "
on thursday , iran , which insists its nuclear program is peaceful and solely geared toward electricity generation , promised a positive response if the united states makes genuine policy changes .
but earlier this week , iran 's hard-line president mahmoud ahmadinejad demanded obama apologize for past us " crimes " against the islamic republic . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.01.2009 opinion : erdogan discredited as mediator after davos row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan 's stormy exit from a panel discussion on the israeli offensive in the gaza strip at the davos summit has discredited him as a mediator in the region , says deutsche welle 's baha güngör . recep tayyip erdogan 's performance at the world economic forum in davos has destroyed any hopes that had been pinned on him to act a mediator in the middle east conflict .
erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

erdogan was seated next to israeli president shimon peres , un secretary-general ban ki-moon and arab league secretary general amr mussa .
the topic of the panel discussion moderated by washington post columnist david ignatius was the recent war in gaza .
erdogan enjoyed special attention during the debate because turkey has been a member of the nato since 1952 , has wanted to join the european union for decades and has recently been highly praised for its efforts to mediate between syria and israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baha güngör the moderator of the panel discussion is to be largely blamed for the spat because he gave mussa and erdogan only 12 minutes each to speak while peres had 25 minutes to air his views .
peres ' emotional and partly vociferous defense of his country 's brutal war against the palestinians - which was conducted without consideration towards the civilian population , international aid groups on the ground or the united nations - raised erdogan 's hackles .
his reaction may have been appropriate and even justified .
peres provided him with the right to counter by asking what turkey would have done if rockets had landed in istanbul .
but erdogan struck a wrong note and went too far in his response .
his anger rose as the moderator attempted to end the discussion in order to stick to the time limit and get out in time for dinner .
erdogan has opened himself to accusations that he used the occasion for a show of populism in order to strengthen his religious-conservative akp party 's fortunes in local elections on march 29 , despite the fact that a victory is already a foregone conclusion .
a spontaneous demonstration by more than 5,000 supporters waving turkish and palestinian flags welcoming erdogan upon his arrived in istanbul shows that such tactics go down well with his compatriots .
but his verbal attacks against peres and the moderator as well as his announcement to skip davos next year show that erdogan ca n't be taken seriously as a mideast mediator anymore .
the turkish prime minister is naturally upset that his israeli counterpart ehud olmert lied when asked in ankara a day before the israeli offensive began whether israel would attack gaza .
at the time , olmert clearly said " no . "
still , erdogan should have shown more diplomatic tact .
he 's the leader of a large country which is an important player regarding regional peace .
erdogan is not going to earn respect or prizes as a peacemaker and mediator on the world stage if he acts like a center-forward from a istanbul district football team - which he once was .
erdogan 's attempts to reiterate his friendship with israel and the jewish people after the spat can no longer limit the damage done to his image and to turkey 's .

but an essential prerequisite is missing . iceland enjoys full access to the eu 's internal market through the european free trade association and the european economic area , and also complies with most eu laws , officials said . " this means that it would have a lot less homework to do than other applicants from eastern europe .
its membership bid would be faster , " krisztina nagy , spokeswoman of eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . however , nagy would not confirm reports in friday 's guardian that iceland could join the eu as soon as 2011 , saying : " the first precondition is that they apply . " rehn , who comes from finland , was quoted by the british daily as saying that iceland is " one of the oldest democracies in the world . "
" its strategic and economic positions would be an asset to the eu , " rehn said . croatia also vying for eu membership but he also stressed that the eu normally prefers to have more than one applicant join the bloc at any one time , meaning iceland 's entry could be linked to croatia 's . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's prime minister geir haarde stepped down as the country 's government collapsed croatia , which submitted its application for eu membership in 2003 , wants to finalize negotiations by the end of this year .
but talks with brussels have been slowed down by a border dispute with neighboring slovenia . iceland 's conservative independence party , whose government collapsed this week , has traditionally opposed eu membership .
but observers in reykjavik say it has softened its stance in the wake of the global financial crisis , which pushed the nation of 300,000 inhabitants on the brink of economic ruin . pro-eu campaigners argue that membership of the bloc , and eventually of the euro area , would provide the island with much needed stability . the social democrats , who are in favour of eu membership , are currently in talks to form an interim government with the left-green movement , which opposes membership and is riding high in opinion polls ahead of a snap general election likely to take place in may . fishing ban could pose obstacle officials in brussels note that the biggest stumbling bloc to iceland 's eu membership - besides the fact that the country has not applied for membership yet - concerns the fisheries sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland might have to give up whale hunting if it wants to be part of the eu other eu member states are likely to insist that iceland stick to the eu 's fishing quotas and the bloc 's ban on whale hunting – two issues likely to create resentment among the local population . any transitional arrangements on such issues would be " part of the negotiation process , " nagy said . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to take shared responsibility to honor the outstanding contribution of the citizens of east germany in the peaceful revolution of 1989 , " neumann said after the meeting in berlin .
the federal government will put up five million euros -lrb- $ 6.58 million -rrb- to fund the memorial , the minister said .
the decision to build a unity monument in the eastern german city follows years of controversy .
in 2007 , when the german parliament agreed to erect a monument in berlin to remember the country 's fraught cold war divisions and celebrate the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , about 70 parliamentarians revolted and insisted on building a second monument in leipzig .
at the time , neumann rejected the initiative .
leipzig at the vanguard of peaceful revolution leipzig 's role in helping bring down the east german communist regime is well-documented .
the so-called " monday demonstrations " saw some 70,000 people take to the streets on oct 9 , 1989 with the famous chants of " we are the people . "
in an interview with deutsche welle earlier this month , christian fuehrer , pastor of the nikolai church in leipzig and a leading figure in the monday demonstrations , remembered the extraordinary night .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian fuehrer say the enormity of the monday demonstrations only sank in later " everyone was holding a candle , a symbol of non-violence - you need to hold a candle with both hands to keep it from going out , which makes it impossible to throw stones , " fueher said .
" we had a sense that something extraordinary had happened , but we only really understood the enormity of it later . "
the monday demonstrations proved to be a turning point in the peaceful revolution against the east german rulers , encouraging more protests and hastening the opening of the country .
neumann said the monument was designed to give the non-violent demonstrations in leipzig " an own face " and highlight the civil courage of the citizens of the city in fighting a repressive system .
the german capital too is slated to get its own memorial to commemorate german unity . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

recep tayyip erdogan had reacted angrily when he was refused the chance to respond to israeli president shimon peres ' defence of the operation thousands of people turned out in the city to greet mr erdogan 's plane .
he told them mr peres ' language and tone had been unacceptable , so he acted to stand up for turkish honour .
" i only know that i have to protect the honour of turkey and turkish people , " said mr erdogan .
" i am not a chief of a tribe .
i am the prime minister of turkey .
i have to do what i have to do . "
the bbc 's sarah rainsford in istanbul said there had been huge anger in turkey at israel 's operation in gaza and there now appears to be widespread support for mr erdogan 's actions in davos . "
this showed that turks are standing on their feet in europe , in the world " mustafa mastar , istanbul resident turkey rallies to gaza 's plight huge crowds were waiting at istanbul airport in the early hours of the morning , with many people waving turkish and palestinian flags .
correspondents said the crowds were shouting " turkey is with you , " and that some were holding signs greeting mr erdogan as " a new world leader " .
" in davos , all the world witnessed what has not been happening for many years , " said istanbul resident mustafa mastar .
" this showed the power of turks .
it showed that turks are standing on their feet in europe , in the world . "
" tonight i was really proud .
i feel really happy , " said mustafa sahin , another person in the crowd .
' matter closed ' during the debate on thursday , mr erdogan had clashed with mr peres , whose voice had risen as he made an impassioned defence of israel 's actions , jabbing his finger .
mr erdogan said mr peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt " .
he said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud mr peres for defending israel 's actions .
he then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with mr peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .
he said he respected mr peres but that " what he says is not true " .
turkey is one of the few muslim countries to have dealings with israel , but relations have been under strain since the islamist-rooted ak party was elected to power in 2002 .
but mr erdogan stressed to the crowds in istanbul that " our hard words are not directed towards the people of israel , not directed at the jews , but they are totally directed towards the government of israel " .
he said no decision on turkish-israeli relations would be made " driven by momentary anger on such issues " .
more than 1,300 palestinians and 14 israelis were killed during the three-week conflict in gaza , which began on 27 december .
thank you for all your comments on this issue - we 're unable to publish them all but here is a broad cross-section of some of the remarks you 've sent us .
i watched the debate myself .
i have to say the moderation was poor , and it was true that erdogan was not given the chance to respond .
moreover moderator behaved inapproriately towards the prime minister .
erdogan did the right thing genc , istanbul it is interesting that the turkish prime minister is so concerned for human rights of the palestinians and yet look at what turkey does to the kurds .
and let 's not get started on the armenians .
michael julian , london this has been another clear example of erdogan 's hypocrisy .
it was only last year when erdogan was welcoming omar al-bashir , sudan 's president to istanbul who has been accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in darfur .
if you disagree with killing of innocent people it should be on all grounds , not only for certain groups .
engin turan , london , uk first and foremost , i do not support israel 's actions in gaza , nor should any sane human being .
i think the turkish prime minister 's action and his comments are commendable to say the least .
i have never respected any prime minister or leader as much as i now respect him .
he has proven that world leaders can defend justice .
his people 's welcome is a god given sign of god ' blessing of his action .
tina saad , al-ain , uae why should erdogan be " hailed " ?
his actions showed an immaturity and a lack of ability to convey his thoughts .
this is not the leadership qualities one would expect from a person in his position .
sam , usa erdogan is certainly not regarded as a hero in turkey .
it 's true that for some turks , the palestine-israel conflict is almost like a matter of pride , they always react more on this issue than say muslims dying in iraq or sudan .
erdogan just exploits these feelings before the elections .
this is a guy who says " rage is a type of rhetoric " and insults everyone from farmers to ambassadors in turkey too .
usa and eu supported him so far , in the benefit of their companies exploiting resources of turkey .
to me , this is a story of erdogan ’ s hypocrisy against the western hypocrisy in the middle east .
ozge , lancaster i believe it is unfair that the moderator did n't give turkey pm enough time to respond to president peres 's speech .
the washington post moderator reason came out as though dinner is much more important than what these people are in davos for .
is it really dinner that these politicians , world leaders and business leaders fly to davos for every year ?
someone has to explain this to the rest of the world .
these people care less about the real world problems and a lot more about their stomach and face time .
this is quite sad .
no wonder we have so many problems in the world .
talking through tough issues , and finding friendly ways to solving them take the back seat .
dinner takes the front seat .
it is really , really sad . - ed , sf , usa one of the fundamental principles of debate is that both sides get a fair chance to present their arguments .
too often the media -lrb- including the bbc -rrb- fail in this when it comes to the palestinian / israeli issues .
erdogan did the right thing and i hope this highlights the lack of impartialty on their part due to the overbearing influence of israel over the media .
irshad akhtar , london , uk i support israel now more than ever .
the israeli government has the right to defend its people .

advertisement signs in the crowd greeted mr erdogan as ' a new world leader ' turkey 's pm has received a hero 's welcome on his return to istanbul after he stormed out of a debate about gaza at the world economic forum in davos .
recep tayyip erdogan had reacted angrily when he was refused the chance to respond to israeli president shimon peres ' defence of the operation thousands of people turned out in the city to greet mr erdogan 's plane .
he told them mr peres ' language and tone had been unacceptable , so he acted to stand up for turkish honour .
" i only know that i have to protect the honour of turkey and turkish people , " said mr erdogan .
" i am not a chief of a tribe .
i am the prime minister of turkey .
i have to do what i have to do . "
the bbc 's sarah rainsford in istanbul said there had been huge anger in turkey at israel 's operation in gaza and there now appears to be widespread support for mr erdogan 's actions in davos .
this showed that turks are standing on their feet in europe , in the world mustafa mastar , istanbul resident turkey rallies to gaza 's plight huge crowds were waiting at istanbul airport in the early hours of the morning , with many people waving turkish and palestinian flags .
correspondents said the crowds were shouting " turkey is with you , " and that some were holding signs greeting mr erdogan as " a new world leader " .
" in davos , all the world witnessed what has not been happening for many years , " said istanbul resident mustafa mastar .
" this showed the power of turks .
it showed that turks are standing on their feet in europe , in the world . "
" tonight i was really proud .
i feel really happy , " said mustafa sahin , another person in the crowd .
' matter closed ' crowds gathered at istanbul airport to welcome mr erdogan during the debate on thursday , mr erdogan had clashed with mr peres , whose voice had risen as he made an impassioned defence of israel 's actions , jabbing his finger .
mr erdogan said mr peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt " .
he said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud mr peres for defending israel 's actions .
he then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with mr peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .

advertisement turkey pm storms off in gaza row he said he respected mr peres but that " what he says is not true " .
turkey is one of the few muslim countries to have dealings with israel , but relations have been under strain since the islamist-rooted ak party was elected to power in 2002 .
but mr erdogan stressed to the crowds in istanbul that " our hard words are not directed towards the people of israel , not directed at the jews , but they are totally directed towards the government of israel " .
he said no decision on turkish-israeli relations would be made " driven by momentary anger on such issues " .
more than 1,300 palestinians and 14 israelis were killed during the three-week conflict in gaza , which began on 27 december .
thank you for all your comments on this issue - we 're unable to publish them all but here is a broad cross-section of some of the remarks you 've sent us .
i watched the debate myself .
i have to say the moderation was poor , and it was true that erdogan was not given the chance to respond .
moreover moderator behaved inapproriately towards the prime minister .
erdogan did the right thing genc , istanbul it is interesting that the turkish prime minister is so concerned for human rights of the palestinians and yet look at what turkey does to the kurds .
and let 's not get started on the armenians .
michael julian , london this has been another clear example of erdogan 's hypocrisy .
it was only last year when erdogan was welcoming omar al-bashir , sudan 's president to istanbul who has been accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in darfur .
if you disagree with killing of innocent people it should be on all grounds , not only for certain groups .
engin turan , london , uk first and foremost , i do not support israel 's actions in gaza , nor should any sane human being .
i think the turkish prime minister 's action and his comments are commendable to say the least .
i have never respected any prime minister or leader as much as i now respect him .
he has proven that world leaders can defend justice .
his people 's welcome is a god given sign of god ' blessing of his action .
tina saad , al-ain , uae why should erdogan be " hailed " ?
his actions showed an immaturity and a lack of ability to convey his thoughts .
this is not the leadership qualities one would expect from a person in his position .
sam , usa erdogan is certainly not regarded as a hero in turkey .
it 's true that for some turks , the palestine-israel conflict is almost like a matter of pride , they always react more on this issue than say muslims dying in iraq or sudan .
erdogan just exploits these feelings before the elections .
this is a guy who says " rage is a type of rhetoric " and insults everyone from farmers to ambassadors in turkey too .
usa and eu supported him so far , in the benefit of their companies exploiting resources of turkey .
to me , this is a story of erdogan ’ s hypocrisy against the western hypocrisy in the middle east .
ozge , lancaster i believe it is unfair that the moderator did n't give turkey pm enough time to respond to president peres 's speech .
the washington post moderator reason came out as though dinner is much more important than what these people are in davos for .
is it really dinner that these politicians , world leaders and business leaders fly to davos for every year ?
someone has to explain this to the rest of the world .
these people care less about the real world problems and a lot more about their stomach and face time .
this is quite sad .
no wonder we have so many problems in the world .
talking through tough issues , and finding friendly ways to solving them take the back seat .
dinner takes the front seat .
it is really , really sad . - ed , sf , usa one of the fundamental principles of debate is that both sides get a fair chance to present their arguments .
too often the media -lrb- including the bbc -rrb- fail in this when it comes to the palestinian / israeli issues .
erdogan did the right thing and i hope this highlights the lack of impartialty on their part due to the overbearing influence of israel over the media .

advertisement signs in the crowd greeted mr erdogan as ' a new world leader ' turkey 's pm has received a hero 's welcome on his return to istanbul after he stormed out of a debate about gaza at the world economic forum in davos .
recep tayyip erdogan had reacted angrily when he was refused the chance to respond to israeli president shimon peres ' defence of the operation thousands of people turned out in the city to greet mr erdogan 's plane .
he told them mr peres ' language and tone had been unacceptable , so he acted to stand up for turkish honour .
" i only know that i have to protect the honour of turkey and turkish people , " said mr erdogan .
" i am not a chief of a tribe .
i am the prime minister of turkey .
i have to do what i have to do . "
the bbc 's sarah rainsford in istanbul said there had been huge anger in turkey at israel 's operation in gaza and there now appears to be widespread support for mr erdogan 's actions in davos .
this showed that turks are standing on their feet in europe , in the world mustafa mastar , istanbul resident turkey rallies to gaza 's plight huge crowds were waiting at istanbul airport in the early hours of the morning , with many people waving turkish and palestinian flags .
correspondents said the crowds were shouting " turkey is with you , " and that some were holding signs greeting mr erdogan as " a new world leader " .
" in davos , all the world witnessed what has not been happening for many years , " said istanbul resident mustafa mastar .
" this showed the power of turks .
it showed that turks are standing on their feet in europe , in the world . "
" tonight i was really proud .
i feel really happy , " said mustafa sahin , another person in the crowd .
' matter closed ' crowds gathered at istanbul airport to welcome mr erdogan during the debate on thursday , mr erdogan had clashed with mr peres , whose voice had risen as he made an impassioned defence of israel 's actions , jabbing his finger .
mr erdogan said mr peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his " guilt " .
he said many people had died in gaza and he found it sad that anyone would applaud mr peres for defending israel 's actions .
he then accused the moderator of not allowing him to speak and said he did not think he would return to davos .
the turkish pm stressed later that he had left the debate not because of his disagreements with mr peres but because he had been given much less time to speak than the israeli leader .

advertisement turkey pm storms off in gaza row he said he respected mr peres but that " what he says is not true " .
turkey is one of the few muslim countries to have dealings with israel , but relations have been under strain since the islamist-rooted ak party was elected to power in 2002 .
but mr erdogan stressed to the crowds in istanbul that " our hard words are not directed towards the people of israel , not directed at the jews , but they are totally directed towards the government of israel " .
he said no decision on turkish-israeli relations would be made " driven by momentary anger on such issues " .
more than 1,300 palestinians and 14 israelis were killed during the three-week conflict in gaza , which began on 27 december .
thank you for all your comments on this issue - we 're unable to publish them all but here is a broad cross-section of some of the remarks you 've sent us .
i watched the debate myself .
i have to say the moderation was poor , and it was true that erdogan was not given the chance to respond .
moreover moderator behaved inapproriately towards the prime minister .
erdogan did the right thing genc , istanbul it is interesting that the turkish prime minister is so concerned for human rights of the palestinians and yet look at what turkey does to the kurds .
and let 's not get started on the armenians .
michael julian , london this has been another clear example of erdogan 's hypocrisy .
it was only last year when erdogan was welcoming omar al-bashir , sudan 's president to istanbul who has been accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes in darfur .
if you disagree with killing of innocent people it should be on all grounds , not only for certain groups .
engin turan , london , uk first and foremost , i do not support israel 's actions in gaza , nor should any sane human being .
i think the turkish prime minister 's action and his comments are commendable to say the least .
i have never respected any prime minister or leader as much as i now respect him .
he has proven that world leaders can defend justice .
his people 's welcome is a god given sign of god ' blessing of his action .
tina saad , al-ain , uae why should erdogan be " hailed " ?
his actions showed an immaturity and a lack of ability to convey his thoughts .
this is not the leadership qualities one would expect from a person in his position .
sam , usa erdogan is certainly not regarded as a hero in turkey .
it 's true that for some turks , the palestine-israel conflict is almost like a matter of pride , they always react more on this issue than say muslims dying in iraq or sudan .
erdogan just exploits these feelings before the elections .
this is a guy who says " rage is a type of rhetoric " and insults everyone from farmers to ambassadors in turkey too .
usa and eu supported him so far , in the benefit of their companies exploiting resources of turkey .
to me , this is a story of erdogan ’ s hypocrisy against the western hypocrisy in the middle east .
ozge , lancaster i believe it is unfair that the moderator did n't give turkey pm enough time to respond to president peres 's speech .
the washington post moderator reason came out as though dinner is much more important than what these people are in davos for .
is it really dinner that these politicians , world leaders and business leaders fly to davos for every year ?
someone has to explain this to the rest of the world .
these people care less about the real world problems and a lot more about their stomach and face time .
this is quite sad .
no wonder we have so many problems in the world .
talking through tough issues , and finding friendly ways to solving them take the back seat .
dinner takes the front seat .
it is really , really sad . - ed , sf , usa one of the fundamental principles of debate is that both sides get a fair chance to present their arguments .
too often the media -lrb- including the bbc -rrb- fail in this when it comes to the palestinian / israeli issues .
erdogan did the right thing and i hope this highlights the lack of impartialty on their part due to the overbearing influence of israel over the media .
irshad akhtar , london , uk i support israel now more than ever .
the israeli government has the right to defend its people .

bottom -lrb- l-r -rrb- angela burns , jenny randerson women ams ' making a difference ' the almost equal gender balance of ams in the welsh assembly has transformed how politics in wales is conducted , according to a new report .
the study showed there were more female voices at the assembly than at westminster and in many welsh councils .
political debates were more consensual than adversarial as a result and had ' non-traditional ' topics on the agenda such as domestic violence .
since may 2007 , 47 % of ams are women .
at westminster 19.5 % of mps are women .
the report by swansea and warwick universities argues other legislatures should learn from the welsh assembly .
in the first welsh assembly , elected in 1999 , 40 % of the seats were held by women .
in 2003 , this rose to 50 % .
the report 's lead researcher professor nickie charles from the university of warwick 's department of sociology said this gender balance had an effect on the style of interactions between politicians , both cross-party and within party . "
we have fierce disagreement in group meetings but it is conducted with the complete absence of chest thumping and table thumping " anonymous male labour am " according to many ams , women tend to do politics differently from men and this is often described as being more consensual than adversarial , " she said .
" the assembly is a new political institution associated with a consensual political style , an inclusive politics , and working arrangements which recognise the caring responsibilities of those working within it . "
the report quotes an anonymous male labour am who says : " it makes a difference to the culture in which group meetings are conducted , as i 've said we have fierce disagreement in group meetings but it is conducted with the complete absence of chest thumping and table thumping . "
the ams interviewed as part of the research agreed that women had an impact on the type of policy issues that were debated .
more emphasis was given to what one am referred to as " non-traditional areas " .
they said : " domestic violence is on the agenda , equal pay is on the agenda and all those kinds of really important issues that probably would n't be there if there was n't such a high number of women . "
researcher charlotte aull davies from swansea university said : " the culture , the way debates are conducted , the language used and the policies that are prioritised are linked , by almost all ams , both to the gender balance of the assembly and to the fact that it is a new institution . "
however , the report noted that the position in welsh local government contrasted poorly . "
there was a view among councillors that the culture of local government was male dominated and that that in order to fit into it women had to behave like men " anonymous female am after the 2004 local elections the proportion of women councillors in wales was 22 % .
since the 2008 elections it has increased to 25 % but this all-wales figure hides considerable local variation .
at the time the research was conducted , cardiff had 37 % women councillors , swansea 31 % and the vale of glamorgan 30 % while blaenau gwent had 9.5 % , anglesey 5 % and merthyr tydfil 3 % .
according to ams interviewed by researchers , the culture of local government also contrasts with that of the welsh assembly .
one woman am , who was a member of a council in the south wales valleys , said : " it was largely made up of older men who felt that the place for a woman was in the home , and also that they had a right to run everything locally .
" there was a view among councillors that the culture of local government was male dominated and that that in order to fit into it women had to behave like men . "
the welsh local government association said : " only a quarter of councillors in wales are women and this reflects the fact that only a quarter of candidates who stand for election are women .
" although there are a large number of independent councillors in wales , political parties have a key role in terms of selecting candidates and the encouragement of more women , younger people and ethnic minority candidates .
" ultimately , however , the responsibility lies with individual members of the public to consider standing to serve their communities . "
she added that the wlga and local councils work to encourage people from under represented groups to stand as councillors .
the researchers will present the findings of their study to a conference of politicians and researchers at swansea 's liberty stadium on friday .

bottom -lrb- l-r -rrb- angela burns , jenny randerson women ams ' making a difference ' the almost equal gender balance of ams in the welsh assembly has transformed how politics in wales is conducted , according to a new report .
the study showed there were more female voices at the assembly than at westminster and in many welsh councils .
political debates were more consensual than adversarial as a result and had ' non-traditional ' topics on the agenda such as domestic violence .
since may 2007 , 47 % of ams are women .
at westminster 19.5 % of mps are women .
the report by swansea and warwick universities argues other legislatures should learn from the welsh assembly .
in the first welsh assembly , elected in 1999 , 40 % of the seats were held by women .
in 2003 , this rose to 50 % .
the report 's lead researcher professor nickie charles from the university of warwick 's department of sociology said this gender balance had an effect on the style of interactions between politicians , both cross-party and within party .
we have fierce disagreement in group meetings but it is conducted with the complete absence of chest thumping and table thumping anonymous male labour am " according to many ams , women tend to do politics differently from men and this is often described as being more consensual than adversarial , " she said .
" the assembly is a new political institution associated with a consensual political style , an inclusive politics , and working arrangements which recognise the caring responsibilities of those working within it . "
the report quotes an anonymous male labour am who says : " it makes a difference to the culture in which group meetings are conducted , as i 've said we have fierce disagreement in group meetings but it is conducted with the complete absence of chest thumping and table thumping . "
the ams interviewed as part of the research agreed that women had an impact on the type of policy issues that were debated .
more emphasis was given to what one am referred to as " non-traditional areas " .
they said : " domestic violence is on the agenda , equal pay is on the agenda and all those kinds of really important issues that probably would n't be there if there was n't such a high number of women . "
researcher charlotte aull davies from swansea university said : " the culture , the way debates are conducted , the language used and the policies that are prioritised are linked , by almost all ams , both to the gender balance of the assembly and to the fact that it is a new institution . "
however , the report noted that the position in welsh local government contrasted poorly .
there was a view among councillors that the culture of local government was male dominated and that that in order to fit into it women had to behave like men anonymous female am after the 2004 local elections the proportion of women councillors in wales was 22 % .
since the 2008 elections it has increased to 25 % but this all-wales figure hides considerable local variation .

it comes after a report by swansea and warwick universities said that almost equal gender balance of ams in the welsh assembly has transformed how politics in wales is conducted .
ms jones said there were two reasons why women were needed in politics .
first of all for democracy to work it needs to represent the community it serves .
half of the population is female and yet this is not always reflected in democratically elected bodies .
the second reason is that women have a different experience of life .
we tend to have a different experience when it comes to family life and we need a balance of all these different experiences .
the experiences that women have brought to the assembly have made a difference in terms of the work that has been prioritised .
one of the first things the assembly did was to create a children 's commissioner for wales .
other nations followed our example .
and it 's not just that we have women working as assembly members , it 's that we have women who believe in the principles of feminism .
having enough women in politics can change what is done and how it is done helen mary jones am to become successful it is our job to bring in other women .
the most famous ever female politician was margaret thatcher but she was no help to other women in her party or in politics in general .
she was a woman who operated like a man .
there were no women in her cabinet and no competition .
but in the two terms of the assembly the cross party connections have been strong and opposite numbers have worked closely together .
when sue essex was the environment minister and janet davies was shadow environment minister they worked well together because they had gone to greenham common together .
' consultation ' while i was the shadow health minister , i worked closely with jane hutt , who was the health minister at the time , on developing the children 's commissioner for wales role .
because of my experience and expertise , she asked me to do a consultation .
i can not imagine that happening in westminster between ministers and shadow ministers .
she knew i would not hijack the issue for party political purposes and i knew i would not be taken advantage of .
we ended up with a very strong children 's commissioner which has become a model for others .
having enough women in politics can change what is done and how it is done .
but despite the work of women in the assembly , it 's important we do n't get complacent .
if we look at other areas like business and local government , women are still severely under represented .
we have still got a long way to go .

it comes after a report by swansea and warwick universities said that almost equal gender balance of ams in the welsh assembly has transformed how politics in wales is conducted .
ms jones said there were two reasons why women were needed in politics .
first of all for democracy to work it needs to represent the community it serves .
half of the population is female and yet this is not always reflected in democratically elected bodies .
the second reason is that women have a different experience of life .
we tend to have a different experience when it comes to family life and we need a balance of all these different experiences .
the experiences that women have brought to the assembly have made a difference in terms of the work that has been prioritised .
one of the first things the assembly did was to create a children 's commissioner for wales .
other nations followed our example .
and it 's not just that we have women working as assembly members , it 's that we have women who believe in the principles of feminism .
having enough women in politics can change what is done and how it is done helen mary jones am to become successful it is our job to bring in other women .
the most famous ever female politician was margaret thatcher but she was no help to other women in her party or in politics in general .
she was a woman who operated like a man .
there were no women in her cabinet and no competition .
but in the two terms of the assembly the cross party connections have been strong and opposite numbers have worked closely together .
when sue essex was the environment minister and janet davies was shadow environment minister they worked well together because they had gone to greenham common together .
' consultation ' while i was the shadow health minister , i worked closely with jane hutt , who was the health minister at the time , on developing the children 's commissioner for wales role .
because of my experience and expertise , she asked me to do a consultation .
i can not imagine that happening in westminster between ministers and shadow ministers .
she knew i would not hijack the issue for party political purposes and i knew i would not be taken advantage of .
we ended up with a very strong children 's commissioner which has become a model for others .
having enough women in politics can change what is done and how it is done .
but despite the work of women in the assembly , it 's important we do n't get complacent .
if we look at other areas like business and local government , women are still severely under represented .
we have still got a long way to go .

pakistan 's high commissioner in britain , wajid shamsul hasan , told indian media islamabad 's own report on the attacks would be released soon .
more than 170 people were killed when 10 gunmen attacked india 's financial capital in november .
india says pakistan-based militant group lashkar-e-taiba was to blame .
india has also suggested what it calls " state elements " were involved .
both pakistan and lashkar-e-taiba have denied any involvement .
the attacks have put relations between india and pakistan under severe strain .
' no whitewash ' mr hasan 's comments to india 's ndtv channel are thought to be the first official words on what the pakistani document might contain .
he said : " pakistani territory was not used so far as the investigators have made their conclusions .
it could have been some other place .
not the uk as well .
because these were the two places i was concerned about . "
" when you collect material , then you sort it out , you re-do it and re-read it .
that requires time " wajid shamsul hasan india and the international community have put huge pressure on pakistan to take action against militants based on its soil and to bring the perpetrators of the mumbai attacks to justice .
pakistan says that it has arrested dozens of people in a crackdown on groups allegedly linked to mumbai .
it says it has also shut a number of operations run by a charity linked to lashkar-e-taiba .
mr hasan added : " we are not going to do any whitewashing business .
we believe in going after facts .
our findings will be acceptable to the world .
we will try to satisfy india with our findings .
we are addressing the concerns of the world not just india . "
he also defended the time it had taken for the report to come out .
" when you collect material , then you sort it out , you re-do it and re-read it .
that requires time , so i am sure once they complete it , they will come out with concrete facts that will satisfy the world as to pakistan 's non-involvement in the mumbai attacks . "
mr hasan also criticised india 's delay in handing over evidence , suggesting its dossier could be " fabricated " .
" you -lsb- india -rsb- took 45 days to come up with a sort of evidence although you started blaming pakistan on the first day " .
the evidence india is said to have handed over includes the interrogation of the surviving gunman , mohammed ajmal amir qasab , details of phone conversations between the attackers and weapons information .
india says all 10 gunmen were from lashkar-e-taiba .
pakistan has admitted qasab is a pakistani citizen .

it says that while progress has been made in tackling domestic abuse , it is lacking in other forms of violence against women , including rape .
more emphasis should be placed on preventative measures and the report calls on the assembly government to take a strategic approach to the issue .
the assembly government said progress had been made in the areas highlighted .
the map of gaps 2 report was compiled by the equality and human rights commission -lrb- ehrc -rrb- and the end violence against women coalition -lrb- evaw -rrb- and is a follow up to the first report in 2007 which identified areas of concern and suggested improvements .
its findings point to a lack of services for women who choose , or feel unable , to report incidents of violence or abuse to the police .
this is because many of the new services are linked to the criminal justice system , said the report .
map of gaps 2 report findings one rape crisis centre in wales compared to 13 in scotland there are five statutory funded sexual assault referral centres in wales eighteen local authorities in wales do not have a specialised voluntary sexual violence service there is only one prostitution , trafficking and sexual exploitation service in wales which is in cardiff source : map of gaps 2 report to accompany the report , a map of gaps interactive website that allows people to see what services are available in their area , has been launched .
the website has a function that enables members of the public to contact their local authority , constituency and regional ams , and mps in order to ask them to take action to improve provision in their area .
the ehrc and evaw want to see the assembly government build on the progress made in tackling domestic abuse by taking a strategic approach to tackling all forms of violence and abuse towards women .
they are also calling for local authorities and other relevant public bodies to give increased priority to tackling all forms of violence and abuse towards women .
kate bennett from the ehrc in wales said the interactive map revealed some worrying findings about the differences in services in wales and throughout britain .
she also called on the assembly government and local authorities to ensure women had access to the services they needed .
welsh services - 2007 and 2009 compared number of violence against women support service : 2007 - 52 , 2009 - 60 domestic violence services : 2007 - 38 , 2009 - 38 specialist domestic violence courts : 2007 - 8 , 2009 - 11 rape crisis centre : 2007 - 1 , 2009 - 1 sexual assault referral centre : 2007 - 3 , 2009 - 5 source : map of gaps 2 report " we know that the best way forward is the setting of strategic priorities and the long-term funding of projects , " she said .
" we need to see more work being done to prevent instances of violence and abuse .
we know that a great deal of violence towards women is not reported to the police .
" by making people aware of the horrors faced by women that experience violence , we go some way towards making all people realise it can not be tolerated in any shape or form . "
paula hardy , chief executive of welsh women 's aid , which is a member of the evaw coalition , said : " map of gaps 2 demonstrates that recent investment has been linked to the criminal justice system .
" whilst this is welcomed , it is clear that women need both specialist voluntary services as well as statutory services .
" both types of service provision are important as they meet the different needs of women who have suffered violence and are important components of the full collection of support that victims require . "
a welsh assembly government spokesman said it was pleased the report recognised the progress in wales in tackling domestic abuse .
" in some of the areas highlighted in the report , progress has already been made , " he added .
" for example , we now fund four services for women from ethnic minorities in swansea , cardiff , newport and wrexham , not two as mentioned in the report .
" there are also six sexual assault referral centres in wales including one in north wales .
" we are currently developing a new strategic action plan to enhance the delivery of our national domestic abuse strategy .
this new plan will continue to prioritise actions to protect women from violence . "

" for example , we now fund four services for women from ethnic minorities in swansea , cardiff , newport and wrexham , not two as mentioned in the report .
" there are also six sexual assault referral centres in wales including one in north wales .
" we are currently developing a new strategic action plan to enhance the delivery of our national domestic abuse strategy .
this new plan will continue to prioritise actions to protect women from violence . "

there are waiting lists across wales , according to the national society of allotments and leisure gardens .
society chairman allan rees said the huge demand over the past 12 months had followed an increased interest in allotments for a number of years .
" we 've seen an upturn for the last two or three years but the last year has been horrendous .
the waiting lists have gone stupid , to be honest , " he said .
" the trend has been going for more people to grow their own , and this year , the amount of people being put out of work and the economic climate has had an effect . "
people want to grow their own and that , coupled with the financial situation , is driving it alan guest , wrexham council mr rees , who lives in bridgend , estimated there were around 15,000 to 20,000 allotment plots in wales but many areas had waiting lists .
" in maesteg all the plots are full and they were quite empty not so long ago , " he said .
the average plot costs around £ 25 a year for about 300 sq yd -lrb- 250 sq m -rrb- but prices and sizes vary .
local authorities run the vast majority of allotments and mr rees said some were now dividing up plots to meet the increased demand .
family occasion " but by reducing the plot you reduce the amount of food you can grow because you need another shed , another greenhouse and so on , " said mr rees .
terry walton , 62 , a gardening expert who regularly discusses allotments on bbc radio 2 's jeremy vine show , said they were also becoming a family affair .
" more people are fed up with supermarkets and want to grow their own , " he said .
" a lot of younger people make it a family occasion , particularly during the summer months , bringing their sandwiches and a flask of coffee .
" the kids get filthy like kids do and the parents can work on the allotment . "
you can grow a kilo of carrots for 4p -lsb- on an allotment -rsb- and they will cost 78p in the supermarket terry walton , radio 2 gardening expert mr walton , who has an allotment in the rhondda , said younger allotment holders were tending to grow different produce to older people , such as peppers and sweetcorn .
but big savings are possible whatever you choose to grow .
" i did some research for radio 2 and you can grow a kilo of carrots for 4p -lsb- on an allotment -rsb- and they will cost 78p in the supermarket while potatoes are 40p for a kilo and £ 1.08 in the supermarket , " said mr walton .
wrexham council , which has split up some plots , has about 330 plots in total and a waiting list of some 100 , an increase of 18 in the past couple of months .
wrexham environment divisional manager alan guest said : " people want to grow their own and that , coupled with the financial situation , is driving it .
" we 've never had this demand previously .
it 's been in the last 12 months it 's started creeping up .
" we ca n't just take a whole plot off a person .
if they give one up , depending on the site it 's on , it could become half plots or in some cases we could even go to quarter plots .
" the problem is we have n't got any surplus land that we can give to plots . "

" people want to grow their own and that , coupled with the financial situation , is driving it " alan guest , wrexham council mr rees , who lives in bridgend , estimated there were around 15,000 to 20,000 allotment plots in wales but many areas had waiting lists .
" in maesteg all the plots are full and they were quite empty not so long ago , " he said .
the average plot costs around £ 25 a year for about 300 sq yd -lrb- 250 sq m -rrb- but prices and sizes vary .
local authorities run the vast majority of allotments and mr rees said some were now dividing up plots to meet the increased demand .
family occasion " but by reducing the plot you reduce the amount of food you can grow because you need another shed , another greenhouse and so on , " said mr rees .
terry walton , 62 , a gardening expert who regularly discusses allotments on bbc radio 2 's jeremy vine show , said they were also becoming a family affair .
" more people are fed up with supermarkets and want to grow their own , " he said .
" a lot of younger people make it a family occasion , particularly during the summer months , bringing their sandwiches and a flask of coffee .
" the kids get filthy like kids do and the parents can work on the allotment . "
" you can grow a kilo of carrots for 4p -lsb- on an allotment -rsb- and they will cost 78p in the supermarket " terry walton , radio 2 gardening expert mr walton , who has an allotment in the rhondda , said younger allotment holders were tending to grow different produce to older people , such as peppers and sweetcorn .
but big savings are possible whatever you choose to grow .
" i did some research for radio 2 and you can grow a kilo of carrots for 4p -lsb- on an allotment -rsb- and they will cost 78p in the supermarket while potatoes are 40p for a kilo and £ 1.08 in the supermarket , " said mr walton .
wrexham council , which has split up some plots , has about 330 plots in total and a waiting list of some 100 , an increase of 18 in the past couple of months .
wrexham environment divisional manager alan guest said : " people want to grow their own and that , coupled with the financial situation , is driving it .
" we 've never had this demand previously .
it 's been in the last 12 months it 's started creeping up .
" we ca n't just take a whole plot off a person .
if they give one up , depending on the site it 's on , it could become half plots or in some cases we could even go to quarter plots .
" the problem is we have n't got any surplus land that we can give to plots . "

the men , all former deputy governors of bank indonesia , the country 's central bank , are accused of embezzling 100bn rupiah -lrb- $ 8.8m -rrb- in bank funds in 2003 .
they allegedly used the money to bribe mps and pay for lawyers for other bank officials facing corruption charges .
several senior bankers - including one former bank indonesia governor - have already been jailed in related cases .
one of the defendants in the current case , aulia pohan , is related by marriage to president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
analysts say the case is potentially embarrassing for mr yudhoyono , who is bidding for re-election later this year and has been keen to stress his anti-corruption credentials .
if found guilty , mr pohan - whose daughter is married to mr yudhoyono 's son - and his co-defendants face a maximum life sentence and 1bn rupiah fine .
the bankers are accused of siphoning off funds from a development fund run by bank indonesia .
they allegedly used the money to ensure the smooth passage of a banking bill through parliament , and to pay for lawyers for bankers involved in an earlier corruption scandal .
prosecutor rudi margono told the jakarta corruption court : " the defendants were fully aware that withdrawals from a central bank foundation were handed over to former central bank deputies to resolve the liquidity fund case and central bank bill amendment . "
last october , former bank indonesia governor burhanuddin abdullah was jailed for five years and fined $ 23,600 -lrb- £ 14,700 -rrb- for his part in the scandal .
