yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .
the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .
but japan , south korea and washington believe the launch was a screen to test a ballistic missile .
the us and japanese military say that the rocket failed to enter orbit .

he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .

he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .
obama will also meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the eu rotating presidency .
the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .

one month ago it looked like button 's team , now known as brawn gp -lrb- formerly honda -rrb- , would n't even be lining up on the grid .
now , he 's the bookmaker 's favorite to win it all .
button again started from pole position , but he got away poorly and had to recover positions in difficult wet conditions .
" it was a very exciting race , and although i would prefer a more boring race , i 'm happy to take victory , " button told reporters after the race was cut short for safety reasons .
a combination of a wet track after a malaysian thunderstorm and failing evening light meant that the stewards decided to call off the race with over 20 laps remaining .
" it was really bad conditions , you could n't actually see the circuit , " button added .

the veteran bmw sauber driver profited from the mistakes of others in the heavy rain to climb to second .
that 's the eighth time he 's finished second in his career , but heidfeld is still looking for his first grand prix victory .
it briefly looked like third place glock might challenge button for the win , but he lost time in the closing stages as the weather deteriorated .
" the race was so confusing , " glock said .
" at one stage when i was behind the safety car , i was told by my crew that i was first .
when the race was stopped i was told that i was second and later i was told that i was third .
i hope that i stay third now . "
safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari again picked up no points in the slippery conditions almost immediately after calling out the pace car , race officials decided to stop the race .
the cars lined up in order on the grid , waiting to see if the weather improved .
by the time the thunderstorm began to subside , the sun was starting to set on malaysia , meaning that drivers would have had to combat both a slippery surface and poor visibility .
red bull 's mark webber , the head of the grand prix drivers ' association asked his colleagues if they felt it was safe to continue .
" i nearly hit nico rosberg , and i was going just 15 kilometers -lrb- 9 miles -rrb- per hour at the time , " webber explained .
" it does not matter what points you get out of a race like this , it matters that the guys do n't get hurt . "
drivers will only be awarded half points for malaysia , because they did not complete three quarters of the race distance .
double world champion fernando alonso agreed that the circuit was undriveable .

the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .

" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .
the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .
but japan , south korea and washington believe the launch was a screen to test a ballistic missile .
the us and japanese military say that the rocket failed to enter orbit .
obama supports missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he will push for ratification of obama 's speech does not mean the us has immediate plans to get rid of all its nuclear weapons .
he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .
obama discusses environment , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has been meeting with european leaders obama 's keynote speech in prague is a highlight of his five-nation trip , which marks his first major foray onto the world stage since becoming president in january .
last week , obama attended a summit in london on the financial crisis and marked nato 's 60th anniversary in germany and france .
he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .
obama will also meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the eu rotating presidency .
the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .
but french president nicolas sarkozy has reiterated that he is opposed to turkey joining the eu : “ when it comes to the european union , it ’ s up to member-states of the european union to decide on membership ” , sarkozy said in an interview on french television . th / tw , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .

instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle .

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .

instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments .

" the ship was taken yesterday far out at sea , around 400 nautical miles -lrb- 740 km -rrb- from the somali coast , between kenya and the seychelles , " said andrew mwangura , of the east african seafarers assistance program .
" we believe the german ship has 24 crew on board , " mwangura said .
" we 're trying to establish their identities and the name of the vessel . "
more than 100 ships were attacked last year by pirates off the coast of somalia .
the gulf of aden is a vital transit route leading to the suez canal , where roughly 30 percent of the world 's oil is transported .
nato , the eu and other countries , including russia and china , have deployed warships to fight piracy and protect the lucrative multi-billion dollar shipping lanes from the heavily armed pirates who use high-powered speedboats to launch their attacks and kidnap crew members .
in march , a german navy frigate detained nine pirates for attacking a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden and later turned them over to kenya for legal prosecution .
although most pirates operating in the gulf of aden are from somalia , a former italian colony located in the horn of africa , the nation lacks a functioning legal system to stage a proper trial. tt / ca , afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .
the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .
but japan , south korea and washington believe the launch was a screen to test a ballistic missile .
the us and japanese military say that the rocket failed to enter orbit .
obama supports missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he will push for ratification of obama 's speech does not mean the us has immediate plans to get rid of all its nuclear weapons .
he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .
obama discusses environment , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has been meeting with european leaders obama 's keynote speech in prague is a highlight of his five-nation trip , which marks his first major foray onto the world stage since becoming president in january .
last week , obama attended a summit in london on the financial crisis and marked nato 's 60th anniversary in germany and france .
he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .
obama will also meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the eu rotating presidency .
the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .
but french president nicolas sarkozy has reiterated that he is opposed to turkey joining the eu : “ when it comes to the european union , it ’ s up to member-states of the european union to decide on membership ” , sarkozy said in an interview on french television . th / tw , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , does not see eye to eye with obama on turkey " the united states and europe must approach muslims as our friends , neighbors and partners in fighting injustice , intolerance and violence , " obama said in his address to european union leaders at a summit in prague .
" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .
" i have always been opposed to this entry and i remain opposed , " he said .

ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .

" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

" " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "

the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .

" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .

he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .

yet this might not be enough to save the company . opel might not have enough assets left to be worth saving , according to an article in german news magazine focus .
opel 's patents , plant and real estate have already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor , an unnamed german minister told the magazine .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .

forster confirmed that several investors from the private equity sector had expressed interest in buying into a new european consortium of companies backed with state aid .
opel needs billions yet state aid might be hard to come by .

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .
the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .
but japan , south korea and washington believe the launch was a screen to test a ballistic missile .
the us and japanese military say that the rocket failed to enter orbit .
obama supports missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he will push for ratification of obama 's speech does not mean the us has immediate plans to get rid of all its nuclear weapons .
he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .
obama discusses environment , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has been meeting with european leaders obama 's keynote speech in prague is a highlight of his five-nation trip , which marks his first major foray onto the world stage since becoming president in january .
last week , obama attended a summit in london on the financial crisis and marked nato 's 60th anniversary in germany and france .
he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .
obama will also meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the eu rotating presidency .
the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .
but french president nicolas sarkozy has reiterated that he is opposed to turkey joining the eu : “ when it comes to the european union , it ’ s up to member-states of the european union to decide on membership ” , sarkozy said in an interview on french television . th / tw , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ship was taken yesterday far out at sea , around 400 nautical miles -lrb- 740 km -rrb- from the somali coast , between kenya and the seychelles , " said andrew mwangura , of the east african seafarers assistance program .
" we believe the german ship has 24 crew on board , " mwangura said .
" we 're trying to establish their identities and the name of the vessel . "
more than 100 ships were attacked last year by pirates off the coast of somalia .
the gulf of aden is a vital transit route leading to the suez canal , where roughly 30 percent of the world 's oil is transported .
nato , the eu and other countries , including russia and china , have deployed warships to fight piracy and protect the lucrative multi-billion dollar shipping lanes from the heavily armed pirates who use high-powered speedboats to launch their attacks and kidnap crew members .
in march , a german navy frigate detained nine pirates for attacking a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden and later turned them over to kenya for legal prosecution .
although most pirates operating in the gulf of aden are from somalia , a former italian colony located in the horn of africa , the nation lacks a functioning legal system to stage a proper trial. tt / ca , afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ship was taken yesterday far out at sea , around 400 nautical miles -lrb- 740 km -rrb- from the somali coast , between kenya and the seychelles , " said andrew mwangura , of the east african seafarers assistance program .
" we believe the german ship has 24 crew on board , " mwangura said .
" we 're trying to establish their identities and the name of the vessel . "
more than 100 ships were attacked last year by pirates off the coast of somalia .
the gulf of aden is a vital transit route leading to the suez canal , where roughly 30 percent of the world 's oil is transported .
nato , the eu and other countries , including russia and china , have deployed warships to fight piracy and protect the lucrative multi-billion dollar shipping lanes from the heavily armed pirates who use high-powered speedboats to launch their attacks and kidnap crew members .
in march , a german navy frigate detained nine pirates for attacking a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden and later turned them over to kenya for legal prosecution .
although most pirates operating in the gulf of aden are from somalia , a former italian colony located in the horn of africa , the nation lacks a functioning legal system to stage a proper trial. tt / ca , afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , he 's the bookmaker 's favorite to win it all .
button again started from pole position , but he got away poorly and had to recover positions in difficult wet conditions .
" it was a very exciting race , and although i would prefer a more boring race , i 'm happy to take victory , " button told reporters after the race was cut short for safety reasons .
a combination of a wet track after a malaysian thunderstorm and failing evening light meant that the stewards decided to call off the race with over 20 laps remaining .

one month ago it looked like button 's team , now known as brawn gp -lrb- formerly honda -rrb- , would n't even be lining up on the grid .
now , he 's the bookmaker 's favorite to win it all .
button again started from pole position , but he got away poorly and had to recover positions in difficult wet conditions .
" it was a very exciting race , and although i would prefer a more boring race , i 'm happy to take victory , " button told reporters after the race was cut short for safety reasons .
a combination of a wet track after a malaysian thunderstorm and failing evening light meant that the stewards decided to call off the race with over 20 laps remaining .
" it was really bad conditions , you could n't actually see the circuit , " button added .
two germans on the podium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a violent thunderstorm turned the track into a swimming pool nick heidfeld and timo glock both profited from the bad weather , grabbing second and third places respectively .
heidfeld started well down the field , after looking off the pace in qualifying , but a good race strategy allowed him to spend as little time as possible in the pits .
the veteran bmw sauber driver profited from the mistakes of others in the heavy rain to climb to second .
that 's the eighth time he 's finished second in his career , but heidfeld is still looking for his first grand prix victory .
it briefly looked like third place glock might challenge button for the win , but he lost time in the closing stages as the weather deteriorated .
" the race was so confusing , " glock said .
" at one stage when i was behind the safety car , i was told by my crew that i was first .
when the race was stopped i was told that i was second and later i was told that i was third .
i hope that i stay third now . "
safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari again picked up no points in the slippery conditions almost immediately after calling out the pace car , race officials decided to stop the race .
the cars lined up in order on the grid , waiting to see if the weather improved .
by the time the thunderstorm began to subside , the sun was starting to set on malaysia , meaning that drivers would have had to combat both a slippery surface and poor visibility .
red bull 's mark webber , the head of the grand prix drivers ' association asked his colleagues if they felt it was safe to continue .
" i nearly hit nico rosberg , and i was going just 15 kilometers -lrb- 9 miles -rrb- per hour at the time , " webber explained .
" it does not matter what points you get out of a race like this , it matters that the guys do n't get hurt . "
drivers will only be awarded half points for malaysia , because they did not complete three quarters of the race distance .
double world champion fernando alonso agreed that the circuit was undriveable .
" it was just too dangerous , " he said .
" the conditions were very difficult .
it was completely dark . "

last season 's front runners ferrari and mclaren mercedes are still decidedly slow as they struggle to get to grip with sweeping rule changes in 2009 .
seventh place in malaysia for reigning world champion lewis hamilton means that mclaren have broken their duck , and picked up one championship point , but ferrari - the top team in eight of the last ten seasons - are currently dead last with no points to their name .
in a formula one world turned on its head , brawn gp are runaway leaders of the constructors ' championship with 25 points .
only toyota - on 16.5 - are anywhere near the former honda outfit .
bmw sauber and renault are next in line with just four championship points after two races .
in the driver 's championship back-to-back winner jenson button leads with 15 points .
his teammate rubens barrichello , on ten , is his closet rival .
the toyota pairing of jarno trulli and timo glock are next , on eight-and-a-half and eight points , respectively . the next round of the championship takes place in china in two weeks . msh / tt , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 05.04.2009 german states reluctant to save opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one has come forward to buy opel opel , the german subsidiary of troubled us automaker general motors , has begun currying favor with german state governments .
yet this might not be enough to save the company . opel might not have enough assets left to be worth saving , according to an article in german news magazine focus .
opel 's patents , plant and real estate have already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor , an unnamed german minister told the magazine .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .
" gm no longer has any authority over the assets . "
he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone realizes .
a new investor would have to negotiate the takeover with the us government and the banks .
investors are interested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future has become a political issue general motors europe chief carl-peter forster says potential private-equity and sovereign-capital investors remained interested in buying into the european unit .
he told german magazine spiegel that even if the gm parent company declared insolvency , production and sale of opel and vauxhall cars in europe would continue as normal .
forster confirmed that several investors from the private equity sector had expressed interest in buying into a new european consortium of companies backed with state aid .
opel needs billions yet state aid might be hard to come by .
gm 's lifeline from us taxpayers expires at the end of june .
if gm fails , opel could collapse .

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : german protestants celebrate 60 years of church festival the easter bunny : more popular than jesus germany 's autobahn chapels offer rest stops for the soul in germany , churches still central , but slipping luther decade launched for reformation anniversary religion -pipe- 05.04.2009 berlin exhibit spotlights far-reaching influence of church reformer calvin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john calvin broke from the catholic church in the 1520s and became a leader of the protestant reformation it 's been said that the ideas of 16th-century church reformer john calvin helped shape modern democracy and capitalism .
now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle .

" the ship was taken yesterday far out at sea , around 400 nautical miles -lrb- 740 km -rrb- from the somali coast , between kenya and the seychelles , " said andrew mwangura , of the east african seafarers assistance program .
" we believe the german ship has 24 crew on board , " mwangura said .
" we 're trying to establish their identities and the name of the vessel . "
more than 100 ships were attacked last year by pirates off the coast of somalia .
the gulf of aden is a vital transit route leading to the suez canal , where roughly 30 percent of the world 's oil is transported .
nato , the eu and other countries , including russia and china , have deployed warships to fight piracy and protect the lucrative multi-billion dollar shipping lanes from the heavily armed pirates who use high-powered speedboats to launch their attacks and kidnap crew members .
in march , a german navy frigate detained nine pirates for attacking a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden and later turned them over to kenya for legal prosecution .
although most pirates operating in the gulf of aden are from somalia , a former italian colony located in the horn of africa , the nation lacks a functioning legal system to stage a proper trial. tt / ca , afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , does not see eye to eye with obama on turkey " the united states and europe must approach muslims as our friends , neighbors and partners in fighting injustice , intolerance and violence , " obama said in his address to european union leaders at a summit in prague .
" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .
" i have always been opposed to this entry and i remain opposed , " he said .
slow progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes that turkey 's eu membership is still an open question turkey started eu accession negotiations in 2005 but has recently been criticized for making little progress due to domestic debates and a diminishing will for further expansion among eu members .
ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .
is turkey ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has enjoyed an enthusiastic welcome in europe european commission chief jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , welcomed obama 's comments and said the goal of turkish membership had not changed .
" we have started a process of negotiations with turkey for membership of the european union and that was a unanimous decision of the european union , all the 27 member states , " he said at a press conference at the end of the summit .
" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "
meeting global challenges obama took the opportunity of the one-day summit to set out the foreign policy visions of his administration , telling the 27 eu leaders that washington would play an active role in fighting climate change as well as dealing with the current economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states and europe will fight climate change together " europe and the united states are strongest when we stand together , " obama said . eu president mirek topolanek said the us leader 's visit to prague was " a symbol of the new level of us-european relations . " but in remarks to the summit , obama also stressed that he expected something from europe in return , saying the eu needed to take steps to overcome its differences on accepting guantanamo bay prisoners . " a strong partnership requires shared responsibility , " obama said . this , obama said , would help to ensure that action would be taken to help those who had been hardest hit by the economic storm while pledging to bridge the gap between the us and europe over global warming . the president 's remarks on climate change were greeted positively by eu leaders , with barroso saying the views in europe and washington were now much more in line .

one month ago it looked like button 's team , now known as brawn gp -lrb- formerly honda -rrb- , would n't even be lining up on the grid .
now , he 's the bookmaker 's favorite to win it all .
button again started from pole position , but he got away poorly and had to recover positions in difficult wet conditions .
" it was a very exciting race , and although i would prefer a more boring race , i 'm happy to take victory , " button told reporters after the race was cut short for safety reasons .
a combination of a wet track after a malaysian thunderstorm and failing evening light meant that the stewards decided to call off the race with over 20 laps remaining .

red bull 's mark webber , the head of the grand prix drivers ' association asked his colleagues if they felt it was safe to continue .
" i nearly hit nico rosberg , and i was going just 15 kilometers -lrb- 9 miles -rrb- per hour at the time , " webber explained .

yet this might not be enough to save the company . opel might not have enough assets left to be worth saving , according to an article in german news magazine focus .
opel 's patents , plant and real estate have already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor , an unnamed german minister told the magazine .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .
" gm no longer has any authority over the assets . "
he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone realizes .
a new investor would have to negotiate the takeover with the us government and the banks .
investors are interested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future has become a political issue general motors europe chief carl-peter forster says potential private-equity and sovereign-capital investors remained interested in buying into the european unit .
he told german magazine spiegel that even if the gm parent company declared insolvency , production and sale of opel and vauxhall cars in europe would continue as normal .
forster confirmed that several investors from the private equity sector had expressed interest in buying into a new european consortium of companies backed with state aid .
opel needs billions yet state aid might be hard to come by .
gm 's lifeline from us taxpayers expires at the end of june .
if gm fails , opel could collapse .
opel says it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in government help to avoid financial ruin .
the german subsidiary employs 25,000 workers .
" it would be irresponsible to allow opel to collapse simply out of principle , " the rhineland-palatinate state economics minister , hendrik hering , said last week .
he said his state plus hesse , north rhine-westphalia and thuringia could provide about 1.3 billion euros in aid according to the number of jobs at each production site .
opel dealers and workers are also ready to chip in hundreds of millions of euros to save the company , whose survival has become a political hot potato as german politicians begin positioning themselves ahead of parliamentary elections in september . nrt / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , does not see eye to eye with obama on turkey " the united states and europe must approach muslims as our friends , neighbors and partners in fighting injustice , intolerance and violence , " obama said in his address to european union leaders at a summit in prague .
" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .
" i have always been opposed to this entry and i remain opposed , " he said .
slow progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes that turkey 's eu membership is still an open question turkey started eu accession negotiations in 2005 but has recently been criticized for making little progress due to domestic debates and a diminishing will for further expansion among eu members .
ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .
is turkey ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has enjoyed an enthusiastic welcome in europe european commission chief jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , welcomed obama 's comments and said the goal of turkish membership had not changed .
" we have started a process of negotiations with turkey for membership of the european union and that was a unanimous decision of the european union , all the 27 member states , " he said at a press conference at the end of the summit .
" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "
meeting global challenges obama took the opportunity of the one-day summit to set out the foreign policy visions of his administration , telling the 27 eu leaders that washington would play an active role in fighting climate change as well as dealing with the current economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states and europe will fight climate change together " europe and the united states are strongest when we stand together , " obama said . eu president mirek topolanek said the us leader 's visit to prague was " a symbol of the new level of us-european relations . " but in remarks to the summit , obama also stressed that he expected something from europe in return , saying the eu needed to take steps to overcome its differences on accepting guantanamo bay prisoners . " a strong partnership requires shared responsibility , " obama said . this , obama said , would help to ensure that action would be taken to help those who had been hardest hit by the economic storm while pledging to bridge the gap between the us and europe over global warming . the president 's remarks on climate change were greeted positively by eu leaders , with barroso saying the views in europe and washington were now much more in line . " it is true we are now much more on a convergence path with our american friends than before -lsb- with -rsb- the past policies of the usa , " barroso said following the summit . tt / ca , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .

ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .

" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "

opel 's patents , plant and real estate have already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor , an unnamed german minister told the magazine .

button again started from pole position , but he got away poorly and had to recover positions in difficult wet conditions .
" it was a very exciting race , and although i would prefer a more boring race , i 'm happy to take victory , " button told reporters after the race was cut short for safety reasons .

red bull 's mark webber , the head of the grand prix drivers ' association asked his colleagues if they felt it was safe to continue .

button again started from pole position , but he got away poorly and had to recover positions in difficult wet conditions .
" it was a very exciting race , and although i would prefer a more boring race , i 'm happy to take victory , " button told reporters after the race was cut short for safety reasons .

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .
the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .
but japan , south korea and washington believe the launch was a screen to test a ballistic missile .
the us and japanese military say that the rocket failed to enter orbit .

he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .

last week , obama attended a summit in london on the financial crisis and marked nato 's 60th anniversary in germany and france .
he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .
obama will also meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the eu rotating presidency .
the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 05.04.2009 obama hits french and german nerves over turkey 's eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama would like to see turkey in the eu , but it 's not really up to him to decide the us stance that turkey belongs firmly in the eu took some of the gloss off a largely harmonious eu-us summit in prague with france flatly rejecting the idea and germany voicing reservations about it . us president barack obama , who flew to turkey on sunday night after attending the eu-us summit in prague , said that turkey 's membership in the bloc would be an important symbol of cooperation between the west and the muslim world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , does not see eye to eye with obama on turkey " the united states and europe must approach muslims as our friends , neighbors and partners in fighting injustice , intolerance and violence , " obama said in his address to european union leaders at a summit in prague .
" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .
" i have always been opposed to this entry and i remain opposed , " he said .
slow progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes that turkey 's eu membership is still an open question turkey started eu accession negotiations in 2005 but has recently been criticized for making little progress due to domestic debates and a diminishing will for further expansion among eu members .
ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .
is turkey ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has enjoyed an enthusiastic welcome in europe european commission chief jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , welcomed obama 's comments and said the goal of turkish membership had not changed .
" we have started a process of negotiations with turkey for membership of the european union and that was a unanimous decision of the european union , all the 27 member states , " he said at a press conference at the end of the summit .
" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "
meeting global challenges obama took the opportunity of the one-day summit to set out the foreign policy visions of his administration , telling the 27 eu leaders that washington would play an active role in fighting climate change as well as dealing with the current economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states and europe will fight climate change together " europe and the united states are strongest when we stand together , " obama said . eu president mirek topolanek said the us leader 's visit to prague was " a symbol of the new level of us-european relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : german protestants celebrate 60 years of church festival the easter bunny : more popular than jesus germany 's autobahn chapels offer rest stops for the soul in germany , churches still central , but slipping luther decade launched for reformation anniversary religion -pipe- 05.04.2009 berlin exhibit spotlights far-reaching influence of church reformer calvin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john calvin broke from the catholic church in the 1520s and became a leader of the protestant reformation it 's been said that the ideas of 16th-century church reformer john calvin helped shape modern democracy and capitalism .
now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 05.04.2009 obama hits french and german nerves over turkey 's eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama would like to see turkey in the eu , but it 's not really up to him to decide the us stance that turkey belongs firmly in the eu took some of the gloss off a largely harmonious eu-us summit in prague with france flatly rejecting the idea and germany voicing reservations about it . us president barack obama , who flew to turkey on sunday night after attending the eu-us summit in prague , said that turkey 's membership in the bloc would be an important symbol of cooperation between the west and the muslim world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , does not see eye to eye with obama on turkey " the united states and europe must approach muslims as our friends , neighbors and partners in fighting injustice , intolerance and violence , " obama said in his address to european union leaders at a summit in prague .
" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .
" i have always been opposed to this entry and i remain opposed , " he said .
slow progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes that turkey 's eu membership is still an open question turkey started eu accession negotiations in 2005 but has recently been criticized for making little progress due to domestic debates and a diminishing will for further expansion among eu members .
ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .
is turkey ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has enjoyed an enthusiastic welcome in europe european commission chief jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , welcomed obama 's comments and said the goal of turkish membership had not changed .
" we have started a process of negotiations with turkey for membership of the european union and that was a unanimous decision of the european union , all the 27 member states , " he said at a press conference at the end of the summit .
" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "
meeting global challenges obama took the opportunity of the one-day summit to set out the foreign policy visions of his administration , telling the 27 eu leaders that washington would play an active role in fighting climate change as well as dealing with the current economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states and europe will fight climate change together " europe and the united states are strongest when we stand together , " obama said . eu president mirek topolanek said the us leader 's visit to prague was " a symbol of the new level of us-european relations . " but in remarks to the summit , obama also stressed that he expected something from europe in return , saying the eu needed to take steps to overcome its differences on accepting guantanamo bay prisoners . " a strong partnership requires shared responsibility , " obama said . this , obama said , would help to ensure that action would be taken to help those who had been hardest hit by the economic storm while pledging to bridge the gap between the us and europe over global warming . the president 's remarks on climate change were greeted positively by eu leaders , with barroso saying the views in europe and washington were now much more in line .

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .
the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .
but japan , south korea and washington believe the launch was a screen to test a ballistic missile .
the us and japanese military say that the rocket failed to enter orbit .
obama supports missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he will push for ratification of obama 's speech does not mean the us has immediate plans to get rid of all its nuclear weapons .
he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .
obama discusses environment , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has been meeting with european leaders obama 's keynote speech in prague is a highlight of his five-nation trip , which marks his first major foray onto the world stage since becoming president in january .
last week , obama attended a summit in london on the financial crisis and marked nato 's 60th anniversary in germany and france .
he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .
obama will also meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the eu rotating presidency .
the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .
but french president nicolas sarkozy has reiterated that he is opposed to turkey joining the eu : “ when it comes to the european union , it ’ s up to member-states of the european union to decide on membership ” , sarkozy said in an interview on french television . th / tw , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one month ago it looked like button 's team , now known as brawn gp -lrb- formerly honda -rrb- , would n't even be lining up on the grid .
now , he 's the bookmaker 's favorite to win it all .
button again started from pole position , but he got away poorly and had to recover positions in difficult wet conditions .
" it was a very exciting race , and although i would prefer a more boring race , i 'm happy to take victory , " button told reporters after the race was cut short for safety reasons .
a combination of a wet track after a malaysian thunderstorm and failing evening light meant that the stewards decided to call off the race with over 20 laps remaining .
" it was really bad conditions , you could n't actually see the circuit , " button added .
two germans on the podium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a violent thunderstorm turned the track into a swimming pool nick heidfeld and timo glock both profited from the bad weather , grabbing second and third places respectively .
heidfeld started well down the field , after looking off the pace in qualifying , but a good race strategy allowed him to spend as little time as possible in the pits .
the veteran bmw sauber driver profited from the mistakes of others in the heavy rain to climb to second .
that 's the eighth time he 's finished second in his career , but heidfeld is still looking for his first grand prix victory .
it briefly looked like third place glock might challenge button for the win , but he lost time in the closing stages as the weather deteriorated .
" the race was so confusing , " glock said .
" at one stage when i was behind the safety car , i was told by my crew that i was first .

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

more than 100 ships were attacked last year by pirates off the coast of somalia .
the gulf of aden is a vital transit route leading to the suez canal , where roughly 30 percent of the world 's oil is transported .
nato , the eu and other countries , including russia and china , have deployed warships to fight piracy and protect the lucrative multi-billion dollar shipping lanes from the heavily armed pirates who use high-powered speedboats to launch their attacks and kidnap crew members .
in march , a german navy frigate detained nine pirates for attacking a merchant vessel in the gulf of aden and later turned them over to kenya for legal prosecution .
although most pirates operating in the gulf of aden are from somalia , a former italian colony located in the horn of africa , the nation lacks a functioning legal system to stage a proper trial. tt / ca , afp / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .

" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .

he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 05.04.2009 obama hits french and german nerves over turkey 's eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama would like to see turkey in the eu , but it 's not really up to him to decide the us stance that turkey belongs firmly in the eu took some of the gloss off a largely harmonious eu-us summit in prague with france flatly rejecting the idea and germany voicing reservations about it . us president barack obama , who flew to turkey on sunday night after attending the eu-us summit in prague , said that turkey 's membership in the bloc would be an important symbol of cooperation between the west and the muslim world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , does not see eye to eye with obama on turkey " the united states and europe must approach muslims as our friends , neighbors and partners in fighting injustice , intolerance and violence , " obama said in his address to european union leaders at a summit in prague .
" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .
" i have always been opposed to this entry and i remain opposed , " he said .
slow progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes that turkey 's eu membership is still an open question turkey started eu accession negotiations in 2005 but has recently been criticized for making little progress due to domestic debates and a diminishing will for further expansion among eu members .
ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .
is turkey ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has enjoyed an enthusiastic welcome in europe european commission chief jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , welcomed obama 's comments and said the goal of turkish membership had not changed .
" we have started a process of negotiations with turkey for membership of the european union and that was a unanimous decision of the european union , all the 27 member states , " he said at a press conference at the end of the summit .
" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "
meeting global challenges obama took the opportunity of the one-day summit to set out the foreign policy visions of his administration , telling the 27 eu leaders that washington would play an active role in fighting climate change as well as dealing with the current economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states and europe will fight climate change together " europe and the united states are strongest when we stand together , " obama said . eu president mirek topolanek said the us leader 's visit to prague was " a symbol of the new level of us-european relations . " but in remarks to the summit , obama also stressed that he expected something from europe in return , saying the eu needed to take steps to overcome its differences on accepting guantanamo bay prisoners . " a strong partnership requires shared responsibility , " obama said . this , obama said , would help to ensure that action would be taken to help those who had been hardest hit by the economic storm while pledging to bridge the gap between the us and europe over global warming . the president 's remarks on climate change were greeted positively by eu leaders , with barroso saying the views in europe and washington were now much more in line . " it is true we are now much more on a convergence path with our american friends than before -lsb- with -rsb- the past policies of the usa , " barroso said following the summit . tt / ca , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet this might not be enough to save the company . opel might not have enough assets left to be worth saving , according to an article in german news magazine focus .
opel 's patents , plant and real estate have already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor , an unnamed german minister told the magazine .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .
" gm no longer has any authority over the assets . "
he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone realizes .
a new investor would have to negotiate the takeover with the us government and the banks .
investors are interested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future has become a political issue general motors europe chief carl-peter forster says potential private-equity and sovereign-capital investors remained interested in buying into the european unit .
he told german magazine spiegel that even if the gm parent company declared insolvency , production and sale of opel and vauxhall cars in europe would continue as normal .
forster confirmed that several investors from the private equity sector had expressed interest in buying into a new european consortium of companies backed with state aid .
opel needs billions yet state aid might be hard to come by .
gm 's lifeline from us taxpayers expires at the end of june .
if gm fails , opel could collapse .
opel says it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in government help to avoid financial ruin .
the german subsidiary employs 25,000 workers .
" it would be irresponsible to allow opel to collapse simply out of principle , " the rhineland-palatinate state economics minister , hendrik hering , said last week .
he said his state plus hesse , north rhine-westphalia and thuringia could provide about 1.3 billion euros in aid according to the number of jobs at each production site .
opel dealers and workers are also ready to chip in hundreds of millions of euros to save the company , whose survival has become a political hot potato as german politicians begin positioning themselves ahead of parliamentary elections in september . nrt / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .

instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework .

with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .

obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .

the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .

european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .

the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .
the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .
but japan , south korea and washington believe the launch was a screen to test a ballistic missile .
the us and japanese military say that the rocket failed to enter orbit .
obama supports missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he will push for ratification of obama 's speech does not mean the us has immediate plans to get rid of all its nuclear weapons .
he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .
obama discusses environment , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has been meeting with european leaders obama 's keynote speech in prague is a highlight of his five-nation trip , which marks his first major foray onto the world stage since becoming president in january .
last week , obama attended a summit in london on the financial crisis and marked nato 's 60th anniversary in germany and france .
he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .
obama will also meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the eu rotating presidency .
the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .
but french president nicolas sarkozy has reiterated that he is opposed to turkey joining the eu : “ when it comes to the european union , it ’ s up to member-states of the european union to decide on membership ” , sarkozy said in an interview on french television . th / tw , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .
the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .
but japan , south korea and washington believe the launch was a screen to test a ballistic missile .
the us and japanese military say that the rocket failed to enter orbit .
obama supports missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he will push for ratification of obama 's speech does not mean the us has immediate plans to get rid of all its nuclear weapons .
he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .
obama discusses environment , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has been meeting with european leaders obama 's keynote speech in prague is a highlight of his five-nation trip , which marks his first major foray onto the world stage since becoming president in january .
last week , obama attended a summit in london on the financial crisis and marked nato 's 60th anniversary in germany and france .
he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .
obama will also meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the eu rotating presidency .
the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .
but french president nicolas sarkozy has reiterated that he is opposed to turkey joining the eu : “ when it comes to the european union , it ’ s up to member-states of the european union to decide on membership ” , sarkozy said in an interview on french television . th / tw , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet this might not be enough to save the company . opel might not have enough assets left to be worth saving , according to an article in german news magazine focus .
opel 's patents , plant and real estate have already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor , an unnamed german minister told the magazine .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .
" gm no longer has any authority over the assets . "
he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone realizes .
a new investor would have to negotiate the takeover with the us government and the banks .
investors are interested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future has become a political issue general motors europe chief carl-peter forster says potential private-equity and sovereign-capital investors remained interested in buying into the european unit .
he told german magazine spiegel that even if the gm parent company declared insolvency , production and sale of opel and vauxhall cars in europe would continue as normal .
forster confirmed that several investors from the private equity sector had expressed interest in buying into a new european consortium of companies backed with state aid .
opel needs billions yet state aid might be hard to come by .
gm 's lifeline from us taxpayers expires at the end of june .
if gm fails , opel could collapse .
opel says it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in government help to avoid financial ruin .
the german subsidiary employs 25,000 workers .
" it would be irresponsible to allow opel to collapse simply out of principle , " the rhineland-palatinate state economics minister , hendrik hering , said last week .
he said his state plus hesse , north rhine-westphalia and thuringia could provide about 1.3 billion euros in aid according to the number of jobs at each production site .
opel dealers and workers are also ready to chip in hundreds of millions of euros to save the company , whose survival has become a political hot potato as german politicians begin positioning themselves ahead of parliamentary elections in september . nrt / th , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , does not see eye to eye with obama on turkey " the united states and europe must approach muslims as our friends , neighbors and partners in fighting injustice , intolerance and violence , " obama said in his address to european union leaders at a summit in prague .
" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .
" i have always been opposed to this entry and i remain opposed , " he said .
slow progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes that turkey 's eu membership is still an open question turkey started eu accession negotiations in 2005 but has recently been criticized for making little progress due to domestic debates and a diminishing will for further expansion among eu members .
ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .
is turkey ready ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has enjoyed an enthusiastic welcome in europe european commission chief jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , welcomed obama 's comments and said the goal of turkish membership had not changed .
" we have started a process of negotiations with turkey for membership of the european union and that was a unanimous decision of the european union , all the 27 member states , " he said at a press conference at the end of the summit .
" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "
meeting global challenges obama took the opportunity of the one-day summit to set out the foreign policy visions of his administration , telling the 27 eu leaders that washington would play an active role in fighting climate change as well as dealing with the current economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states and europe will fight climate change together " europe and the united states are strongest when we stand together , " obama said . eu president mirek topolanek said the us leader 's visit to prague was " a symbol of the new level of us-european relations . " but in remarks to the summit , obama also stressed that he expected something from europe in return , saying the eu needed to take steps to overcome its differences on accepting guantanamo bay prisoners . " a strong partnership requires shared responsibility , " obama said . this , obama said , would help to ensure that action would be taken to help those who had been hardest hit by the economic storm while pledging to bridge the gap between the us and europe over global warming . the president 's remarks on climate change were greeted positively by eu leaders , with barroso saying the views in europe and washington were now much more in line . " it is true we are now much more on a convergence path with our american friends than before -lsb- with -rsb- the past policies of the usa , " barroso said following the summit . tt / ca , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one month ago it looked like button 's team , now known as brawn gp -lrb- formerly honda -rrb- , would n't even be lining up on the grid .
now , he 's the bookmaker 's favorite to win it all .
button again started from pole position , but he got away poorly and had to recover positions in difficult wet conditions .
" it was a very exciting race , and although i would prefer a more boring race , i 'm happy to take victory , " button told reporters after the race was cut short for safety reasons .
a combination of a wet track after a malaysian thunderstorm and failing evening light meant that the stewards decided to call off the race with over 20 laps remaining .
" it was really bad conditions , you could n't actually see the circuit , " button added .
two germans on the podium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a violent thunderstorm turned the track into a swimming pool nick heidfeld and timo glock both profited from the bad weather , grabbing second and third places respectively .

one month ago it looked like button 's team , now known as brawn gp -lrb- formerly honda -rrb- , would n't even be lining up on the grid .
now , he 's the bookmaker 's favorite to win it all .
button again started from pole position , but he got away poorly and had to recover positions in difficult wet conditions .
" it was a very exciting race , and although i would prefer a more boring race , i 'm happy to take victory , " button told reporters after the race was cut short for safety reasons .
a combination of a wet track after a malaysian thunderstorm and failing evening light meant that the stewards decided to call off the race with over 20 laps remaining .
" it was really bad conditions , you could n't actually see the circuit , " button added .
two germans on the podium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a violent thunderstorm turned the track into a swimming pool nick heidfeld and timo glock both profited from the bad weather , grabbing second and third places respectively .
heidfeld started well down the field , after looking off the pace in qualifying , but a good race strategy allowed him to spend as little time as possible in the pits .
the veteran bmw sauber driver profited from the mistakes of others in the heavy rain to climb to second .
that 's the eighth time he 's finished second in his career , but heidfeld is still looking for his first grand prix victory .
it briefly looked like third place glock might challenge button for the win , but he lost time in the closing stages as the weather deteriorated .
" the race was so confusing , " glock said .
" at one stage when i was behind the safety car , i was told by my crew that i was first .
when the race was stopped i was told that i was second and later i was told that i was third .
i hope that i stay third now . "
safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari again picked up no points in the slippery conditions almost immediately after calling out the pace car , race officials decided to stop the race .
the cars lined up in order on the grid , waiting to see if the weather improved .
by the time the thunderstorm began to subside , the sun was starting to set on malaysia , meaning that drivers would have had to combat both a slippery surface and poor visibility .
red bull 's mark webber , the head of the grand prix drivers ' association asked his colleagues if they felt it was safe to continue .
" i nearly hit nico rosberg , and i was going just 15 kilometers -lrb- 9 miles -rrb- per hour at the time , " webber explained .
" it does not matter what points you get out of a race like this , it matters that the guys do n't get hurt . "
drivers will only be awarded half points for malaysia , because they did not complete three quarters of the race distance .
double world champion fernando alonso agreed that the circuit was undriveable .
" it was just too dangerous , " he said .
" the conditions were very difficult .
it was completely dark . "

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .
the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .
but japan , south korea and washington believe the launch was a screen to test a ballistic missile .
the us and japanese military say that the rocket failed to enter orbit .
obama supports missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he will push for ratification of obama 's speech does not mean the us has immediate plans to get rid of all its nuclear weapons .
he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .
obama discusses environment , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has been meeting with european leaders obama 's keynote speech in prague is a highlight of his five-nation trip , which marks his first major foray onto the world stage since becoming president in january .
last week , obama attended a summit in london on the financial crisis and marked nato 's 60th anniversary in germany and france .
he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .

he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .

he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .
obama will also meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the eu rotating presidency .
the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .
but french president nicolas sarkozy has reiterated that he is opposed to turkey joining the eu : “ when it comes to the european union , it ’ s up to member-states of the european union to decide on membership ” , sarkozy said in an interview on french television . th / tw , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .

instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework .

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , does not see eye to eye with obama on turkey " the united states and europe must approach muslims as our friends , neighbors and partners in fighting injustice , intolerance and violence , " obama said in his address to european union leaders at a summit in prague .
" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .
" i have always been opposed to this entry and i remain opposed , " he said .
slow progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes that turkey 's eu membership is still an open question turkey started eu accession negotiations in 2005 but has recently been criticized for making little progress due to domestic debates and a diminishing will for further expansion among eu members .
ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has enjoyed an enthusiastic welcome in europe european commission chief jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , welcomed obama 's comments and said the goal of turkish membership had not changed .
" we have started a process of negotiations with turkey for membership of the european union and that was a unanimous decision of the european union , all the 27 member states , " he said at a press conference at the end of the summit .
" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "
meeting global challenges obama took the opportunity of the one-day summit to set out the foreign policy visions of his administration , telling the 27 eu leaders that washington would play an active role in fighting climate change as well as dealing with the current economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states and europe will fight climate change together " europe and the united states are strongest when we stand together , " obama said . eu president mirek topolanek said the us leader 's visit to prague was " a symbol of the new level of us-european relations . " but in remarks to the summit , obama also stressed that he expected something from europe in return , saying the eu needed to take steps to overcome its differences on accepting guantanamo bay prisoners . " a strong partnership requires shared responsibility , " obama said . this , obama said , would help to ensure that action would be taken to help those who had been hardest hit by the economic storm while pledging to bridge the gap between the us and europe over global warming . the president 's remarks on climate change were greeted positively by eu leaders , with barroso saying the views in europe and washington were now much more in line .

a combination of a wet track after a malaysian thunderstorm and failing evening light meant that the stewards decided to call off the race with over 20 laps remaining .

the veteran bmw sauber driver profited from the mistakes of others in the heavy rain to climb to second .
that 's the eighth time he 's finished second in his career , but heidfeld is still looking for his first grand prix victory .
it briefly looked like third place glock might challenge button for the win , but he lost time in the closing stages as the weather deteriorated .
" the race was so confusing , " glock said .
" at one stage when i was behind the safety car , i was told by my crew that i was first .

red bull 's mark webber , the head of the grand prix drivers ' association asked his colleagues if they felt it was safe to continue .

yet this might not be enough to save the company . opel might not have enough assets left to be worth saving , according to an article in german news magazine focus .
opel 's patents , plant and real estate have already been mortgaged to the us government and us banks as security for loans , and could thus not be acquired by a new investor , an unnamed german minister told the magazine .
" opel is just an empty shell , " the minister was quoted as saying .
" gm no longer has any authority over the assets . "
he added that separating opel from the rest of gm would be far more complicated and costly than anyone realizes .
a new investor would have to negotiate the takeover with the us government and the banks .
investors are interested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's future has become a political issue general motors europe chief carl-peter forster says potential private-equity and sovereign-capital investors remained interested in buying into the european unit .
he told german magazine spiegel that even if the gm parent company declared insolvency , production and sale of opel and vauxhall cars in europe would continue as normal .
forster confirmed that several investors from the private equity sector had expressed interest in buying into a new european consortium of companies backed with state aid .
opel needs billions yet state aid might be hard to come by .
gm 's lifeline from us taxpayers expires at the end of june .
if gm fails , opel could collapse .

with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .

" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .

the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "

one month ago it looked like button 's team , now known as brawn gp -lrb- formerly honda -rrb- , would n't even be lining up on the grid .
now , he 's the bookmaker 's favorite to win it all .
button again started from pole position , but he got away poorly and had to recover positions in difficult wet conditions .
" it was a very exciting race , and although i would prefer a more boring race , i 'm happy to take victory , " button told reporters after the race was cut short for safety reasons .
a combination of a wet track after a malaysian thunderstorm and failing evening light meant that the stewards decided to call off the race with over 20 laps remaining .
" it was really bad conditions , you could n't actually see the circuit , " button added .
two germans on the podium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a violent thunderstorm turned the track into a swimming pool nick heidfeld and timo glock both profited from the bad weather , grabbing second and third places respectively .
heidfeld started well down the field , after looking off the pace in qualifying , but a good race strategy allowed him to spend as little time as possible in the pits .
the veteran bmw sauber driver profited from the mistakes of others in the heavy rain to climb to second .
that 's the eighth time he 's finished second in his career , but heidfeld is still looking for his first grand prix victory .
it briefly looked like third place glock might challenge button for the win , but he lost time in the closing stages as the weather deteriorated .
" the race was so confusing , " glock said .
" at one stage when i was behind the safety car , i was told by my crew that i was first .
when the race was stopped i was told that i was second and later i was told that i was third .
i hope that i stay third now . "
safety first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari again picked up no points in the slippery conditions almost immediately after calling out the pace car , race officials decided to stop the race .
the cars lined up in order on the grid , waiting to see if the weather improved .
by the time the thunderstorm began to subside , the sun was starting to set on malaysia , meaning that drivers would have had to combat both a slippery surface and poor visibility .
red bull 's mark webber , the head of the grand prix drivers ' association asked his colleagues if they felt it was safe to continue .
" i nearly hit nico rosberg , and i was going just 15 kilometers -lrb- 9 miles -rrb- per hour at the time , " webber explained .
" it does not matter what points you get out of a race like this , it matters that the guys do n't get hurt . "
drivers will only be awarded half points for malaysia , because they did not complete three quarters of the race distance .
double world champion fernando alonso agreed that the circuit was undriveable .
" it was just too dangerous , " he said .

it was completely dark . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , does not see eye to eye with obama on turkey " the united states and europe must approach muslims as our friends , neighbors and partners in fighting injustice , intolerance and violence , " obama said in his address to european union leaders at a summit in prague .
" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .
" i have always been opposed to this entry and i remain opposed , " he said .
slow progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes that turkey 's eu membership is still an open question turkey started eu accession negotiations in 2005 but has recently been criticized for making little progress due to domestic debates and a diminishing will for further expansion among eu members .
ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .

" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , right , does not see eye to eye with obama on turkey " the united states and europe must approach muslims as our friends , neighbors and partners in fighting injustice , intolerance and violence , " obama said in his address to european union leaders at a summit in prague .
" moving forward towards turkish membership in the eu would be an important signal of your commitment to this agenda and ensure that we continue to anchor turkey firmly in europe , " he added .
the us has long supported turkey 's efforts to become a member of the eu , but a number of countries - including france and germany - have come out against turkey 's accession into the bloc and have instead offered the country special treatment that falls short of full membership .
" i have been working hand-in-hand with president obama , but when it comes to the european union it 's up to member-states of the european union to decide " on membership , sarkozy told french television in an interview from prague .
" i have always been opposed to this entry and i remain opposed , " he said .
slow progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes that turkey 's eu membership is still an open question turkey started eu accession negotiations in 2005 but has recently been criticized for making little progress due to domestic debates and a diminishing will for further expansion among eu members .
ankara has opened talks on 10 out of the 35 policy areas it needs for eu entry but has provisionally completed negotiations on just one .
the eu has frozen eight chapters as ankara refuses to open its ports and airports to greek cypriots .
under a policy setup by her predecessor , german chancellor angela merkel has officially accepted the ongoing accession talks .
but she and other members of germany 's conservative parties have also been promoting offering turkey a " privileged partnership " rather than membership in the bloc .
" i believe that a close relation between the muslim world - and turkey , in particular - with the european union is in the interest of us all , " merkel said in prague .
but she stressed that the actual form in which relations will develop is yet to be determined .
" we 're still wrestling with that , " merkel said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us president has enjoyed an enthusiastic welcome in europe european commission chief jose manuel barroso , on the other hand , welcomed obama 's comments and said the goal of turkish membership had not changed .
" we have started a process of negotiations with turkey for membership of the european union and that was a unanimous decision of the european union , all the 27 member states , " he said at a press conference at the end of the summit .
" of course we have to go on with the negotiations and , at the end , we have to see if turkey is ready to join and if the european union is ready to integrate turkey . "
" that has been clear and consistent position of the european commission and therefore i very much welcome the comments of president obama . "
meeting global challenges obama took the opportunity of the one-day summit to set out the foreign policy visions of his administration , telling the 27 eu leaders that washington would play an active role in fighting climate change as well as dealing with the current economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states and europe will fight climate change together " europe and the united states are strongest when we stand together , " obama said . eu president mirek topolanek said the us leader 's visit to prague was " a symbol of the new level of us-european relations . " but in remarks to the summit , obama also stressed that he expected something from europe in return , saying the eu needed to take steps to overcome its differences on accepting guantanamo bay prisoners . " a strong partnership requires shared responsibility , " obama said . this , obama said , would help to ensure that action would be taken to help those who had been hardest hit by the economic storm while pledging to bridge the gap between the us and europe over global warming . the president 's remarks on climate change were greeted positively by eu leaders , with barroso saying the views in europe and washington were now much more in line .

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .

now , 500 years after his birth , the german historical museum in berlin is taking a closer look . with more than 360 historical documents , works of art and liturgical objects , the berlin show is the largest exhibition in europe during the calvin year , which marks half a millennium since the reformer 's birth on july 10 , 1509 , in noyon , france . the exhibition focuses on calvin as a person and his influence on europe .
it also touches on issues like expulsion , migration and minorities - problematic topics for europe during many different epochs .
calvin himself was forced to flee france for switzerland in 1535 when religious tensions led to violent uprisings against protestants . it was a time when europe was dominated by monarchs and the catholic church had an influential hand in both politics and civil society . just two decades earlier , martin luther had posted his 95 theses on the door of the church in wittenberg , advocating salvation though faith and inadvertently sparking the beginnings of the protestant reformation . it was in this context that calvin developed and promoted the budding protestant movement .
his particular theological take later became known as calvinism . the rise of the non-corrupt state " calvinism was terribly influential in shaping the modern way of life , " recognized catholic theologian and retired professor arnold angenendt told deutsche welle .
" calvin is interpreted as saying that if you make just one slipup , it 's a sign that you 've been rejected by god . " calvinism is known for promoting hard work , reliability and perfectionism . " calvin 's ethics spawned the professional , responsible civil servant , " added angenendt .
" that 's the rise of the european state . " a civil servant who behaves according to calvinist ethics is unlikely to become involved in corruption .
those western european countries most influenced by calvin have less corrupt governments than their eastern neighbors , said angenendt . bildunterschrift : " church elder " and " reformed youth " by artists ari versluis and ellie uyttenbroek are part of the exhibit individual responsibility instead of hierarchy calvinist churches are characterized not only by their strong work ethic but also by their non-hierarchical organization , achim detmers from the evangelical church in germany told deutsche welle in an e-mail interview . this " democratic " equality not only brings freedom , but also responsibility . calvinism does n't prescribe overarching creeds for every situation , said detmers .
instead , new historical situations - such as the rise of national socialism in 1930s germany or times of economic inequality - require believers to look again at the bible and make relevant interpretations . the reduction of the church 's political influence and the emphasis on the role of the individual are all tenets of calvinism that have more in common with modern european democracy than late medieval monarchies . " calvin advocated an aristo-democracy , " said detmers .
" he supported the organizational separation of church and state , although he wanted to ensure that society was based on christian principles , like the ten commandments . " " particularly in comparison to other denominations , which are organized more hierarchically and place less value on education and participation from believers , calvinism offers ' modern ' societies a great deal of potential for innovation and reflection , " said detmers . a calvinist solution to the finance crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abraham van conninxlo 's dinner plate from 1661 however , the evangelical minister cautioned against making too strong a connection between calvin and the development of modern democracy and capitalism , adding that there were plenty of other sociological and historical factors that played a role . whether calvinist ideals - based more on fear than grace - should have a greater influence on today 's society is a different question . at the opening of the berlin exhibition earlier this week , dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende pointed out that the strong work ethic that forms an important part of calvinist theology is " worked into a moral framework . " in light of the current global economic crisis , it would be " a good thing if the financial markets were more strongly governed by this principle . " according to the evangelical church in germany , over 25 million people belong to the evangelical church .
two million of them belong to reformed protestant churches .
other strongholds of reformist theology in europe are switzerland , the netherlands , hungary , scotland and france . in germany , membership in state-organized evangelical and catholic churches is determined by voluntary church tax registration .
an additional 25 million germans officially belong to the catholic church . the calvinism exhibition at the german historical museum in berlin runs through july 19 , 2009 .

yet his support for a controversial us missile shield in eastern europe could anger russia . an estimated 30,000 people streamed into the historic center of prague on sunday to hear obama deliver his first major public speech in europe since becoming president .
with prague castle as a backdrop , obama proposed measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons , stop further nuclear proliferation and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials .
the us leader 's speech comes as the czech republic marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism .
" as the only nuclear power who have used a nuclear weapon , the united states has a moral responsibility to act , " obama said .
" we can not succeed in this endeavor alone , but we can start it . "
germany ’ s foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has called for nuclear disarmament plans to be mobilized this year .
“ nulcear weapons and their unchecked proliferation are a major threat to us all , ” steinmeier told the mass circulation german tabloid bild am sonntag .
call for action on north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama singled out north korea in his remarks obama 's focus on nuclear non-proliferation took on special significance as it came just hours after north korea announced it had launched a long-range rocket into space .
the rocket was launched in defiance of warnings from north korea 's asian neighbors and washington .
obama condemned the north korean move as a " provocative act . "
he called for a quick , joint statement condemning the launch .
" this provocation underscores the need for action , " obama said .
" violations must be punished .
words must mean something .
now is the time for a strong international response . "
pyongyang has said it was putting a communications satellite into orbit .
but japan , south korea and washington believe the launch was a screen to test a ballistic missile .
the us and japanese military say that the rocket failed to enter orbit .
obama supports missile shield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said he will push for ratification of obama 's speech does not mean the us has immediate plans to get rid of all its nuclear weapons .
he said the united states will maintain a safe , secure and reliable nuclear capability to deter adversaries and reassure its allies .
he also indicated that the united states would " go forward " with a controversial missile defense system planned for the czech republic and poland .
the proposal has angered russia , despite us assurances that the system is meant to protect europe from an attack by iran .
" as long as the threat from iran persists , we will go forward with the missile system , " obama said .
" if the iranian threat is eliminated , we will have a stronger basis for security , and the driving force for missile construction in europe will be removed . "
obama did suggest that iran could pursue its nuclear power ambitions , provided the program was subject to “ rigorous inspections ” .
the missile shield announcement could heighten tensions with russia .
yet obama said he 's eager to negotiate a legally-binding arms reduction treaty with russia and all other nuclear powers .
the us will also seek to ratify a nuclear test ban treaty .
obama discusses environment , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has been meeting with european leaders obama 's keynote speech in prague is a highlight of his five-nation trip , which marks his first major foray onto the world stage since becoming president in january .
last week , obama attended a summit in london on the financial crisis and marked nato 's 60th anniversary in germany and france .
he will spend sunday meeting with leaders of the 27-member european union in prague .
european leaders are expected to press obama on two global issues - the economic crisis and climate change .
he has also called for european help accepting detainees from the guantanamo bay prison which he intends to close early next year , and on continuing efforts to bring stability to afghanistan .
obama will also meet with czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the eu rotating presidency .
the outgoing prime minister , who last month lost a vote of confidence in the czech parliament , recently denounced obama 's massive economic stimulus plan as " the road to hell . " the next stop on obama 's first major international trip will be turkey .
obama took the opportunity to urge eu member states to accept turkey into the bloc , saying it would be a positive sign to the muslim world .
but french president nicolas sarkozy has reiterated that he is opposed to turkey joining the eu : “ when it comes to the european union , it ’ s up to member-states of the european union to decide on membership ” , sarkozy said in an interview on french television . th / tw , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the seal protection action group told the bbc 's countryfile programme that as many as 5,000 of the mammals are shot in scotland every year .
the salmon farming industry disputed the figure , and said shooting seals was necessary to protect stocks .
it is currently legal to shoot seals outside their breeding season .
although seals have become one of britain 's most iconic and best-loved wild animals , their love of fresh salmon has brought them into increasing conflict with a fish farming industry looking to cash in on the growing human appetite for cheap salmon .
more than one million salmon meals eaten in the uk every day , and the industry is one of the biggest employers in the scottish highlands . "
we have had several seals washed up with bullet holes in their heads " mark carter hebridean trust common seal numbers have plummeted by a third in britain over the past seven years , with ecological changes and a shortage of wild fish generally thought to be behind the drop .
but andy ottaway , of the seal protection action group , said he believed the shooting of seals was another major factor behind the animal 's decline .
the group was established 30 years ago oppose the mass culling of seals on orkney .
mr ottoway said : " little did we realise then that the cull would simply be driven underground and continue in secret to this day .
" the seal shooting takes place in very remote locations in sea lochs around scotland and there are no witnesses , and under the law the industry does n't even need to release the figures of the numbers they have killed .
" we believe there is a mass slaughter of seals in scotland - up to 5,000 each year . "
mark carter , of the hebridean trust , said he believed the general decline in seal numbers was particularly noticeable in the areas surrounding fish farms .
" scientifically we do n't know the real reason behind the total decline , but what we do know is that when they are situated near a fish farm then there is a decline and shooting is probably one of the main reasons , " he told countryfile .
" we have got people who have actually witnessed the shooting on fish farms , and we have had several seals washed up with bullet holes in their heads .
" the problem is it is not just adults that find them - my children found one washed up on the beach in front of the house .
we did an autopsy and the skull was completely shattered . "
it is not just conservationists who are worried .
donald mclean has been taking tourists seal watching in the sound of kerrera , off the west coast of scotland , for 30 years .
the area is traditionally one of the best places in the world to see common seals in their natural habitat .
but mr mclean said a big increase in the number of local salmon farms - there are currently some 300 in the area - had coincided with a sharp drop in seal sightings .
" when i first started you would come out and see between 60 and 80 seals on average , but now you are down to 10 or 20 , " he explained .
mr mclean claimed a large colony of seals which would regularly bask on a rocky outcrop in the sound disappeared completely when a salmon farm opened up nearby and started shooting them .
but scott landsburgh of the scottish salmon producers ' organisation , said a single seal attack could kill several thousand farmed salmon .
he said : " the seals are very aggressive - they attack the nets and can bite through them , and they can also actually use their flippers to steal salmon out of the cages .
" it 's not just a few - it is thousands of salmon .
indiscriminate attacks by seals can cause trauma throughout the cages and we can lose 2,000 or 3,000 salmon at a time , not only by attacking them but also just be being in the vicinity . "
" we all want to protect the seals , but our paramount responsibility is the welfare of the salmon " scott landsburgh scottish salmon producers association mr landsburgh showed the programme photographs of the aftermath of one recent salmon attack where up to 1,000 salmon were killed by a seal getting into their cage , and said there had been reports of up to a third of fish in a cage being killed from the trauma caused by a seal merely sitting nearby watching them .
" we all like seals , we all want to protect the seals , but our paramount responsibility is the welfare of the salmon , " he said .
" let me put this in perspective - we had 30,000 seal attacks on scottish salmon farms last year .
our industry has reported to us that 489 seals were shot by the salmon industry . "
it is not just salmon farmers who are doing the shooting - seals are also regularly killed by nets men and anglers around scotland 's east coast rivers .
callan duck , of the sea mammal research unit at st andrews university , said he believed it was legitimate in some circumstances to shoot seals around fish farms .
he said : " if a seal is damaging a salmon cage and releasing salmon into the open water for a ready meal , then probably the only way to solve that problem is to remove the seal as once it has learned to access an easy food source it will keep doing it .
" but to randomly shoot animals at adjacent haul out sites or that happen to be passing the fish farm - no , i do n't think -lsb- it is justified -rsb- . "
at least one supermarket chain is considering introducing " seal-friendly " salmon products , and several shoppers who were surprised to learn that seals were still regularly being shot told countryfile they would be willing to pay more for their salmon if they knew its farming had not caused the death of seals .

advertisement salmon farmers claim they shoot fewer than 500 seals every year a " secret slaughter " of seals is being carried out by fish farmers around the coastline of scotland , campaigners have claimed .
the seal protection action group told the bbc 's countryfile programme that as many as 5,000 of the mammals are shot in scotland every year .
the salmon farming industry disputed the figure , and said shooting seals was necessary to protect stocks .
it is currently legal to shoot seals outside their breeding season .
although seals have become one of britain 's most iconic and best-loved wild animals , their love of fresh salmon has brought them into increasing conflict with a fish farming industry looking to cash in on the growing human appetite for cheap salmon .
more than one million salmon meals eaten in the uk every day , and the industry is one of the biggest employers in the scottish highlands .
we have had several seals washed up with bullet holes in their heads mark carter hebridean trust common seal numbers have plummeted by a third in britain over the past seven years , with ecological changes and a shortage of wild fish generally thought to be behind the drop .
but andy ottaway , of the seal protection action group , said he believed the shooting of seals was another major factor behind the animal 's decline .
the group was established 30 years ago oppose the mass culling of seals on orkney .
mr ottoway said : " little did we realise then that the cull would simply be driven underground and continue in secret to this day .
" the seal shooting takes place in very remote locations in sea lochs around scotland and there are no witnesses , and under the law the industry does n't even need to release the figures of the numbers they have killed .
" we believe there is a mass slaughter of seals in scotland - up to 5,000 each year . "
mark carter , of the hebridean trust , said he believed the general decline in seal numbers was particularly noticeable in the areas surrounding fish farms .
" scientifically we do n't know the real reason behind the total decline , but what we do know is that when they are situated near a fish farm then there is a decline and shooting is probably one of the main reasons , " he told countryfile .
" we have got people who have actually witnessed the shooting on fish farms , and we have had several seals washed up with bullet holes in their heads .
" the problem is it is not just adults that find them - my children found one washed up on the beach in front of the house .
we did an autopsy and the skull was completely shattered . "
seals are often washed up with bullet holes in their head it is not just conservationists who are worried .
donald mclean has been taking tourists seal watching in the sound of kerrera , off the west coast of scotland , for 30 years .
the area is traditionally one of the best places in the world to see common seals in their natural habitat .
but mr mclean said a big increase in the number of local salmon farms - there are currently some 300 in the area - had coincided with a sharp drop in seal sightings .
" when i first started you would come out and see between 60 and 80 seals on average , but now you are down to 10 or 20 , " he explained .
mr mclean claimed a large colony of seals which would regularly bask on a rocky outcrop in the sound disappeared completely when a salmon farm opened up nearby and started shooting them .
but scott landsburgh of the scottish salmon producers ' organisation , said a single seal attack could kill several thousand farmed salmon .
he said : " the seals are very aggressive - they attack the nets and can bite through them , and they can also actually use their flippers to steal salmon out of the cages .
" it 's not just a few - it is thousands of salmon .
indiscriminate attacks by seals can cause trauma throughout the cages and we can lose 2,000 or 3,000 salmon at a time , not only by attacking them but also just be being in the vicinity . "
we all want to protect the seals , but our paramount responsibility is the welfare of the salmon scott landsburgh scottish salmon producers association mr landsburgh showed the programme photographs of the aftermath of one recent salmon attack where up to 1,000 salmon were killed by a seal getting into their cage , and said there had been reports of up to a third of fish in a cage being killed from the trauma caused by a seal merely sitting nearby watching them .
" we all like seals , we all want to protect the seals , but our paramount responsibility is the welfare of the salmon , " he said .
" let me put this in perspective - we had 30,000 seal attacks on scottish salmon farms last year .
our industry has reported to us that 489 seals were shot by the salmon industry . "
it is not just salmon farmers who are doing the shooting - seals are also regularly killed by nets men and anglers around scotland 's east coast rivers .
callan duck , of the sea mammal research unit at st andrews university , said he believed it was legitimate in some circumstances to shoot seals around fish farms .
he said : " if a seal is damaging a salmon cage and releasing salmon into the open water for a ready meal , then probably the only way to solve that problem is to remove the seal as once it has learned to access an easy food source it will keep doing it .
" but to randomly shoot animals at adjacent haul out sites or that happen to be passing the fish farm - no , i do n't think -lsb- it is justified -rsb- . "
at least one supermarket chain is considering introducing " seal-friendly " salmon products , and several shoppers who were surprised to learn that seals were still regularly being shot told countryfile they would be willing to pay more for their salmon if they knew its farming had not caused the death of seals .
some fish farms are already experimenting with non-lethal methods of protecting their stocks by using nets made from stronger fibres or special acoustic devices to scare away hungry seals .
but it could be that the long-term future of seals could rest in the hands of politicians , with marine bills due to be debated in both the scottish and uk parliaments in the coming months .

he said : " the seals are very aggressive - they attack the nets and can bite through them , and they can also actually use their flippers to steal salmon out of the cages .
" it 's not just a few - it is thousands of salmon .
indiscriminate attacks by seals can cause trauma throughout the cages and we can lose 2,000 or 3,000 salmon at a time , not only by attacking them but also just be being in the vicinity . "
we all want to protect the seals , but our paramount responsibility is the welfare of the salmon scott landsburgh scottish salmon producers association mr landsburgh showed the programme photographs of the aftermath of one recent salmon attack where up to 1,000 salmon were killed by a seal getting into their cage , and said there had been reports of up to a third of fish in a cage being killed from the trauma caused by a seal merely sitting nearby watching them .
" we all like seals , we all want to protect the seals , but our paramount responsibility is the welfare of the salmon , " he said .
" let me put this in perspective - we had 30,000 seal attacks on scottish salmon farms last year .
our industry has reported to us that 489 seals were shot by the salmon industry . "
it is not just salmon farmers who are doing the shooting - seals are also regularly killed by nets men and anglers around scotland 's east coast rivers .
callan duck , of the sea mammal research unit at st andrews university , said he believed it was legitimate in some circumstances to shoot seals around fish farms .
he said : " if a seal is damaging a salmon cage and releasing salmon into the open water for a ready meal , then probably the only way to solve that problem is to remove the seal as once it has learned to access an easy food source it will keep doing it .
" but to randomly shoot animals at adjacent haul out sites or that happen to be passing the fish farm - no , i do n't think -lsb- it is justified -rsb- . "
at least one supermarket chain is considering introducing " seal-friendly " salmon products , and several shoppers who were surprised to learn that seals were still regularly being shot told countryfile they would be willing to pay more for their salmon if they knew its farming had not caused the death of seals .
some fish farms are already experimenting with non-lethal methods of protecting their stocks by using nets made from stronger fibres or special acoustic devices to scare away hungry seals .
but it could be that the long-term future of seals could rest in the hands of politicians , with marine bills due to be debated in both the scottish and uk parliaments in the coming months .
