" what he is suggesting means that after the massacre people will have no access to food , kerosene and medicines that came through those tunnels .
that is not a ceasefire - that is a slow , agonizing death . " clashes with the police marred the end of last saturday 's demonstration in london and organizers had hoped for a more peaceful protest this time . lindsey german , convener of rally organizers the stop the war coalition , said : " we are calling for an end to the massacre and for israel to get out of gaza and palestine .

dov-ber kerler is part of the revival .
in a rabbinic sing-song , he recites stories from a lost world .
fourteen students from six different countries hang on his every word .
many take notes , most of them writing in hebrew letters .
they are students in the advanced class at the yiddish institute at the university of vilnius .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was another jewish ghetto outside kovno , lithuania learning the ' mother tongue ' one older student spent seven years in israel before returning to her home town .
in school , she had learned russian , the official language at the time .
but as a child , she had spoken yiddish exclusively , so she thought she would be able to speak it well .
but " when my parents died , i stopped speaking yiddish , " she says .
now , she says she realizes that she actually knows nothing at all .
it took the yiddish insitute to teach her her " mameloschn , " or mother tongue .
" many holocaust survivors tried to suppress their history , " says the acting director of the institute , ruta puisyte .
they wanted to fit into their new surroundings quickly .
now , their children or grandchildren find they want to learn more about their family history .
they want to ask questions and learn the language of their ancestors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many come to yiddish school in search of jewish roots discovering literature annika hillmann , a 25-year-old german literature student from hamburg , is the youngest person in the class .
her interest in yiddish is literary , not personal .
" it is so interesting for me .
by learning the language , not only did i discover an entire treasure trove of literature , but i developed an awareness of the history of east european jews , " she said .
the language course is well-situated .
the nearly 500 year old university in vilnius is on the edge of what was once the jewish ghetto in that town , where the nazis once herded together thousands of people .
' jerusalem of the north ' after the germans entered the city in 1941 , the ring of destruction around the once-blossoming jewish quarter of the city became ever tighter .
before world war ii , vilnius was known as " the jerusalem of the north . "
in september , 1943 the ghetto was finally " liquidated . "
whoever had n't fled by then was either driven out of town , shot , or gassed by ss troops and their lithuanian helpers .
fania brancovskaja , 86 , was one of those who fled at the last moment .
she joined the resistance group that was fighting the nazis - and later returned to her homeland .
now she is the institute 's librarian .
she tells her story in fluent yiddish , and leads students on tours of vilnius where they look for traces of a once-thriving jewish community .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli statesman chaim weizman was born in lithuania " yiddish school " mostly takes place in the mornings ; in the afternoons , th the students are free to go on excursions where they can discover the city 's jewish history .
there are courses in music , singing , dancing or literature tied to jewish culture .
" you get a completely different image of what yiddish once meant and perhaps - maybe a little - what it could become once more , " hillman says . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in all , at least 26 palestinians have been killed in clashes on sunday , medics said . an israeli military statement said the targets attacked included the house of the commander of the hamas military wing in the gaza strip .
it was unclear whether ahmed jabri was at home when his house was hit and whether he was wounded in the strike .
since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , hamas leaders have gone underground . other targets hit in the overnight strikes included , according to the israeli military , 10 hamas arms depots , 10 squads of armed gunmen , and nine tunnels under the gaza-egypt border used to smuggle weapons into the enclave , the statement said . israeli warplanes bombed about 60 targets throughout the gaza strip overnight , hitting weapon depots and smuggling tunnels as well as a mosque that was allegedly used to store weapons and train fighters , the army said . hamas says no dialogue while fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and islamic jihad will fight on , their leaders say with the body count spiraling , the exiled political chief of hamas , khaled meshaal , remained defiant , vowing in an address televised late saturday night the islamists would not negotiate " under fire . " branding the israeli operation a " holocaust , " meshaal said " the enemy has totally failed " and " created resistance in every house . " he once again ruled out a permanent truce with israel , a country his movement is pledged to destroying . " we will not accept a permanent truce because ... as long as there is an occupation there is a resistance , " he said , adding that his group will not hold talks on a temporary truce until israel stops its offensive . " we will not accept negotiations on a truce under fire , " he said .
israel had wrecked " the last chance for a settlement " with its assault on gaza . militants retaliate with increased rocket attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel came under rocket attack as its troops advanced hamas militants in the strip , for their part , continued launching rockets at southern israel , with two grad missiles hitting the city of beersheba .
hamas and its allies fired seven rockets into israel , with the projectiles slamming as far as 40 kilometers -lrb- 24 miles -rrb- inside the jewish state , without causing injuries . the missiles landed just as 11th graders and 12th graders in the city were returning to school , after a two-week suspension of classes because of the hamas rocket attacks . high school classes also resumed in other cities which have become frequent targets of hamas rockets , with most studies taking place in bomb shelters or in special protected buildings . since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , at least 879 people have been killed , including 275 children , and another 3,620 wounded , according to gaza medics . ten israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed in combat or in rocket attacks since the operation began , as palestinian militants have fired more than 600 rockets , some of them penetrating deeper than ever inside israel . as the two sides fought on , ignoring world pleas to stop the 16-day-old war that has killed more than 875 people , egypt was keeping up efforts to broker a truce in israel 's deadliest ever assault on the impoverished gaza strip . civilians continued to fall victim to israel 's onslaught on the palestinian enclave , one of the world 's most densely populated places where every other person of the 1.5 million population is under 18 years of age . two women and four children were killed in a strike on a house in beit lahiya , medics and witnesses said .
twelve bodies were pulled from the rubble in tal al-hawa , 10 of them fighters , medics said . israel closer to acieving its objectives : olmert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni and olmert say their objectives have almost been met prime minister ehud olmert said the jewish state is approaching the goals it had set for the offensive that it launched on december 27 in response to rocket fire , but said fighting will continue for the time being . " this is a time to translate our achievements into the goals we have set , " olmert said at the start of a cabinet meeting in jerusalem . " israel is approaching these goals , but more patience and determination are required in order to reach these goals " and " change the security reality in the south in a way that will allow our citizens to live in security and stability over a long period of time , " he said . defense minister ehud barak told reporters that israel is " examining the diplomatic channel " while continuing its offensive . " there 's no contradiction between the two , " said barak , who is due to again send senior aide amos gilad to cairo in coming days for egyptian-led talks on ending the war . egypt has been spearheading western-backed efforts to end the fighting , calling for an immediate truce , opening gaza 's border crossings , preventing arms smuggling and a call for palestinians to resume reconciliation talks . both hamas and israel have brushed aside a un security council resolution which last thursday called for an immediate truce in the territory . the conflict has sparked worldwide pro-palestinian demonstrations , including rallies in europe that drew tens of thousands of protesters . on sunday , 20,000 indonesian muslims rallied against the war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" gas shipments -lrb- from russia to europe via ukrainian pipelines -rrb- could begin as soon as all observers are on site at gas pumping station , " topolanek said , at a joint press conference with timoshenko .
" i think it could be 36 hours . " timoshenko was far more cautious , pointing out that the agreement signed early sunday morning in kiev " was very similar to an agreement -lrb- for observers -rrb- ukraine and the eu signed in brussels ... but that russia has not signed . " the terms agreed to by ukraine were " less severe " than as indicated in an agreement signed by topolanek and putin , timoshenko said . eu proposal terms accepted by moscow and kyiv alike stipulate russian and ukrainian observers may perform monitoring of gas shipments along with eu observers , and that the monitoring could take place along gas transport infrastructure in both russia and ukraine . location and movement of observers a sticking point the key difference in the terms concerned where observers would be permitted to do the monitoring , with ukraine accepting less freedom for the observers in ukraine than russia had demanded , timoshenko said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timoschenko said ukraine has been more lenient than russia " this point -lrb- observer access -rrb- was discussed in very great detail by ukraine , " timoshenko said .

" israel is approaching these goals , but more patience and determination are required in order to reach these goals " and " change the security reality in the south in a way that will allow our citizens to live in security and stability over a long period of time , " he said . defense minister ehud barak told reporters that israel is " examining the diplomatic channel " while continuing its offensive .

" gas shipments -lrb- from russia to europe via ukrainian pipelines -rrb- could begin as soon as all observers are on site at gas pumping station , " topolanek said , at a joint press conference with timoshenko .
" i think it could be 36 hours . " timoshenko was far more cautious , pointing out that the agreement signed early sunday morning in kiev " was very similar to an agreement -lrb- for observers -rrb- ukraine and the eu signed in brussels ... but that russia has not signed . " the terms agreed to by ukraine were " less severe " than as indicated in an agreement signed by topolanek and putin , timoshenko said . eu proposal terms accepted by moscow and kyiv alike stipulate russian and ukrainian observers may perform monitoring of gas shipments along with eu observers , and that the monitoring could take place along gas transport infrastructure in both russia and ukraine . location and movement of observers a sticking point the key difference in the terms concerned where observers would be permitted to do the monitoring , with ukraine accepting less freedom for the observers in ukraine than russia had demanded , timoshenko said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timoschenko said ukraine has been more lenient than russia " this point -lrb- observer access -rrb- was discussed in very great detail by ukraine , " timoshenko said .
" -lrb- ukraine has agreed to observer -rrb- access to gas reservoirs in ukraine , but only at those locations , that are critical to the stable transit of russian gas to europe .
-lrb- this is because -rrb- the russian side did not agree to monitoring of russian gas reservoirs . " russian officials led by prime minister vladimir putin have repeatedly accused ukraine of illicitly redirecting gas intended for europe into ukrainian underground reservoirs .
putin 's government throughout the embargo has demanded full and unhindered access to all ukrainian natural reservoirs to confirm the alleged siphoning . ukraine 's sunday refusal to accept full access for eu or russian observers of its entire underground gas reservoir system was a possible stumbling block for ending a russian embargo on natural gas shipments to europe begun on january 1 , observers said . observers to start work on sunday ; gas should follow putin on saturday afternoon said russia would begin full-scale shipments in europe as soon as independent observers were on the ground in ukraine . an advance party of the eu observer team arrived in kyiv on sunday , and was scheduled to perform inspections in the ukrainian of cities lviv , odessa and uzhgorod . it was not clear from details of the agreements made public , when all the observers - a group of some 18 technicians , according the eu statements - would be in place .
the team would likely operate " for something like a month , " timoshenko said . russia on saturday afternoon increased pressure in its gas pipeline system slightly , according to kremlin officials " as a gesture of good will , " some six hours before timoshenko and topolanek signed the observer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek reached an understanding with putin saturday full-scale russian gas flow would reach ukraine 's natural gas system some 24 hours after the kremlin ordered it , and ukraine would need some 48 hours to raise sufficient pressure in its gas transportation system to pass that gas volume onward to europe , according to energy officials in both countries . timoshenko raised another possible future point of contention with russia at the early sunday morning press conference , saying ukraine intended to use " technical gas " - gas held in the pipeline system to maintain pressure , rather than for delivery to customers - to return pressure in its pipeline system to pre-embargo levels , and further that ukraine would pay russia for the gas at pre-2009 prices . russian officials led by putin have been adamant that ukraine has long siphoned russian gas by manipulating pressure in the line , most recently during the early stages of the embargo . ukraine 's contention in early january that use of gazprom gas to maintain pressure in ukraine 's natural gas pipeline system was at the time rejected by russia outright . contract wrangle still resolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cause of the dispute still remains unresolved the eu observer agreement signed sunday also left wide open the main grounds for the russo-ukrainian natural gas dispute : the absence of a natural gas delivery contract between russia and ukraine for 2009 setting out the price of russian gas to be sold to ukraine , and the fee to be paid by russia for shipment of product via ukrainian pipelines to europe . conflict between kyiv and the kremlin over the two key pricing issues in late 2008 escalated to a total russian cut off of all gas sent into ukraine 's pipeline network , including gas earmarked for downstream european consumers . timoshenko said she expected " a memorandum on the gradual , proportional increase of the price of gas and its shipment ... in the near future . " russia and ukraine would continue negotiations to settle on pricing terms , and " i would like to believe they will be successful , " she said . europe buys roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , 80 percent of which is delivered to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in all , at least 26 palestinians have been killed in clashes on sunday , medics said . an israeli military statement said the targets attacked included the house of the commander of the hamas military wing in the gaza strip .
it was unclear whether ahmed jabri was at home when his house was hit and whether he was wounded in the strike .
since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , hamas leaders have gone underground . other targets hit in the overnight strikes included , according to the israeli military , 10 hamas arms depots , 10 squads of armed gunmen , and nine tunnels under the gaza-egypt border used to smuggle weapons into the enclave , the statement said . israeli warplanes bombed about 60 targets throughout the gaza strip overnight , hitting weapon depots and smuggling tunnels as well as a mosque that was allegedly used to store weapons and train fighters , the army said . hamas says no dialogue while fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and islamic jihad will fight on , their leaders say with the body count spiraling , the exiled political chief of hamas , khaled meshaal , remained defiant , vowing in an address televised late saturday night the islamists would not negotiate " under fire . " branding the israeli operation a " holocaust , " meshaal said " the enemy has totally failed " and " created resistance in every house . " he once again ruled out a permanent truce with israel , a country his movement is pledged to destroying .

in all , at least 26 palestinians have been killed in clashes on sunday , medics said . an israeli military statement said the targets attacked included the house of the commander of the hamas military wing in the gaza strip .
it was unclear whether ahmed jabri was at home when his house was hit and whether he was wounded in the strike .
since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , hamas leaders have gone underground . other targets hit in the overnight strikes included , according to the israeli military , 10 hamas arms depots , 10 squads of armed gunmen , and nine tunnels under the gaza-egypt border used to smuggle weapons into the enclave , the statement said . israeli warplanes bombed about 60 targets throughout the gaza strip overnight , hitting weapon depots and smuggling tunnels as well as a mosque that was allegedly used to store weapons and train fighters , the army said . hamas says no dialogue while fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and islamic jihad will fight on , their leaders say with the body count spiraling , the exiled political chief of hamas , khaled meshaal , remained defiant , vowing in an address televised late saturday night the islamists would not negotiate " under fire . " branding the israeli operation a " holocaust , " meshaal said " the enemy has totally failed " and " created resistance in every house . " he once again ruled out a permanent truce with israel , a country his movement is pledged to destroying .

" taxpayers can not be made to shoulder the burden , " he said . rupprecht heads the committee that oversees germany 's 480-billion euro -lrb- $ 670 billion -rrb- banking stabilization fund that was unveiled last october .
that amount includes a financial market stabilization fund of € 400 billion to guarantee loans and some € 80 billion to recapitalize the banking sector through the government taking stakes in banks . rupprecht 's voice joins those of several leading bankers who have called for the creation of just such a bank as a way to ease the credit crunch .
german financial institutions are still threatened with hundreds of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- of new asset write downs . if banks could get rid of bad assets and troubled loans , they might regain some of the confidence in one another that was shattered by the financial crisis .
that loss of trust has led to a squeeze on interbank lending and tighter credit for the economy overall . government wary but the german government has already rejected previous calls for creating a " bad bank , " saying there was " no need .

in all , at least 26 palestinians have been killed in clashes on sunday , medics said . an israeli military statement said the targets attacked included the house of the commander of the hamas military wing in the gaza strip .
it was unclear whether ahmed jabri was at home when his house was hit and whether he was wounded in the strike .
since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , hamas leaders have gone underground . other targets hit in the overnight strikes included , according to the israeli military , 10 hamas arms depots , 10 squads of armed gunmen , and nine tunnels under the gaza-egypt border used to smuggle weapons into the enclave , the statement said . israeli warplanes bombed about 60 targets throughout the gaza strip overnight , hitting weapon depots and smuggling tunnels as well as a mosque that was allegedly used to store weapons and train fighters , the army said . hamas says no dialogue while fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and islamic jihad will fight on , their leaders say with the body count spiraling , the exiled political chief of hamas , khaled meshaal , remained defiant , vowing in an address televised late saturday night the islamists would not negotiate " under fire . " branding the israeli operation a " holocaust , " meshaal said " the enemy has totally failed " and " created resistance in every house . " he once again ruled out a permanent truce with israel , a country his movement is pledged to destroying . " we will not accept a permanent truce because ... as long as there is an occupation there is a resistance , " he said , adding that his group will not hold talks on a temporary truce until israel stops its offensive . " we will not accept negotiations on a truce under fire , " he said .
israel had wrecked " the last chance for a settlement " with its assault on gaza . militants retaliate with increased rocket attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel came under rocket attack as its troops advanced hamas militants in the strip , for their part , continued launching rockets at southern israel , with two grad missiles hitting the city of beersheba .
hamas and its allies fired seven rockets into israel , with the projectiles slamming as far as 40 kilometers -lrb- 24 miles -rrb- inside the jewish state , without causing injuries . the missiles landed just as 11th graders and 12th graders in the city were returning to school , after a two-week suspension of classes because of the hamas rocket attacks . high school classes also resumed in other cities which have become frequent targets of hamas rockets , with most studies taking place in bomb shelters or in special protected buildings . since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , at least 879 people have been killed , including 275 children , and another 3,620 wounded , according to gaza medics . ten israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed in combat or in rocket attacks since the operation began , as palestinian militants have fired more than 600 rockets , some of them penetrating deeper than ever inside israel . as the two sides fought on , ignoring world pleas to stop the 16-day-old war that has killed more than 875 people , egypt was keeping up efforts to broker a truce in israel 's deadliest ever assault on the impoverished gaza strip . civilians continued to fall victim to israel 's onslaught on the palestinian enclave , one of the world 's most densely populated places where every other person of the 1.5 million population is under 18 years of age . two women and four children were killed in a strike on a house in beit lahiya , medics and witnesses said .
twelve bodies were pulled from the rubble in tal al-hawa , 10 of them fighters , medics said . israel closer to acieving its objectives : olmert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni and olmert say their objectives have almost been met prime minister ehud olmert said the jewish state is approaching the goals it had set for the offensive that it launched on december 27 in response to rocket fire , but said fighting will continue for the time being . " this is a time to translate our achievements into the goals we have set , " olmert said at the start of a cabinet meeting in jerusalem . " israel is approaching these goals , but more patience and determination are required in order to reach these goals " and " change the security reality in the south in a way that will allow our citizens to live in security and stability over a long period of time , " he said . defense minister ehud barak told reporters that israel is " examining the diplomatic channel " while continuing its offensive . " there 's no contradiction between the two , " said barak , who is due to again send senior aide amos gilad to cairo in coming days for egyptian-led talks on ending the war . egypt has been spearheading western-backed efforts to end the fighting , calling for an immediate truce , opening gaza 's border crossings , preventing arms smuggling and a call for palestinians to resume reconciliation talks . both hamas and israel have brushed aside a un security council resolution which last thursday called for an immediate truce in the territory . the conflict has sparked worldwide pro-palestinian demonstrations , including rallies in europe that drew tens of thousands of protesters . on sunday , 20,000 indonesian muslims rallied against the war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in all , at least 26 palestinians have been killed in clashes on sunday , medics said . an israeli military statement said the targets attacked included the house of the commander of the hamas military wing in the gaza strip .
it was unclear whether ahmed jabri was at home when his house was hit and whether he was wounded in the strike .
since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , hamas leaders have gone underground . other targets hit in the overnight strikes included , according to the israeli military , 10 hamas arms depots , 10 squads of armed gunmen , and nine tunnels under the gaza-egypt border used to smuggle weapons into the enclave , the statement said . israeli warplanes bombed about 60 targets throughout the gaza strip overnight , hitting weapon depots and smuggling tunnels as well as a mosque that was allegedly used to store weapons and train fighters , the army said . hamas says no dialogue while fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and islamic jihad will fight on , their leaders say with the body count spiraling , the exiled political chief of hamas , khaled meshaal , remained defiant , vowing in an address televised late saturday night the islamists would not negotiate " under fire . " branding the israeli operation a " holocaust , " meshaal said " the enemy has totally failed " and " created resistance in every house . " he once again ruled out a permanent truce with israel , a country his movement is pledged to destroying . " we will not accept a permanent truce because ... as long as there is an occupation there is a resistance , " he said , adding that his group will not hold talks on a temporary truce until israel stops its offensive . " we will not accept negotiations on a truce under fire , " he said .
israel had wrecked " the last chance for a settlement " with its assault on gaza . militants retaliate with increased rocket attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel came under rocket attack as its troops advanced hamas militants in the strip , for their part , continued launching rockets at southern israel , with two grad missiles hitting the city of beersheba .
hamas and its allies fired seven rockets into israel , with the projectiles slamming as far as 40 kilometers -lrb- 24 miles -rrb- inside the jewish state , without causing injuries . the missiles landed just as 11th graders and 12th graders in the city were returning to school , after a two-week suspension of classes because of the hamas rocket attacks . high school classes also resumed in other cities which have become frequent targets of hamas rockets , with most studies taking place in bomb shelters or in special protected buildings . since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , at least 879 people have been killed , including 275 children , and another 3,620 wounded , according to gaza medics . ten israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed in combat or in rocket attacks since the operation began , as palestinian militants have fired more than 600 rockets , some of them penetrating deeper than ever inside israel . as the two sides fought on , ignoring world pleas to stop the 16-day-old war that has killed more than 875 people , egypt was keeping up efforts to broker a truce in israel 's deadliest ever assault on the impoverished gaza strip . civilians continued to fall victim to israel 's onslaught on the palestinian enclave , one of the world 's most densely populated places where every other person of the 1.5 million population is under 18 years of age . two women and four children were killed in a strike on a house in beit lahiya , medics and witnesses said .
twelve bodies were pulled from the rubble in tal al-hawa , 10 of them fighters , medics said . israel closer to acieving its objectives : olmert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni and olmert say their objectives have almost been met prime minister ehud olmert said the jewish state is approaching the goals it had set for the offensive that it launched on december 27 in response to rocket fire , but said fighting will continue for the time being . " this is a time to translate our achievements into the goals we have set , " olmert said at the start of a cabinet meeting in jerusalem . " israel is approaching these goals , but more patience and determination are required in order to reach these goals " and " change the security reality in the south in a way that will allow our citizens to live in security and stability over a long period of time , " he said . defense minister ehud barak told reporters that israel is " examining the diplomatic channel " while continuing its offensive . " there 's no contradiction between the two , " said barak , who is due to again send senior aide amos gilad to cairo in coming days for egyptian-led talks on ending the war . egypt has been spearheading western-backed efforts to end the fighting , calling for an immediate truce , opening gaza 's border crossings , preventing arms smuggling and a call for palestinians to resume reconciliation talks . both hamas and israel have brushed aside a un security council resolution which last thursday called for an immediate truce in the territory . the conflict has sparked worldwide pro-palestinian demonstrations , including rallies in europe that drew tens of thousands of protesters . on sunday , 20,000 indonesian muslims rallied against the war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he once again ruled out a permanent truce with israel , a country his movement is pledged to destroying . " we will not accept a permanent truce because ... as long as there is an occupation there is a resistance , " he said , adding that his group will not hold talks on a temporary truce until israel stops its offensive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 11.01.2009 ukraine joins russia in agreeing eu deal but gas still on hold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both russia and ukraine has accepted the eu observer mission but the gas is still off ukraine joined russia to approve a european union initiative for international observers to monitor russian gas deliveries via ukraine , but differences still prevented the gas from flowing . despite the apparent breakthrough , kyiv ’ s and the kremlin 's interpretation of the agreement stood in the way of a quick end to a russian embargo on energy supplies to europe . ukrainian prime minister julia timoshenko signed the deal early sunday , after hours of nighttime talks with eu officials . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , arrived in ukraine late saturday evening hoping to obtain kyiv 's signature on the deal . russian prime minister vladimir putin signed off for the kremlin on the eu observer plan on saturday afternoon . " gas shipments -lrb- from russia to europe via ukrainian pipelines -rrb- could begin as soon as all observers are on site at gas pumping station , " topolanek said , at a joint press conference with timoshenko .
" i think it could be 36 hours . " timoshenko was far more cautious , pointing out that the agreement signed early sunday morning in kiev " was very similar to an agreement -lrb- for observers -rrb- ukraine and the eu signed in brussels ... but that russia has not signed . " the terms agreed to by ukraine were " less severe " than as indicated in an agreement signed by topolanek and putin , timoshenko said . eu proposal terms accepted by moscow and kyiv alike stipulate russian and ukrainian observers may perform monitoring of gas shipments along with eu observers , and that the monitoring could take place along gas transport infrastructure in both russia and ukraine . location and movement of observers a sticking point the key difference in the terms concerned where observers would be permitted to do the monitoring , with ukraine accepting less freedom for the observers in ukraine than russia had demanded , timoshenko said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timoschenko said ukraine has been more lenient than russia " this point -lrb- observer access -rrb- was discussed in very great detail by ukraine , " timoshenko said .
" -lrb- ukraine has agreed to observer -rrb- access to gas reservoirs in ukraine , but only at those locations , that are critical to the stable transit of russian gas to europe .
-lrb- this is because -rrb- the russian side did not agree to monitoring of russian gas reservoirs . " russian officials led by prime minister vladimir putin have repeatedly accused ukraine of illicitly redirecting gas intended for europe into ukrainian underground reservoirs .
putin 's government throughout the embargo has demanded full and unhindered access to all ukrainian natural reservoirs to confirm the alleged siphoning . ukraine 's sunday refusal to accept full access for eu or russian observers of its entire underground gas reservoir system was a possible stumbling block for ending a russian embargo on natural gas shipments to europe begun on january 1 , observers said . observers to start work on sunday ; gas should follow putin on saturday afternoon said russia would begin full-scale shipments in europe as soon as independent observers were on the ground in ukraine . an advance party of the eu observer team arrived in kyiv on sunday , and was scheduled to perform inspections in the ukrainian of cities lviv , odessa and uzhgorod . it was not clear from details of the agreements made public , when all the observers - a group of some 18 technicians , according the eu statements - would be in place .
the team would likely operate " for something like a month , " timoshenko said . russia on saturday afternoon increased pressure in its gas pipeline system slightly , according to kremlin officials " as a gesture of good will , " some six hours before timoshenko and topolanek signed the observer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek reached an understanding with putin saturday full-scale russian gas flow would reach ukraine 's natural gas system some 24 hours after the kremlin ordered it , and ukraine would need some 48 hours to raise sufficient pressure in its gas transportation system to pass that gas volume onward to europe , according to energy officials in both countries . timoshenko raised another possible future point of contention with russia at the early sunday morning press conference , saying ukraine intended to use " technical gas " - gas held in the pipeline system to maintain pressure , rather than for delivery to customers - to return pressure in its pipeline system to pre-embargo levels , and further that ukraine would pay russia for the gas at pre-2009 prices . russian officials led by putin have been adamant that ukraine has long siphoned russian gas by manipulating pressure in the line , most recently during the early stages of the embargo . ukraine 's contention in early january that use of gazprom gas to maintain pressure in ukraine 's natural gas pipeline system was at the time rejected by russia outright . contract wrangle still resolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cause of the dispute still remains unresolved the eu observer agreement signed sunday also left wide open the main grounds for the russo-ukrainian natural gas dispute : the absence of a natural gas delivery contract between russia and ukraine for 2009 setting out the price of russian gas to be sold to ukraine , and the fee to be paid by russia for shipment of product via ukrainian pipelines to europe . conflict between kyiv and the kremlin over the two key pricing issues in late 2008 escalated to a total russian cut off of all gas sent into ukraine 's pipeline network , including gas earmarked for downstream european consumers . timoshenko said she expected " a memorandum on the gradual , proportional increase of the price of gas and its shipment ... in the near future . " russia and ukraine would continue negotiations to settle on pricing terms , and " i would like to believe they will be successful , " she said . europe buys roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , 80 percent of which is delivered to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" gas shipments -lrb- from russia to europe via ukrainian pipelines -rrb- could begin as soon as all observers are on site at gas pumping station , " topolanek said , at a joint press conference with timoshenko .
" i think it could be 36 hours . " timoshenko was far more cautious , pointing out that the agreement signed early sunday morning in kiev " was very similar to an agreement -lrb- for observers -rrb- ukraine and the eu signed in brussels ... but that russia has not signed . " the terms agreed to by ukraine were " less severe " than as indicated in an agreement signed by topolanek and putin , timoshenko said . eu proposal terms accepted by moscow and kyiv alike stipulate russian and ukrainian observers may perform monitoring of gas shipments along with eu observers , and that the monitoring could take place along gas transport infrastructure in both russia and ukraine . location and movement of observers a sticking point the key difference in the terms concerned where observers would be permitted to do the monitoring , with ukraine accepting less freedom for the observers in ukraine than russia had demanded , timoshenko said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timoschenko said ukraine has been more lenient than russia " this point -lrb- observer access -rrb- was discussed in very great detail by ukraine , " timoshenko said .
" -lrb- ukraine has agreed to observer -rrb- access to gas reservoirs in ukraine , but only at those locations , that are critical to the stable transit of russian gas to europe .
-lrb- this is because -rrb- the russian side did not agree to monitoring of russian gas reservoirs . " russian officials led by prime minister vladimir putin have repeatedly accused ukraine of illicitly redirecting gas intended for europe into ukrainian underground reservoirs .
putin 's government throughout the embargo has demanded full and unhindered access to all ukrainian natural reservoirs to confirm the alleged siphoning . ukraine 's sunday refusal to accept full access for eu or russian observers of its entire underground gas reservoir system was a possible stumbling block for ending a russian embargo on natural gas shipments to europe begun on january 1 , observers said . observers to start work on sunday ; gas should follow putin on saturday afternoon said russia would begin full-scale shipments in europe as soon as independent observers were on the ground in ukraine . an advance party of the eu observer team arrived in kyiv on sunday , and was scheduled to perform inspections in the ukrainian of cities lviv , odessa and uzhgorod . it was not clear from details of the agreements made public , when all the observers - a group of some 18 technicians , according the eu statements - would be in place .
the team would likely operate " for something like a month , " timoshenko said . russia on saturday afternoon increased pressure in its gas pipeline system slightly , according to kremlin officials " as a gesture of good will , " some six hours before timoshenko and topolanek signed the observer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek reached an understanding with putin saturday full-scale russian gas flow would reach ukraine 's natural gas system some 24 hours after the kremlin ordered it , and ukraine would need some 48 hours to raise sufficient pressure in its gas transportation system to pass that gas volume onward to europe , according to energy officials in both countries . timoshenko raised another possible future point of contention with russia at the early sunday morning press conference , saying ukraine intended to use " technical gas " - gas held in the pipeline system to maintain pressure , rather than for delivery to customers - to return pressure in its pipeline system to pre-embargo levels , and further that ukraine would pay russia for the gas at pre-2009 prices . russian officials led by putin have been adamant that ukraine has long siphoned russian gas by manipulating pressure in the line , most recently during the early stages of the embargo . ukraine 's contention in early january that use of gazprom gas to maintain pressure in ukraine 's natural gas pipeline system was at the time rejected by russia outright . contract wrangle still resolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cause of the dispute still remains unresolved the eu observer agreement signed sunday also left wide open the main grounds for the russo-ukrainian natural gas dispute : the absence of a natural gas delivery contract between russia and ukraine for 2009 setting out the price of russian gas to be sold to ukraine , and the fee to be paid by russia for shipment of product via ukrainian pipelines to europe . conflict between kyiv and the kremlin over the two key pricing issues in late 2008 escalated to a total russian cut off of all gas sent into ukraine 's pipeline network , including gas earmarked for downstream european consumers . timoshenko said she expected " a memorandum on the gradual , proportional increase of the price of gas and its shipment ... in the near future .

in all , at least 26 palestinians have been killed in clashes on sunday , medics said . an israeli military statement said the targets attacked included the house of the commander of the hamas military wing in the gaza strip .
it was unclear whether ahmed jabri was at home when his house was hit and whether he was wounded in the strike .
since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , hamas leaders have gone underground . other targets hit in the overnight strikes included , according to the israeli military , 10 hamas arms depots , 10 squads of armed gunmen , and nine tunnels under the gaza-egypt border used to smuggle weapons into the enclave , the statement said . israeli warplanes bombed about 60 targets throughout the gaza strip overnight , hitting weapon depots and smuggling tunnels as well as a mosque that was allegedly used to store weapons and train fighters , the army said . hamas says no dialogue while fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and islamic jihad will fight on , their leaders say with the body count spiraling , the exiled political chief of hamas , khaled meshaal , remained defiant , vowing in an address televised late saturday night the islamists would not negotiate " under fire . " branding the israeli operation a " holocaust , " meshaal said " the enemy has totally failed " and " created resistance in every house . " he once again ruled out a permanent truce with israel , a country his movement is pledged to destroying . " we will not accept a permanent truce because ... as long as there is an occupation there is a resistance , " he said , adding that his group will not hold talks on a temporary truce until israel stops its offensive . " we will not accept negotiations on a truce under fire , " he said .
israel had wrecked " the last chance for a settlement " with its assault on gaza . militants retaliate with increased rocket attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel came under rocket attack as its troops advanced hamas militants in the strip , for their part , continued launching rockets at southern israel , with two grad missiles hitting the city of beersheba .
hamas and its allies fired seven rockets into israel , with the projectiles slamming as far as 40 kilometers -lrb- 24 miles -rrb- inside the jewish state , without causing injuries . the missiles landed just as 11th graders and 12th graders in the city were returning to school , after a two-week suspension of classes because of the hamas rocket attacks . high school classes also resumed in other cities which have become frequent targets of hamas rockets , with most studies taking place in bomb shelters or in special protected buildings . since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , at least 879 people have been killed , including 275 children , and another 3,620 wounded , according to gaza medics . ten israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed in combat or in rocket attacks since the operation began , as palestinian militants have fired more than 600 rockets , some of them penetrating deeper than ever inside israel . as the two sides fought on , ignoring world pleas to stop the 16-day-old war that has killed more than 875 people , egypt was keeping up efforts to broker a truce in israel 's deadliest ever assault on the impoverished gaza strip . civilians continued to fall victim to israel 's onslaught on the palestinian enclave , one of the world 's most densely populated places where every other person of the 1.5 million population is under 18 years of age . two women and four children were killed in a strike on a house in beit lahiya , medics and witnesses said .
twelve bodies were pulled from the rubble in tal al-hawa , 10 of them fighters , medics said . israel closer to acieving its objectives : olmert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni and olmert say their objectives have almost been met prime minister ehud olmert said the jewish state is approaching the goals it had set for the offensive that it launched on december 27 in response to rocket fire , but said fighting will continue for the time being . " this is a time to translate our achievements into the goals we have set , " olmert said at the start of a cabinet meeting in jerusalem . " israel is approaching these goals , but more patience and determination are required in order to reach these goals " and " change the security reality in the south in a way that will allow our citizens to live in security and stability over a long period of time , " he said . defense minister ehud barak told reporters that israel is " examining the diplomatic channel " while continuing its offensive . " there 's no contradiction between the two , " said barak , who is due to again send senior aide amos gilad to cairo in coming days for egyptian-led talks on ending the war . egypt has been spearheading western-backed efforts to end the fighting , calling for an immediate truce , opening gaza 's border crossings , preventing arms smuggling and a call for palestinians to resume reconciliation talks . both hamas and israel have brushed aside a un security council resolution which last thursday called for an immediate truce in the territory . the conflict has sparked worldwide pro-palestinian demonstrations , including rallies in europe that drew tens of thousands of protesters . on sunday , 20,000 indonesian muslims rallied against the war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" taxpayers can not be made to shoulder the burden , " he said . rupprecht heads the committee that oversees germany 's 480-billion euro -lrb- $ 670 billion -rrb- banking stabilization fund that was unveiled last october .
that amount includes a financial market stabilization fund of € 400 billion to guarantee loans and some € 80 billion to recapitalize the banking sector through the government taking stakes in banks . rupprecht 's voice joins those of several leading bankers who have called for the creation of just such a bank as a way to ease the credit crunch .
german financial institutions are still threatened with hundreds of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- of new asset write downs . if banks could get rid of bad assets and troubled loans , they might regain some of the confidence in one another that was shattered by the financial crisis .
that loss of trust has led to a squeeze on interbank lending and tighter credit for the economy overall . government wary but the german government has already rejected previous calls for creating a " bad bank , " saying there was " no need . " " we do n't see any urgent need to make a decision about this , " said deputy government spokesman thomas steg in december . the german government has " done its homework " in setting up a financial stabilization fund for banks , who are now responsible for making use of it , he said . but lending bankers say those guarantees distort competition in favor of banks that enjoy state-backed guarantees .
they say the guarantees can make conditions harder for those banks which have not needed the aid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are not here to blame .
we just want both sides to stop fighting on humanitarian grounds , " said christopher ma , a student at university of hong kong who initiated the protest with his classmate , felix lam . " we want hong kong people to know what is happening out there , " ma told reporters . elsewhere in asia , 20,000 indonesian muslims staged a peaceful rally sunday in the capital of jakarta .
protesters from the islamic prosperous justice party -lrb- pks -rrb- gathered at the national monument in jakarta and marched through the streets . further rallies will take place in some of europe 's major cities to denounce the 16-day-old offensive on the gaza strip , while a number of demonstrations in support of israel will also be held . the board of deputies of british jews gathered in london 's trafalgar square on sunday morning against hamas and to call for peace in israel and gaza . " our prayers at this time continue to be for a just and lasting peace for the people of the region , " chief rabbi jonathan sacks said in a statement . in the german cities of berlin , frankfurt and munich tens of thousands of people were expected to participate in similar pro-israeli demonstrations . meanwhile in brussels , trade unionists , pressure groups and political parties held a demonstration to call for an immediate ceasefire . in rome , over a thousand people formed a human chain from the jewish quarter of the italian capital to the local headquarters of the palestinian authority , the ansa news agency reported . pro-palestinian demonstrations were also expected to be held in madrid and berlin later sunday . london protests turn ugly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors and police clash outside the israeli embassy in london on saturday , the two biggest pro-palestinian protests took place in london and paris , with largely peaceful demonstrations in both capitals turning violent as the day wore on . angry demonstrators hurled missiles at riot police outside the israeli embassy in london on saturday as a protest against the jewish state 's offensive in the gaza strip turned ugly . demonstrators pushed over the barricades outside the embassy in kensington , west london , while a gang tried to force entry to the embassy road from the other end .
some threw sticks and stones at officers and police in riot gear and on horseback charged the crowd to keep them back , while protesters hurled a crash barrier through the window of a starbucks coffee shop . organizers hoped that 100,000 people would attend the rally , which began in hyde park before progressing to the israeli embassy .
an early police estimate put the crowd figure at 12,000 . one person was arrested for aggravated trespass at the embassy protest , a spokesman for london 's metropolitan police told reporters . celebrities and left-wing politicians addressed crowds in hyde park before marching to the israeli embassy . uk leftists show support for palestine demonstrators carried placards reading " stop the holocaust in gaza , " " freedom for palestine , " " gaza - stop the massacre , " " zionists equals nazis , " " a salute to the gallant fighters of hamas " and " jews against the war on gaza . " israel vowed to escalate its war in gaza on saturday as troops battled hamas fighters into a third week despite growing calls for a ceasefire as the death toll rose to 825 . newspaper columnist lauren booth , the sister-in-law of tony blair , the middle east quartet 's envoy , told the hyde park crowd : " tony blair 's only comment regarding the ceasefire has been to say that it can only take place after the tunnels in gaza are destroyed . " what he is suggesting means that after the massacre people will have no access to food , kerosene and medicines that came through those tunnels .
that is not a ceasefire - that is a slow , agonizing death . " clashes with the police marred the end of last saturday 's demonstration in london and organizers had hoped for a more peaceful protest this time . lindsey german , convener of rally organizers the stop the war coalition , said : " we are calling for an end to the massacre and for israel to get out of gaza and palestine . " we want the british government to take a much stronger position . " veteran left-wing campaigner tariq ali said beforehand : " the most appalling violence is happening in gaza - a few punch-ups outside the israeli embassy is neither here nor there . " in the scottish capital edinburgh , organizers said 10,000 people attended a rally , where around 300 shoes and red paint were hurled at the us consulate . organizers estimated that around 5,000 people marched through central belfast calling for an end to violence in the middle east .

seven police were hurt and 11 rioters arrested as youths broke off from a 2,500-strong crowd of protesters and smashed shop windows . widespread european demonstrations planned for sunday demonstrations took place on the streets of other european cities including athens , berlin , budapest , oslo , sarajevo and stockholm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is expected to host more protests on sunday in sarajevo , peace activist svetlana broz told a 1,000-strong pro-palestinian demonstration that the city knew better than others " what happens when the world remains silent at a time when innocent civilians suffer " , referring to the bloody siege of the city in the 1992-95 war in the former yugoslavia . police in oslo fired teargas after a small group among a crowd of 2,000 pelted them with stones , and up to 5,000 demonstrators gathered outside the israeli embassy in stockholm to call for an end to the military campaign . more than 6,000 people gathered for a peaceful rally in berlin , with similar shows of support for the palestinians in munich and cologne . in western germany , some 10,000 people , largely from the ethnic turkish community , protested in duisburg .

in all , at least 26 palestinians have been killed in clashes on sunday , medics said . an israeli military statement said the targets attacked included the house of the commander of the hamas military wing in the gaza strip .
it was unclear whether ahmed jabri was at home when his house was hit and whether he was wounded in the strike .
since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , hamas leaders have gone underground . other targets hit in the overnight strikes included , according to the israeli military , 10 hamas arms depots , 10 squads of armed gunmen , and nine tunnels under the gaza-egypt border used to smuggle weapons into the enclave , the statement said . israeli warplanes bombed about 60 targets throughout the gaza strip overnight , hitting weapon depots and smuggling tunnels as well as a mosque that was allegedly used to store weapons and train fighters , the army said . hamas says no dialogue while fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and islamic jihad will fight on , their leaders say with the body count spiraling , the exiled political chief of hamas , khaled meshaal , remained defiant , vowing in an address televised late saturday night the islamists would not negotiate " under fire . " branding the israeli operation a " holocaust , " meshaal said " the enemy has totally failed " and " created resistance in every house . " he once again ruled out a permanent truce with israel , a country his movement is pledged to destroying . " we will not accept a permanent truce because ... as long as there is an occupation there is a resistance , " he said , adding that his group will not hold talks on a temporary truce until israel stops its offensive . " we will not accept negotiations on a truce under fire , " he said .
israel had wrecked " the last chance for a settlement " with its assault on gaza . militants retaliate with increased rocket attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel came under rocket attack as its troops advanced hamas militants in the strip , for their part , continued launching rockets at southern israel , with two grad missiles hitting the city of beersheba .
hamas and its allies fired seven rockets into israel , with the projectiles slamming as far as 40 kilometers -lrb- 24 miles -rrb- inside the jewish state , without causing injuries . the missiles landed just as 11th graders and 12th graders in the city were returning to school , after a two-week suspension of classes because of the hamas rocket attacks . high school classes also resumed in other cities which have become frequent targets of hamas rockets , with most studies taking place in bomb shelters or in special protected buildings . since the israeli offensive began on december 27 , at least 879 people have been killed , including 275 children , and another 3,620 wounded , according to gaza medics . ten israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed in combat or in rocket attacks since the operation began , as palestinian militants have fired more than 600 rockets , some of them penetrating deeper than ever inside israel . as the two sides fought on , ignoring world pleas to stop the 16-day-old war that has killed more than 875 people , egypt was keeping up efforts to broker a truce in israel 's deadliest ever assault on the impoverished gaza strip . civilians continued to fall victim to israel 's onslaught on the palestinian enclave , one of the world 's most densely populated places where every other person of the 1.5 million population is under 18 years of age . two women and four children were killed in a strike on a house in beit lahiya , medics and witnesses said .
twelve bodies were pulled from the rubble in tal al-hawa , 10 of them fighters , medics said . israel closer to acieving its objectives : olmert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni and olmert say their objectives have almost been met prime minister ehud olmert said the jewish state is approaching the goals it had set for the offensive that it launched on december 27 in response to rocket fire , but said fighting will continue for the time being . " this is a time to translate our achievements into the goals we have set , " olmert said at the start of a cabinet meeting in jerusalem . " israel is approaching these goals , but more patience and determination are required in order to reach these goals " and " change the security reality in the south in a way that will allow our citizens to live in security and stability over a long period of time , " he said . defense minister ehud barak told reporters that israel is " examining the diplomatic channel " while continuing its offensive . " there 's no contradiction between the two , " said barak , who is due to again send senior aide amos gilad to cairo in coming days for egyptian-led talks on ending the war . egypt has been spearheading western-backed efforts to end the fighting , calling for an immediate truce , opening gaza 's border crossings , preventing arms smuggling and a call for palestinians to resume reconciliation talks . both hamas and israel have brushed aside a un security council resolution which last thursday called for an immediate truce in the territory . the conflict has sparked worldwide pro-palestinian demonstrations , including rallies in europe that drew tens of thousands of protesters . on sunday , 20,000 indonesian muslims rallied against the war . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" gas shipments -lrb- from russia to europe via ukrainian pipelines -rrb- could begin as soon as all observers are on site at gas pumping station , " topolanek said , at a joint press conference with timoshenko .
" i think it could be 36 hours . " timoshenko was far more cautious , pointing out that the agreement signed early sunday morning in kiev " was very similar to an agreement -lrb- for observers -rrb- ukraine and the eu signed in brussels ... but that russia has not signed . " the terms agreed to by ukraine were " less severe " than as indicated in an agreement signed by topolanek and putin , timoshenko said . eu proposal terms accepted by moscow and kyiv alike stipulate russian and ukrainian observers may perform monitoring of gas shipments along with eu observers , and that the monitoring could take place along gas transport infrastructure in both russia and ukraine . location and movement of observers a sticking point the key difference in the terms concerned where observers would be permitted to do the monitoring , with ukraine accepting less freedom for the observers in ukraine than russia had demanded , timoshenko said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timoschenko said ukraine has been more lenient than russia " this point -lrb- observer access -rrb- was discussed in very great detail by ukraine , " timoshenko said .
" -lrb- ukraine has agreed to observer -rrb- access to gas reservoirs in ukraine , but only at those locations , that are critical to the stable transit of russian gas to europe .
-lrb- this is because -rrb- the russian side did not agree to monitoring of russian gas reservoirs . " russian officials led by prime minister vladimir putin have repeatedly accused ukraine of illicitly redirecting gas intended for europe into ukrainian underground reservoirs .
putin 's government throughout the embargo has demanded full and unhindered access to all ukrainian natural reservoirs to confirm the alleged siphoning . ukraine 's sunday refusal to accept full access for eu or russian observers of its entire underground gas reservoir system was a possible stumbling block for ending a russian embargo on natural gas shipments to europe begun on january 1 , observers said . observers to start work on sunday ; gas should follow putin on saturday afternoon said russia would begin full-scale shipments in europe as soon as independent observers were on the ground in ukraine . an advance party of the eu observer team arrived in kyiv on sunday , and was scheduled to perform inspections in the ukrainian of cities lviv , odessa and uzhgorod . it was not clear from details of the agreements made public , when all the observers - a group of some 18 technicians , according the eu statements - would be in place .
the team would likely operate " for something like a month , " timoshenko said . russia on saturday afternoon increased pressure in its gas pipeline system slightly , according to kremlin officials " as a gesture of good will , " some six hours before timoshenko and topolanek signed the observer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek reached an understanding with putin saturday full-scale russian gas flow would reach ukraine 's natural gas system some 24 hours after the kremlin ordered it , and ukraine would need some 48 hours to raise sufficient pressure in its gas transportation system to pass that gas volume onward to europe , according to energy officials in both countries . timoshenko raised another possible future point of contention with russia at the early sunday morning press conference , saying ukraine intended to use " technical gas " - gas held in the pipeline system to maintain pressure , rather than for delivery to customers - to return pressure in its pipeline system to pre-embargo levels , and further that ukraine would pay russia for the gas at pre-2009 prices . russian officials led by putin have been adamant that ukraine has long siphoned russian gas by manipulating pressure in the line , most recently during the early stages of the embargo . ukraine 's contention in early january that use of gazprom gas to maintain pressure in ukraine 's natural gas pipeline system was at the time rejected by russia outright . contract wrangle still resolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cause of the dispute still remains unresolved the eu observer agreement signed sunday also left wide open the main grounds for the russo-ukrainian natural gas dispute : the absence of a natural gas delivery contract between russia and ukraine for 2009 setting out the price of russian gas to be sold to ukraine , and the fee to be paid by russia for shipment of product via ukrainian pipelines to europe . conflict between kyiv and the kremlin over the two key pricing issues in late 2008 escalated to a total russian cut off of all gas sent into ukraine 's pipeline network , including gas earmarked for downstream european consumers . timoshenko said she expected " a memorandum on the gradual , proportional increase of the price of gas and its shipment ... in the near future . " russia and ukraine would continue negotiations to settle on pricing terms , and " i would like to believe they will be successful , " she said . europe buys roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , 80 percent of which is delivered to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what he is suggesting means that after the massacre people will have no access to food , kerosene and medicines that came through those tunnels .
that is not a ceasefire - that is a slow , agonizing death . " clashes with the police marred the end of last saturday 's demonstration in london and organizers had hoped for a more peaceful protest this time . lindsey german , convener of rally organizers the stop the war coalition , said : " we are calling for an end to the massacre and for israel to get out of gaza and palestine .

" gas shipments -lrb- from russia to europe via ukrainian pipelines -rrb- could begin as soon as all observers are on site at gas pumping station , " topolanek said , at a joint press conference with timoshenko .
" i think it could be 36 hours . " timoshenko was far more cautious , pointing out that the agreement signed early sunday morning in kiev " was very similar to an agreement -lrb- for observers -rrb- ukraine and the eu signed in brussels ... but that russia has not signed . " the terms agreed to by ukraine were " less severe " than as indicated in an agreement signed by topolanek and putin , timoshenko said . eu proposal terms accepted by moscow and kyiv alike stipulate russian and ukrainian observers may perform monitoring of gas shipments along with eu observers , and that the monitoring could take place along gas transport infrastructure in both russia and ukraine . location and movement of observers a sticking point the key difference in the terms concerned where observers would be permitted to do the monitoring , with ukraine accepting less freedom for the observers in ukraine than russia had demanded , timoshenko said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timoschenko said ukraine has been more lenient than russia " this point -lrb- observer access -rrb- was discussed in very great detail by ukraine , " timoshenko said .
" -lrb- ukraine has agreed to observer -rrb- access to gas reservoirs in ukraine , but only at those locations , that are critical to the stable transit of russian gas to europe .
-lrb- this is because -rrb- the russian side did not agree to monitoring of russian gas reservoirs . " russian officials led by prime minister vladimir putin have repeatedly accused ukraine of illicitly redirecting gas intended for europe into ukrainian underground reservoirs .
putin 's government throughout the embargo has demanded full and unhindered access to all ukrainian natural reservoirs to confirm the alleged siphoning . ukraine 's sunday refusal to accept full access for eu or russian observers of its entire underground gas reservoir system was a possible stumbling block for ending a russian embargo on natural gas shipments to europe begun on january 1 , observers said . observers to start work on sunday ; gas should follow putin on saturday afternoon said russia would begin full-scale shipments in europe as soon as independent observers were on the ground in ukraine . an advance party of the eu observer team arrived in kyiv on sunday , and was scheduled to perform inspections in the ukrainian of cities lviv , odessa and uzhgorod . it was not clear from details of the agreements made public , when all the observers - a group of some 18 technicians , according the eu statements - would be in place .
the team would likely operate " for something like a month , " timoshenko said . russia on saturday afternoon increased pressure in its gas pipeline system slightly , according to kremlin officials " as a gesture of good will , " some six hours before timoshenko and topolanek signed the observer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek reached an understanding with putin saturday full-scale russian gas flow would reach ukraine 's natural gas system some 24 hours after the kremlin ordered it , and ukraine would need some 48 hours to raise sufficient pressure in its gas transportation system to pass that gas volume onward to europe , according to energy officials in both countries . timoshenko raised another possible future point of contention with russia at the early sunday morning press conference , saying ukraine intended to use " technical gas " - gas held in the pipeline system to maintain pressure , rather than for delivery to customers - to return pressure in its pipeline system to pre-embargo levels , and further that ukraine would pay russia for the gas at pre-2009 prices . russian officials led by putin have been adamant that ukraine has long siphoned russian gas by manipulating pressure in the line , most recently during the early stages of the embargo . ukraine 's contention in early january that use of gazprom gas to maintain pressure in ukraine 's natural gas pipeline system was at the time rejected by russia outright . contract wrangle still resolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cause of the dispute still remains unresolved the eu observer agreement signed sunday also left wide open the main grounds for the russo-ukrainian natural gas dispute : the absence of a natural gas delivery contract between russia and ukraine for 2009 setting out the price of russian gas to be sold to ukraine , and the fee to be paid by russia for shipment of product via ukrainian pipelines to europe . conflict between kyiv and the kremlin over the two key pricing issues in late 2008 escalated to a total russian cut off of all gas sent into ukraine 's pipeline network , including gas earmarked for downstream european consumers . timoshenko said she expected " a memorandum on the gradual , proportional increase of the price of gas and its shipment ... in the near future . " russia and ukraine would continue negotiations to settle on pricing terms , and " i would like to believe they will be successful , " she said . europe buys roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , 80 percent of which is delivered to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" taxpayers can not be made to shoulder the burden , " he said . rupprecht heads the committee that oversees germany 's 480-billion euro -lrb- $ 670 billion -rrb- banking stabilization fund that was unveiled last october .
that amount includes a financial market stabilization fund of € 400 billion to guarantee loans and some € 80 billion to recapitalize the banking sector through the government taking stakes in banks . rupprecht 's voice joins those of several leading bankers who have called for the creation of just such a bank as a way to ease the credit crunch .
german financial institutions are still threatened with hundreds of billions of euros -lrb- dollars -rrb- of new asset write downs . if banks could get rid of bad assets and troubled loans , they might regain some of the confidence in one another that was shattered by the financial crisis .
that loss of trust has led to a squeeze on interbank lending and tighter credit for the economy overall . government wary but the german government has already rejected previous calls for creating a " bad bank , " saying there was " no need . " " we do n't see any urgent need to make a decision about this , " said deputy government spokesman thomas steg in december . the german government has " done its homework " in setting up a financial stabilization fund for banks , who are now responsible for making use of it , he said . but lending bankers say those guarantees distort competition in favor of banks that enjoy state-backed guarantees .
they say the guarantees can make conditions harder for those banks which have not needed the aid . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" gas shipments -lrb- from russia to europe via ukrainian pipelines -rrb- could begin as soon as all observers are on site at gas pumping station , " topolanek said , at a joint press conference with timoshenko .
" i think it could be 36 hours . " timoshenko was far more cautious , pointing out that the agreement signed early sunday morning in kiev " was very similar to an agreement -lrb- for observers -rrb- ukraine and the eu signed in brussels ... but that russia has not signed . " the terms agreed to by ukraine were " less severe " than as indicated in an agreement signed by topolanek and putin , timoshenko said . eu proposal terms accepted by moscow and kyiv alike stipulate russian and ukrainian observers may perform monitoring of gas shipments along with eu observers , and that the monitoring could take place along gas transport infrastructure in both russia and ukraine . location and movement of observers a sticking point the key difference in the terms concerned where observers would be permitted to do the monitoring , with ukraine accepting less freedom for the observers in ukraine than russia had demanded , timoshenko said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timoschenko said ukraine has been more lenient than russia " this point -lrb- observer access -rrb- was discussed in very great detail by ukraine , " timoshenko said .
" -lrb- ukraine has agreed to observer -rrb- access to gas reservoirs in ukraine , but only at those locations , that are critical to the stable transit of russian gas to europe .
-lrb- this is because -rrb- the russian side did not agree to monitoring of russian gas reservoirs . " russian officials led by prime minister vladimir putin have repeatedly accused ukraine of illicitly redirecting gas intended for europe into ukrainian underground reservoirs .
putin 's government throughout the embargo has demanded full and unhindered access to all ukrainian natural reservoirs to confirm the alleged siphoning . ukraine 's sunday refusal to accept full access for eu or russian observers of its entire underground gas reservoir system was a possible stumbling block for ending a russian embargo on natural gas shipments to europe begun on january 1 , observers said . observers to start work on sunday ; gas should follow putin on saturday afternoon said russia would begin full-scale shipments in europe as soon as independent observers were on the ground in ukraine . an advance party of the eu observer team arrived in kyiv on sunday , and was scheduled to perform inspections in the ukrainian of cities lviv , odessa and uzhgorod . it was not clear from details of the agreements made public , when all the observers - a group of some 18 technicians , according the eu statements - would be in place .
the team would likely operate " for something like a month , " timoshenko said . russia on saturday afternoon increased pressure in its gas pipeline system slightly , according to kremlin officials " as a gesture of good will , " some six hours before timoshenko and topolanek signed the observer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek reached an understanding with putin saturday full-scale russian gas flow would reach ukraine 's natural gas system some 24 hours after the kremlin ordered it , and ukraine would need some 48 hours to raise sufficient pressure in its gas transportation system to pass that gas volume onward to europe , according to energy officials in both countries . timoshenko raised another possible future point of contention with russia at the early sunday morning press conference , saying ukraine intended to use " technical gas " - gas held in the pipeline system to maintain pressure , rather than for delivery to customers - to return pressure in its pipeline system to pre-embargo levels , and further that ukraine would pay russia for the gas at pre-2009 prices . russian officials led by putin have been adamant that ukraine has long siphoned russian gas by manipulating pressure in the line , most recently during the early stages of the embargo . ukraine 's contention in early january that use of gazprom gas to maintain pressure in ukraine 's natural gas pipeline system was at the time rejected by russia outright . contract wrangle still resolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cause of the dispute still remains unresolved the eu observer agreement signed sunday also left wide open the main grounds for the russo-ukrainian natural gas dispute : the absence of a natural gas delivery contract between russia and ukraine for 2009 setting out the price of russian gas to be sold to ukraine , and the fee to be paid by russia for shipment of product via ukrainian pipelines to europe . conflict between kyiv and the kremlin over the two key pricing issues in late 2008 escalated to a total russian cut off of all gas sent into ukraine 's pipeline network , including gas earmarked for downstream european consumers . timoshenko said she expected " a memorandum on the gradual , proportional increase of the price of gas and its shipment ... in the near future . " russia and ukraine would continue negotiations to settle on pricing terms , and " i would like to believe they will be successful , " she said . europe buys roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , 80 percent of which is delivered to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are not here to blame .
we just want both sides to stop fighting on humanitarian grounds , " said christopher ma , a student at university of hong kong who initiated the protest with his classmate , felix lam . " we want hong kong people to know what is happening out there , " ma told reporters . elsewhere in asia , 20,000 indonesian muslims staged a peaceful rally sunday in the capital of jakarta .
protesters from the islamic prosperous justice party -lrb- pks -rrb- gathered at the national monument in jakarta and marched through the streets . further rallies will take place in some of europe 's major cities to denounce the 16-day-old offensive on the gaza strip , while a number of demonstrations in support of israel will also be held . the board of deputies of british jews gathered in london 's trafalgar square on sunday morning against hamas and to call for peace in israel and gaza . " our prayers at this time continue to be for a just and lasting peace for the people of the region , " chief rabbi jonathan sacks said in a statement . in the german cities of berlin , frankfurt and munich tens of thousands of people were expected to participate in similar pro-israeli demonstrations . meanwhile in brussels , trade unionists , pressure groups and political parties held a demonstration to call for an immediate ceasefire . in rome , over a thousand people formed a human chain from the jewish quarter of the italian capital to the local headquarters of the palestinian authority , the ansa news agency reported . pro-palestinian demonstrations were also expected to be held in madrid and berlin later sunday . london protests turn ugly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors and police clash outside the israeli embassy in london on saturday , the two biggest pro-palestinian protests took place in london and paris , with largely peaceful demonstrations in both capitals turning violent as the day wore on . angry demonstrators hurled missiles at riot police outside the israeli embassy in london on saturday as a protest against the jewish state 's offensive in the gaza strip turned ugly . demonstrators pushed over the barricades outside the embassy in kensington , west london , while a gang tried to force entry to the embassy road from the other end .
some threw sticks and stones at officers and police in riot gear and on horseback charged the crowd to keep them back , while protesters hurled a crash barrier through the window of a starbucks coffee shop . organizers hoped that 100,000 people would attend the rally , which began in hyde park before progressing to the israeli embassy .
an early police estimate put the crowd figure at 12,000 . one person was arrested for aggravated trespass at the embassy protest , a spokesman for london 's metropolitan police told reporters . celebrities and left-wing politicians addressed crowds in hyde park before marching to the israeli embassy . uk leftists show support for palestine demonstrators carried placards reading " stop the holocaust in gaza , " " freedom for palestine , " " gaza - stop the massacre , " " zionists equals nazis , " " a salute to the gallant fighters of hamas " and " jews against the war on gaza . " israel vowed to escalate its war in gaza on saturday as troops battled hamas fighters into a third week despite growing calls for a ceasefire as the death toll rose to 825 . newspaper columnist lauren booth , the sister-in-law of tony blair , the middle east quartet 's envoy , told the hyde park crowd : " tony blair 's only comment regarding the ceasefire has been to say that it can only take place after the tunnels in gaza are destroyed .

" gas shipments -lrb- from russia to europe via ukrainian pipelines -rrb- could begin as soon as all observers are on site at gas pumping station , " topolanek said , at a joint press conference with timoshenko .
" i think it could be 36 hours . " timoshenko was far more cautious , pointing out that the agreement signed early sunday morning in kiev " was very similar to an agreement -lrb- for observers -rrb- ukraine and the eu signed in brussels ... but that russia has not signed . " the terms agreed to by ukraine were " less severe " than as indicated in an agreement signed by topolanek and putin , timoshenko said . eu proposal terms accepted by moscow and kyiv alike stipulate russian and ukrainian observers may perform monitoring of gas shipments along with eu observers , and that the monitoring could take place along gas transport infrastructure in both russia and ukraine . location and movement of observers a sticking point the key difference in the terms concerned where observers would be permitted to do the monitoring , with ukraine accepting less freedom for the observers in ukraine than russia had demanded , timoshenko said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timoschenko said ukraine has been more lenient than russia " this point -lrb- observer access -rrb- was discussed in very great detail by ukraine , " timoshenko said .
" -lrb- ukraine has agreed to observer -rrb- access to gas reservoirs in ukraine , but only at those locations , that are critical to the stable transit of russian gas to europe .
-lrb- this is because -rrb- the russian side did not agree to monitoring of russian gas reservoirs . " russian officials led by prime minister vladimir putin have repeatedly accused ukraine of illicitly redirecting gas intended for europe into ukrainian underground reservoirs .
putin 's government throughout the embargo has demanded full and unhindered access to all ukrainian natural reservoirs to confirm the alleged siphoning . ukraine 's sunday refusal to accept full access for eu or russian observers of its entire underground gas reservoir system was a possible stumbling block for ending a russian embargo on natural gas shipments to europe begun on january 1 , observers said . observers to start work on sunday ; gas should follow putin on saturday afternoon said russia would begin full-scale shipments in europe as soon as independent observers were on the ground in ukraine . an advance party of the eu observer team arrived in kyiv on sunday , and was scheduled to perform inspections in the ukrainian of cities lviv , odessa and uzhgorod . it was not clear from details of the agreements made public , when all the observers - a group of some 18 technicians , according the eu statements - would be in place .
the team would likely operate " for something like a month , " timoshenko said . russia on saturday afternoon increased pressure in its gas pipeline system slightly , according to kremlin officials " as a gesture of good will , " some six hours before timoshenko and topolanek signed the observer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek reached an understanding with putin saturday full-scale russian gas flow would reach ukraine 's natural gas system some 24 hours after the kremlin ordered it , and ukraine would need some 48 hours to raise sufficient pressure in its gas transportation system to pass that gas volume onward to europe , according to energy officials in both countries . timoshenko raised another possible future point of contention with russia at the early sunday morning press conference , saying ukraine intended to use " technical gas " - gas held in the pipeline system to maintain pressure , rather than for delivery to customers - to return pressure in its pipeline system to pre-embargo levels , and further that ukraine would pay russia for the gas at pre-2009 prices . russian officials led by putin have been adamant that ukraine has long siphoned russian gas by manipulating pressure in the line , most recently during the early stages of the embargo . ukraine 's contention in early january that use of gazprom gas to maintain pressure in ukraine 's natural gas pipeline system was at the time rejected by russia outright . contract wrangle still resolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cause of the dispute still remains unresolved the eu observer agreement signed sunday also left wide open the main grounds for the russo-ukrainian natural gas dispute : the absence of a natural gas delivery contract between russia and ukraine for 2009 setting out the price of russian gas to be sold to ukraine , and the fee to be paid by russia for shipment of product via ukrainian pipelines to europe . conflict between kyiv and the kremlin over the two key pricing issues in late 2008 escalated to a total russian cut off of all gas sent into ukraine 's pipeline network , including gas earmarked for downstream european consumers . timoshenko said she expected " a memorandum on the gradual , proportional increase of the price of gas and its shipment ... in the near future . " russia and ukraine would continue negotiations to settle on pricing terms , and " i would like to believe they will be successful , " she said . europe buys roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , 80 percent of which is delivered to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" gas shipments -lrb- from russia to europe via ukrainian pipelines -rrb- could begin as soon as all observers are on site at gas pumping station , " topolanek said , at a joint press conference with timoshenko .
" i think it could be 36 hours . " timoshenko was far more cautious , pointing out that the agreement signed early sunday morning in kiev " was very similar to an agreement -lrb- for observers -rrb- ukraine and the eu signed in brussels ... but that russia has not signed . " the terms agreed to by ukraine were " less severe " than as indicated in an agreement signed by topolanek and putin , timoshenko said . eu proposal terms accepted by moscow and kyiv alike stipulate russian and ukrainian observers may perform monitoring of gas shipments along with eu observers , and that the monitoring could take place along gas transport infrastructure in both russia and ukraine . location and movement of observers a sticking point the key difference in the terms concerned where observers would be permitted to do the monitoring , with ukraine accepting less freedom for the observers in ukraine than russia had demanded , timoshenko said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timoschenko said ukraine has been more lenient than russia " this point -lrb- observer access -rrb- was discussed in very great detail by ukraine , " timoshenko said .
" -lrb- ukraine has agreed to observer -rrb- access to gas reservoirs in ukraine , but only at those locations , that are critical to the stable transit of russian gas to europe .
-lrb- this is because -rrb- the russian side did not agree to monitoring of russian gas reservoirs . " russian officials led by prime minister vladimir putin have repeatedly accused ukraine of illicitly redirecting gas intended for europe into ukrainian underground reservoirs .
putin 's government throughout the embargo has demanded full and unhindered access to all ukrainian natural reservoirs to confirm the alleged siphoning . ukraine 's sunday refusal to accept full access for eu or russian observers of its entire underground gas reservoir system was a possible stumbling block for ending a russian embargo on natural gas shipments to europe begun on january 1 , observers said . observers to start work on sunday ; gas should follow putin on saturday afternoon said russia would begin full-scale shipments in europe as soon as independent observers were on the ground in ukraine . an advance party of the eu observer team arrived in kyiv on sunday , and was scheduled to perform inspections in the ukrainian of cities lviv , odessa and uzhgorod . it was not clear from details of the agreements made public , when all the observers - a group of some 18 technicians , according the eu statements - would be in place .
the team would likely operate " for something like a month , " timoshenko said . russia on saturday afternoon increased pressure in its gas pipeline system slightly , according to kremlin officials " as a gesture of good will , " some six hours before timoshenko and topolanek signed the observer agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : topolanek reached an understanding with putin saturday full-scale russian gas flow would reach ukraine 's natural gas system some 24 hours after the kremlin ordered it , and ukraine would need some 48 hours to raise sufficient pressure in its gas transportation system to pass that gas volume onward to europe , according to energy officials in both countries . timoshenko raised another possible future point of contention with russia at the early sunday morning press conference , saying ukraine intended to use " technical gas " - gas held in the pipeline system to maintain pressure , rather than for delivery to customers - to return pressure in its pipeline system to pre-embargo levels , and further that ukraine would pay russia for the gas at pre-2009 prices . russian officials led by putin have been adamant that ukraine has long siphoned russian gas by manipulating pressure in the line , most recently during the early stages of the embargo . ukraine 's contention in early january that use of gazprom gas to maintain pressure in ukraine 's natural gas pipeline system was at the time rejected by russia outright . contract wrangle still resolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cause of the dispute still remains unresolved the eu observer agreement signed sunday also left wide open the main grounds for the russo-ukrainian natural gas dispute : the absence of a natural gas delivery contract between russia and ukraine for 2009 setting out the price of russian gas to be sold to ukraine , and the fee to be paid by russia for shipment of product via ukrainian pipelines to europe . conflict between kyiv and the kremlin over the two key pricing issues in late 2008 escalated to a total russian cut off of all gas sent into ukraine 's pipeline network , including gas earmarked for downstream european consumers . timoshenko said she expected " a memorandum on the gradual , proportional increase of the price of gas and its shipment ... in the near future . " russia and ukraine would continue negotiations to settle on pricing terms , and " i would like to believe they will be successful , " she said . europe buys roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from russia , 80 percent of which is delivered to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal was signed by ukrainian pm yulia tymoshenko , russian pm vladimir putin and czech pm mirek topolanek .
the deal is aimed at enabling a resumption of russian gas deliveries to european countries through ukraine .
hundreds of thousands of european homes have no heating after gas shipments via ukraine were halted on wednesday .
although both ukraine and russia had guaranteed that transit routes to europe would be unaffected , mutual accusations between kiev and moscow resulted in supplies being cut .
eu monitors were expected to set out early from kiev early on sunday for the pumping and measuring stations on ukraine 's eastern and western borders .
if things go to plan and once those monitors are in place , says the bbc 's gabriel gatehouse in kiev , russia should turn on the taps .
' calming russian fears ' mr topolanek , who has been in ukraine for talks with ms tymoshenko , said the signing of the deal cleared the way for the resumption of russian natural gas supplies to europe .
" nothing prevents russia now from resuming gas supplies , " he said .
ukraine 's pm met the eu envoy on saturday evening russia 's agreement came after five hours of talks between russian deputy prime minister igor sechin and officials from the european union .
under the deal , eu , ukrainian and russian observers will monitor supplies , in order to calm russian fears that ukraine is siphoning off gas for its own use .
ukraine has denied this allegation .
after signing the deal , ms tymoshenko said ukraine 's agreement signified its " goodwill " and role as an " honest transit country " , the associated press reported .
mr putin is quoted on interfax , the russian news agency , as saying that the " transit of gas through ukraine will start again as soon as the -lrb- transit -rrb- control mechanism starts to work " .
ukraine and russia 's bitter contractual dispute over gas prices and transit fees has affected several countries which are unlikely to have supply resumed before monday at the earliest , despite the signing of this deal .
normal service in affected countries such as bulgaria , slovakia , bosnia-hercegovina and serbia will be delayed as it takes around 36 hours from the moment of turning on the taps for the gas to reach consumers , our correspondent adds .
bitter dispute but the underlying issue that caused this crisis - how much ukraine should pay russia for its gas , and what russia should pay ukraine in return for transporting gas to europe - remains unresolved .
talks on the sale of russian gas to ukraine ended without an agreement on saturday .
gazprom 's offer price of $ 450 per 1,000 cubic metres was more than double the $ 201 ukraine was prepared to accept , said oleh dubyna , chief executive of ukrainian state energy company naftogaz .
ukraine paid $ 179.5 in 2008 .
slovakia to restart nuclear plant send us your comments russia cut supplies to the ukraine on new year 's day .
" unfortunately , the talks with gazprom have finished with nothing , " he said .
" the talks now have to proceed at a higher level . "
until this element gas dispute is resolved , our correspondent says , there is no guarantee there will not be a repeat of what has been europe 's worst energy crisis for years .
the eu gets a quarter of its gas supplies from russia , 80 % of which passes through ukraine and more than 15 countries across central europe have been hit by the shutdown of russian supplies .
serbia and bosnia-hercegovina are among the worst hit as many homes rely on heating stations that only run on gas .
meanwhile , the slovak government has decided to restart a nuclear power station because of the gas supply cuts , prime minister robert fico said .

the deal was signed by ukrainian pm yulia tymoshenko , russian pm vladimir putin and czech pm mirek topolanek .
the deal is aimed at enabling a resumption of russian gas deliveries to european countries through ukraine .
hundreds of thousands of european homes have no heating after gas shipments via ukraine were halted on wednesday .
although both ukraine and russia had guaranteed that transit routes to europe would be unaffected , mutual accusations between kiev and moscow resulted in supplies being cut .
eu monitors were expected to set out early from kiev early on sunday for the pumping and measuring stations on ukraine 's eastern and western borders .
if things go to plan and once those monitors are in place , says the bbc 's gabriel gatehouse in kiev , russia should turn on the taps .
' calming russian fears ' mr topolanek , who has been in ukraine for talks with ms tymoshenko , said the signing of the deal cleared the way for the resumption of russian natural gas supplies to europe .
" nothing prevents russia now from resuming gas supplies , " he said .
ukraine 's pm met the eu envoy on saturday evening russia 's agreement came after five hours of talks between russian deputy prime minister igor sechin and officials from the european union .
under the deal , eu , ukrainian and russian observers will monitor supplies , in order to calm russian fears that ukraine is siphoning off gas for its own use .
ukraine has denied this allegation .
after signing the deal , ms tymoshenko said ukraine 's agreement signified its " goodwill " and role as an " honest transit country " , the associated press reported .
mr putin is quoted on interfax , the russian news agency , as saying that the " transit of gas through ukraine will start again as soon as the -lrb- transit -rrb- control mechanism starts to work " .
ukraine and russia 's bitter contractual dispute over gas prices and transit fees has affected several countries which are unlikely to have supply resumed before monday at the earliest , despite the signing of this deal .
normal service in affected countries such as bulgaria , slovakia , bosnia-hercegovina and serbia will be delayed as it takes around 36 hours from the moment of turning on the taps for the gas to reach consumers , our correspondent adds .
bitter dispute but the underlying issue that caused this crisis - how much ukraine should pay russia for its gas , and what russia should pay ukraine in return for transporting gas to europe - remains unresolved .
talks on the sale of russian gas to ukraine ended without an agreement on saturday .
gazprom 's offer price of $ 450 per 1,000 cubic metres was more than double the $ 201 ukraine was prepared to accept , said oleh dubyna , chief executive of ukrainian state energy company naftogaz .
ukraine paid $ 179.5 in 2008 .
slovakia to restart nuclear plant send us your comments russia cut supplies to the ukraine on new year 's day .
" unfortunately , the talks with gazprom have finished with nothing , " he said .
" the talks now have to proceed at a higher level . "
until this element gas dispute is resolved , our correspondent says , there is no guarantee there will not be a repeat of what has been europe 's worst energy crisis for years .
the eu gets a quarter of its gas supplies from russia , 80 % of which passes through ukraine and more than 15 countries across central europe have been hit by the shutdown of russian supplies .
serbia and bosnia-hercegovina are among the worst hit as many homes rely on heating stations that only run on gas .
meanwhile , the slovak government has decided to restart a nuclear power station because of the gas supply cuts , prime minister robert fico said .
slovakia shut the jaslovske bohunice power station at the end of last year in order to comply with its eu accession agreement .

ukraine 's pm met the eu envoy on saturday evening russia 's agreement came after five hours of talks between russian deputy prime minister igor sechin and officials from the european union .
under the deal , eu , ukrainian and russian observers will monitor supplies , in order to calm russian fears that ukraine is siphoning off gas for its own use .
ukraine has denied this allegation .
after signing the deal , ms tymoshenko said ukraine 's agreement signified its " goodwill " and role as an " honest transit country " , the associated press reported .
mr putin is quoted on interfax , the russian news agency , as saying that the " transit of gas through ukraine will start again as soon as the -lrb- transit -rrb- control mechanism starts to work " .
ukraine and russia 's bitter contractual dispute over gas prices and transit fees has affected several countries which are unlikely to have supply resumed before monday at the earliest , despite the signing of this deal .
normal service in affected countries such as bulgaria , slovakia , bosnia-hercegovina and serbia will be delayed as it takes around 36 hours from the moment of turning on the taps for the gas to reach consumers , our correspondent adds .
bitter dispute but the underlying issue that caused this crisis - how much ukraine should pay russia for its gas , and what russia should pay ukraine in return for transporting gas to europe - remains unresolved .
talks on the sale of russian gas to ukraine ended without an agreement on saturday .
gazprom 's offer price of $ 450 per 1,000 cubic metres was more than double the $ 201 ukraine was prepared to accept , said oleh dubyna , chief executive of ukrainian state energy company naftogaz .
ukraine paid $ 179.5 in 2008 .
slovakia to restart nuclear plant send us your comments russia cut supplies to the ukraine on new year 's day .
" unfortunately , the talks with gazprom have finished with nothing , " he said .
" the talks now have to proceed at a higher level . "
until this element gas dispute is resolved , our correspondent says , there is no guarantee there will not be a repeat of what has been europe 's worst energy crisis for years .
the eu gets a quarter of its gas supplies from russia , 80 % of which passes through ukraine and more than 15 countries across central europe have been hit by the shutdown of russian supplies .
serbia and bosnia-hercegovina are among the worst hit as many homes rely on heating stations that only run on gas .
meanwhile , the slovak government has decided to restart a nuclear power station because of the gas supply cuts , prime minister robert fico said .
slovakia shut the jaslovske bohunice power station at the end of last year in order to comply with its eu accession agreement .

the deal was signed by ukrainian pm yulia tymoshenko , russian pm vladimir putin and czech pm mirek topolanek .
the deal is aimed at enabling a resumption of russian gas deliveries to european countries through ukraine .
hundreds of thousands of european homes have no heating after gas shipments via ukraine were halted on wednesday .
although both ukraine and russia had guaranteed that transit routes to europe would be unaffected , mutual accusations between kiev and moscow resulted in supplies being cut .
eu monitors were expected to set out early from kiev early on sunday for the pumping and measuring stations on ukraine 's eastern and western borders .
if things go to plan and once those monitors are in place , says the bbc 's gabriel gatehouse in kiev , russia should turn on the taps .
' calming russian fears ' mr topolanek , who has been in ukraine for talks with ms tymoshenko , said the signing of the deal cleared the way for the resumption of russian natural gas supplies to europe .
" nothing prevents russia now from resuming gas supplies , " he said .

adrian nielsen , 63 , from swansea , says his eyes became bloodshot , watery and uncomfortable after fitting energy-efficient bulbs throughout his home .
he fears other people could have similar problems .
the department for food , environment and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said it was looking into " anecdotal evidence " about adverse reactions .
retailers have agreed to phase out the incandescent bulbs by 2012 in favour of more energy-efficient bulbs - ahead of the eu mandatory phase out by 2016 .
the migraine action association is among those calling for a rethink of the plan and for people to be given a choice .
it says those with the condition can suffer attacks because of a " flicker " in the new fluorescent bulbs which is imperceptible to others .
it is a call company director mr neilsen is backing .
he said his eye problems began after fitting the new light bulbs throughout his home .
" all of sudden , and i 'm not really sure over what time period it was , my eyes were getting watery , " said mr neisen , who had laser treatment to correct short sightedness in 2000 but had never had any other problems with his eyes .
" they were very sore and bloodshot .
it was to the extent that i was blinking continuously .
it was like i had bits of sand in there . "
energy efficient light bulbs are not a danger to the public defra after around six weeks , he went to the doctor , who said he was probably suffering from conjunctivitis .
but despite being given medication , the problem did not go away and after returning to the doctor a week later he was told he could have dry eyes .
the irritation continued until a few days later when he went on holiday .
" all the time we were out in crete my eyes were absolutely perfect , " said mr neilsen .
" for them to clear up completely while i was away just did not add up .
but when we came back it started again . "
he said he came across a newspaper story about a woman who had the same problems until she changed her light bulbs back to the older type .
mr neilsen did the same thing .
" literally within hours my eyes were clear again , " he said .
" i had not thought it was the lights .
" since then i notice what lights people have got .
" in the pub they have them .
if i 'm in there an hour my eyes start .
i 've gone to businesses where they have this new lighting and i 've sat there and all of a sudden they will go again .
" i think the problem is to do with the pulse that comes out of the fluorescent light . "
he added : " looking long-term if they have these everywhere i 've got problems . "
a spokeswoman for the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said low energy light bulbs are a " great way to help the environment and save money " .
she said : " energy efficient light bulbs are not a danger to the public .
" we are aware of some anecdotal evidence that the use of these bulbs could have adverse effects on some people 's health and are working with the lighting industry and the department of health to resolve these issues .
" it 's worth noting that the new generation of energy efficient bulbs operate on a higher frequency than earlier models , which means a constant , flicker-free light . "

the department for food , environment and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said it was looking into " anecdotal evidence " about adverse reactions .
retailers have agreed to phase out the incandescent bulbs by 2012 in favour of more energy-efficient bulbs - ahead of the eu mandatory phase out by 2016 .

westminster last week rejected the snp 's plan to borrow money from future budgets to fund the £ 2bn bridge , paying it back over 20 years .
mr murphy said it was important to make progress on the issue .
it comes as the scottish government produced a list of bodies which support its call for full borrowing powers .
the uk treasury rejected the request to borrow from future budgets as " not a credible option " .
mr murphy said he thought progress could be made and has invited both sides to meet on 27 january .
he said : " i 'm inviting the snp government and the treasury to talks despite the way in which the snp 's played politics with this .
the sums do n't add up .
they are trying to borrow money against budgets that do n't even yet exist over a period of two decades .
" but despite the fact the snp sums do n't add up , it is important that we do make progress which is why i 'm inviting them to these talks .
because it is important that we build this new forth crossing , we want the right crossing at the right price .
i think we can make progress . "
finance secretary john swinney said he was delighted about the meetings but was in no doubt that about the right way forward .
he said : " the sensible way to proceed is to undertake this bridge project under traditional government procurement and we 've got the money to pay for that in our capital budgets .
" what 's important is that we have a sensible and constructive discussion with the treasury about spreading the cost of the bridge over a number of years to ensure that we can support other capital projects at the same time .
i 'd be delighted to discuss that issue with the treasury because it reflects a sensible way forward . "
borrowing powers the stuc , the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy and former labour first minister henry mcleish have added their names to a list of public bodies who support the scottish government 's call for full borrowing powers .
a spokesman for first minister alex salmond said : " if we have responsibility for major issues such as funding a new forth bridge - the biggest capital project in scotland 's history - then it makes perfect sense for us to have the financial responsibility to match .
" what this issue clearly illustrates is the need for the scottish parliament to have borrowing powers , so that we have the ability to phase the funding of major capital projects sensibly and efficiently . "

westminster last week rejected the snp 's plan to borrow money from future budgets to fund the £ 2bn bridge , paying it back over 20 years .
mr murphy said it was important to make progress on the issue .
it comes as the scottish government produced a list of bodies which support its call for full borrowing powers .
the uk treasury rejected the request to borrow from future budgets as " not a credible option " .
mr murphy said he thought progress could be made and has invited both sides to meet on 27 january .
he said : " i 'm inviting the snp government and the treasury to talks despite the way in which the snp 's played politics with this .
the sums do n't add up .
they are trying to borrow money against budgets that do n't even yet exist over a period of two decades .
" but despite the fact the snp sums do n't add up , it is important that we do make progress which is why i 'm inviting them to these talks .
because it is important that we build this new forth crossing , we want the right crossing at the right price .
i think we can make progress . "
finance secretary john swinney said he was delighted about the meetings but was in no doubt that about the right way forward .
he said : " the sensible way to proceed is to undertake this bridge project under traditional government procurement and we 've got the money to pay for that in our capital budgets .
" what 's important is that we have a sensible and constructive discussion with the treasury about spreading the cost of the bridge over a number of years to ensure that we can support other capital projects at the same time .
i 'd be delighted to discuss that issue with the treasury because it reflects a sensible way forward . "
borrowing powers the stuc , the chartered institute of public finance and accountancy and former labour first minister henry mcleish have added their names to a list of public bodies who support the scottish government 's call for full borrowing powers .
a spokesman for first minister alex salmond said : " if we have responsibility for major issues such as funding a new forth bridge - the biggest capital project in scotland 's history - then it makes perfect sense for us to have the financial responsibility to match .
" what this issue clearly illustrates is the need for the scottish parliament to have borrowing powers , so that we have the ability to phase the funding of major capital projects sensibly and efficiently . "
he said scottish government should be able to make its own decisions on how to reflate the economy during the current downturn and said the northern ireland assembly 's had borrowing powers of up to £ 2.5bn the royal society of edinburgh , the society of local authority chief executives and senior managers , reform scotland , the scottish council foundation , liberal democrat leader tavish scott , the church of scotland and the scottish episcopal church are also among the groups said to be backing the government .
