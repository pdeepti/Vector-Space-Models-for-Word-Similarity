dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .
now he has told the czech daily lidovy noviny the treaty ca n't be stopped .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .
recently he demanded an exemption for the czech republic to prevent germans expelled after world war ii from using eu laws to get around czech laws and reclaim property .
klaus is opposed to the treaty on principle , telling lidovy noviny , " i do not consider the lisbon treaty to be a good thing for europe , for the freedom of europe , or for the czech republic . "
klaus denies he 's stalling for britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has led the fight against the lisbon treaty in the czech republic some observers have wondered if klaus ' most recent stipulation is simply a stalling tactic , meant to give british conservative leader david cameron the time to win upcoming general elections in the united kingdom and hold a promised nation-wide referendum on the treaty .
but klaus told the lidovy noviny that he did not intend to wait until after british elections .
" i can not and i will not wait for british elections , unless they hold them in the next few days or weeks , " he said .
currently , the czech constitutional court is looking into whether the treaty is in compliance with the country ’ s constitution .
a hearing is scheduled for october 27 and klaus is barred from signing the document until after the court ’ s decision. hf / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .
seeking unity prior to copenhagen meanwhile , in europe , swedish environment minister andreas carlgren was preparing for what 's being called a " super week in luxembourg , " where european union ministers will come together starting tuesday for talks designed to establish the eu 's position on every aspect of global warming ahead of copenhagen .
there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .
but time might be running out for the maldives in the indian ocean .
in 2007 , the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that a rise in sea levels of 18 to 59 cm -lrb- 7 to 24 inches -rrb- by 2100 would be enough to make the country virtually uninhabitable. sjt / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.10.2009 negotiations continue between members of germany 's next ruling coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no word on cabinet positions for either side christian democrats and free democrats are expected to agree on a coalition deal by the end of next week .
some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .

economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .
watching the watchmen called " zensursula , " or censorsula , by the awards ' organizers , ursula von der leyen won for her initiatives to block access to child pornography websites . this , according to the award 's justification , created " a system for advanced content control on the internet , which could evolve into orwellian proportions . "

interior minister schaeuble 's prize was one of recognition of lifetime achievement for his " obsessive ambition for turning the constitutional democracy into a preventatively authoritarian police-state , " according to foebud .
rewarding the many , as well as the few also honored with an award was the international association of athletics federations , which organized the world championships in berlin in august , for its invasively in-depth background checks on journalists in order to be permitted to cover the event .
other awards went to german firms lidl , kik textiles , hdi gerling , deutsche bahn , deutsche post and deutsche telekom , as well as the farming company claas gmbh , which was highlighted for placing a gps tracking device in its combine harvesters to ensure no deviations were made by the vehicle during harvesting .
upcoming big brother awards are in zurich , switzerland on 24 october and vienna , austria on 25 october. sjt / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .
seeking unity prior to copenhagen meanwhile , in europe , swedish environment minister andreas carlgren was preparing for what 's being called a " super week in luxembourg , " where european union ministers will come together starting tuesday for talks designed to establish the eu 's position on every aspect of global warming ahead of copenhagen .
there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .
but time might be running out for the maldives in the indian ocean .
in 2007 , the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that a rise in sea levels of 18 to 59 cm -lrb- 7 to 24 inches -rrb- by 2100 would be enough to make the country virtually uninhabitable. sjt / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .
now he has told the czech daily lidovy noviny the treaty ca n't be stopped .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .
recently he demanded an exemption for the czech republic to prevent germans expelled after world war ii from using eu laws to get around czech laws and reclaim property .

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .

it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .

refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .

my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .

dw correspondent gavin blackburn decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .

dw correspondent gavin blackburn decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .

" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .

back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .

refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

dw correspondent gavin blackburn decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .
watching the watchmen called " zensursula , " or censorsula , by the awards ' organizers , ursula von der leyen won for her initiatives to block access to child pornography websites . this , according to the award 's justification , created " a system for advanced content control on the internet , which could evolve into orwellian proportions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organizers warn of " orwellian proportions " as in the famous novel " 1984 " however , the issue seemed moot as , the day before the awards ceremony , new measures were announced by the christian democrats and free liberal parties , that child pornography sites would be deleted at the source , rather than try to limit internet access .
interior minister schaeuble 's prize was one of recognition of lifetime achievement for his " obsessive ambition for turning the constitutional democracy into a preventatively authoritarian police-state , " according to foebud .
rewarding the many , as well as the few also honored with an award was the international association of athletics federations , which organized the world championships in berlin in august , for its invasively in-depth background checks on journalists in order to be permitted to cover the event .
other awards went to german firms lidl , kik textiles , hdi gerling , deutsche bahn , deutsche post and deutsche telekom , as well as the farming company claas gmbh , which was highlighted for placing a gps tracking device in its combine harvesters to ensure no deviations were made by the vehicle during harvesting .

some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .
seeking unity prior to copenhagen meanwhile , in europe , swedish environment minister andreas carlgren was preparing for what 's being called a " super week in luxembourg , " where european union ministers will come together starting tuesday for talks designed to establish the eu 's position on every aspect of global warming ahead of copenhagen .
there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .
but time might be running out for the maldives in the indian ocean .
in 2007 , the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that a rise in sea levels of 18 to 59 cm -lrb- 7 to 24 inches -rrb- by 2100 would be enough to make the country virtually uninhabitable. sjt / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.10.2009 negotiations continue between members of germany 's next ruling coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no word on cabinet positions for either side christian democrats and free democrats are expected to agree on a coalition deal by the end of next week .
some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .
now he has told the czech daily lidovy noviny the treaty ca n't be stopped .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .
recently he demanded an exemption for the czech republic to prevent germans expelled after world war ii from using eu laws to get around czech laws and reclaim property .

but klaus told the lidovy noviny that he did not intend to wait until after british elections .
" i can not and i will not wait for british elections , unless they hold them in the next few days or weeks , " he said .
currently , the czech constitutional court is looking into whether the treaty is in compliance with the country ’ s constitution .

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .
now he has told the czech daily lidovy noviny the treaty ca n't be stopped .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .
recently he demanded an exemption for the czech republic to prevent germans expelled after world war ii from using eu laws to get around czech laws and reclaim property .
klaus is opposed to the treaty on principle , telling lidovy noviny , " i do not consider the lisbon treaty to be a good thing for europe , for the freedom of europe , or for the czech republic . "
klaus denies he 's stalling for britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has led the fight against the lisbon treaty in the czech republic some observers have wondered if klaus ' most recent stipulation is simply a stalling tactic , meant to give british conservative leader david cameron the time to win upcoming general elections in the united kingdom and hold a promised nation-wide referendum on the treaty .
but klaus told the lidovy noviny that he did not intend to wait until after british elections .
" i can not and i will not wait for british elections , unless they hold them in the next few days or weeks , " he said .
currently , the czech constitutional court is looking into whether the treaty is in compliance with the country ’ s constitution .
a hearing is scheduled for october 27 and klaus is barred from signing the document until after the court ’ s decision. hf / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .
watching the watchmen called " zensursula , " or censorsula , by the awards ' organizers , ursula von der leyen won for her initiatives to block access to child pornography websites . this , according to the award 's justification , created " a system for advanced content control on the internet , which could evolve into orwellian proportions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organizers warn of " orwellian proportions " as in the famous novel " 1984 " however , the issue seemed moot as , the day before the awards ceremony , new measures were announced by the christian democrats and free liberal parties , that child pornography sites would be deleted at the source , rather than try to limit internet access .
interior minister schaeuble 's prize was one of recognition of lifetime achievement for his " obsessive ambition for turning the constitutional democracy into a preventatively authoritarian police-state , " according to foebud .
rewarding the many , as well as the few also honored with an award was the international association of athletics federations , which organized the world championships in berlin in august , for its invasively in-depth background checks on journalists in order to be permitted to cover the event .
other awards went to german firms lidl , kik textiles , hdi gerling , deutsche bahn , deutsche post and deutsche telekom , as well as the farming company claas gmbh , which was highlighted for placing a gps tracking device in its combine harvesters to ensure no deviations were made by the vehicle during harvesting .

dw correspondent gavin blackburn decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .

my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .

president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 17.10.2009 politicians , corporations ' rewarded ' for infringing privacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : awards go to those who are considered to excel in the violation of privacy an annual award for the greatest abusers of data protection and privacy infringement is highlighting those , considered by some , to be german privacy 's public enemies .
this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .
watching the watchmen called " zensursula , " or censorsula , by the awards ' organizers , ursula von der leyen won for her initiatives to block access to child pornography websites . this , according to the award 's justification , created " a system for advanced content control on the internet , which could evolve into orwellian proportions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organizers warn of " orwellian proportions " as in the famous novel " 1984 " however , the issue seemed moot as , the day before the awards ceremony , new measures were announced by the christian democrats and free liberal parties , that child pornography sites would be deleted at the source , rather than try to limit internet access .
interior minister schaeuble 's prize was one of recognition of lifetime achievement for his " obsessive ambition for turning the constitutional democracy into a preventatively authoritarian police-state , " according to foebud .
rewarding the many , as well as the few also honored with an award was the international association of athletics federations , which organized the world championships in berlin in august , for its invasively in-depth background checks on journalists in order to be permitted to cover the event .
other awards went to german firms lidl , kik textiles , hdi gerling , deutsche bahn , deutsche post and deutsche telekom , as well as the farming company claas gmbh , which was highlighted for placing a gps tracking device in its combine harvesters to ensure no deviations were made by the vehicle during harvesting .
upcoming big brother awards are in zurich , switzerland on 24 october and vienna , austria on 25 october. sjt / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but do they really hit the mark ? -lrb- 16.10.2009 -rrb- german coalition under fire for backing online investigation in an effort to enhance national security , berlin has approved a new law allowing the federal criminal police to secretly investigate personal computers .
critics warn the legislation is a violation of the constitution .

some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .

there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .

there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .
but time might be running out for the maldives in the indian ocean .
in 2007 , the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that a rise in sea levels of 18 to 59 cm -lrb- 7 to 24 inches -rrb- by 2100 would be enough to make the country virtually uninhabitable. sjt / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw correspondent gavin blackburn decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .

some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .
watching the watchmen called " zensursula , " or censorsula , by the awards ' organizers , ursula von der leyen won for her initiatives to block access to child pornography websites . this , according to the award 's justification , created " a system for advanced content control on the internet , which could evolve into orwellian proportions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organizers warn of " orwellian proportions " as in the famous novel " 1984 " however , the issue seemed moot as , the day before the awards ceremony , new measures were announced by the christian democrats and free liberal parties , that child pornography sites would be deleted at the source , rather than try to limit internet access .
interior minister schaeuble 's prize was one of recognition of lifetime achievement for his " obsessive ambition for turning the constitutional democracy into a preventatively authoritarian police-state , " according to foebud .
rewarding the many , as well as the few also honored with an award was the international association of athletics federations , which organized the world championships in berlin in august , for its invasively in-depth background checks on journalists in order to be permitted to cover the event .
other awards went to german firms lidl , kik textiles , hdi gerling , deutsche bahn , deutsche post and deutsche telekom , as well as the farming company claas gmbh , which was highlighted for placing a gps tracking device in its combine harvesters to ensure no deviations were made by the vehicle during harvesting .
upcoming big brother awards are in zurich , switzerland on 24 october and vienna , austria on 25 october. sjt / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .
seeking unity prior to copenhagen meanwhile , in europe , swedish environment minister andreas carlgren was preparing for what 's being called a " super week in luxembourg , " where european union ministers will come together starting tuesday for talks designed to establish the eu 's position on every aspect of global warming ahead of copenhagen .
there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .
but time might be running out for the maldives in the indian ocean .
in 2007 , the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that a rise in sea levels of 18 to 59 cm -lrb- 7 to 24 inches -rrb- by 2100 would be enough to make the country virtually uninhabitable. sjt / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .
now he has told the czech daily lidovy noviny the treaty ca n't be stopped .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .
recently he demanded an exemption for the czech republic to prevent germans expelled after world war ii from using eu laws to get around czech laws and reclaim property .
klaus is opposed to the treaty on principle , telling lidovy noviny , " i do not consider the lisbon treaty to be a good thing for europe , for the freedom of europe , or for the czech republic . "
klaus denies he 's stalling for britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has led the fight against the lisbon treaty in the czech republic some observers have wondered if klaus ' most recent stipulation is simply a stalling tactic , meant to give british conservative leader david cameron the time to win upcoming general elections in the united kingdom and hold a promised nation-wide referendum on the treaty .
but klaus told the lidovy noviny that he did not intend to wait until after british elections .
" i can not and i will not wait for british elections , unless they hold them in the next few days or weeks , " he said .
currently , the czech constitutional court is looking into whether the treaty is in compliance with the country ’ s constitution .

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .
now he has told the czech daily lidovy noviny the treaty ca n't be stopped .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .
recently he demanded an exemption for the czech republic to prevent germans expelled after world war ii from using eu laws to get around czech laws and reclaim property .
klaus is opposed to the treaty on principle , telling lidovy noviny , " i do not consider the lisbon treaty to be a good thing for europe , for the freedom of europe , or for the czech republic . "

but klaus told the lidovy noviny that he did not intend to wait until after british elections .
" i can not and i will not wait for british elections , unless they hold them in the next few days or weeks , " he said .

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .
seeking unity prior to copenhagen meanwhile , in europe , swedish environment minister andreas carlgren was preparing for what 's being called a " super week in luxembourg , " where european union ministers will come together starting tuesday for talks designed to establish the eu 's position on every aspect of global warming ahead of copenhagen .
there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .
but time might be running out for the maldives in the indian ocean .
in 2007 , the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that a rise in sea levels of 18 to 59 cm -lrb- 7 to 24 inches -rrb- by 2100 would be enough to make the country virtually uninhabitable. sjt / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.10.2009 negotiations continue between members of germany 's next ruling coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no word on cabinet positions for either side christian democrats and free democrats are expected to agree on a coalition deal by the end of next week .
some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .

cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .

the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .
now he has told the czech daily lidovy noviny the treaty ca n't be stopped .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .
recently he demanded an exemption for the czech republic to prevent germans expelled after world war ii from using eu laws to get around czech laws and reclaim property .
klaus is opposed to the treaty on principle , telling lidovy noviny , " i do not consider the lisbon treaty to be a good thing for europe , for the freedom of europe , or for the czech republic . "
klaus denies he 's stalling for britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has led the fight against the lisbon treaty in the czech republic some observers have wondered if klaus ' most recent stipulation is simply a stalling tactic , meant to give british conservative leader david cameron the time to win upcoming general elections in the united kingdom and hold a promised nation-wide referendum on the treaty .
but klaus told the lidovy noviny that he did not intend to wait until after british elections .
" i can not and i will not wait for british elections , unless they hold them in the next few days or weeks , " he said .
currently , the czech constitutional court is looking into whether the treaty is in compliance with the country ’ s constitution .
a hearing is scheduled for october 27 and klaus is barred from signing the document until after the court ’ s decision. hf / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .

other awards went to german firms lidl , kik textiles , hdi gerling , deutsche bahn , deutsche post and deutsche telekom , as well as the farming company claas gmbh , which was highlighted for placing a gps tracking device in its combine harvesters to ensure no deviations were made by the vehicle during harvesting .

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .
watching the watchmen called " zensursula , " or censorsula , by the awards ' organizers , ursula von der leyen won for her initiatives to block access to child pornography websites . this , according to the award 's justification , created " a system for advanced content control on the internet , which could evolve into orwellian proportions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organizers warn of " orwellian proportions " as in the famous novel " 1984 " however , the issue seemed moot as , the day before the awards ceremony , new measures were announced by the christian democrats and free liberal parties , that child pornography sites would be deleted at the source , rather than try to limit internet access .
interior minister schaeuble 's prize was one of recognition of lifetime achievement for his " obsessive ambition for turning the constitutional democracy into a preventatively authoritarian police-state , " according to foebud .
rewarding the many , as well as the few also honored with an award was the international association of athletics federations , which organized the world championships in berlin in august , for its invasively in-depth background checks on journalists in order to be permitted to cover the event .
other awards went to german firms lidl , kik textiles , hdi gerling , deutsche bahn , deutsche post and deutsche telekom , as well as the farming company claas gmbh , which was highlighted for placing a gps tracking device in its combine harvesters to ensure no deviations were made by the vehicle during harvesting .
upcoming big brother awards are in zurich , switzerland on 24 october and vienna , austria on 25 october. sjt / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .

there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .
now he has told the czech daily lidovy noviny the treaty ca n't be stopped .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .
recently he demanded an exemption for the czech republic to prevent germans expelled after world war ii from using eu laws to get around czech laws and reclaim property .
klaus is opposed to the treaty on principle , telling lidovy noviny , " i do not consider the lisbon treaty to be a good thing for europe , for the freedom of europe , or for the czech republic . "
klaus denies he 's stalling for britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has led the fight against the lisbon treaty in the czech republic some observers have wondered if klaus ' most recent stipulation is simply a stalling tactic , meant to give british conservative leader david cameron the time to win upcoming general elections in the united kingdom and hold a promised nation-wide referendum on the treaty .
but klaus told the lidovy noviny that he did not intend to wait until after british elections .
" i can not and i will not wait for british elections , unless they hold them in the next few days or weeks , " he said .
currently , the czech constitutional court is looking into whether the treaty is in compliance with the country ’ s constitution .
a hearing is scheduled for october 27 and klaus is barred from signing the document until after the court ’ s decision. hf / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .
watching the watchmen called " zensursula , " or censorsula , by the awards ' organizers , ursula von der leyen won for her initiatives to block access to child pornography websites . this , according to the award 's justification , created " a system for advanced content control on the internet , which could evolve into orwellian proportions . "

interior minister schaeuble 's prize was one of recognition of lifetime achievement for his " obsessive ambition for turning the constitutional democracy into a preventatively authoritarian police-state , " according to foebud .
rewarding the many , as well as the few also honored with an award was the international association of athletics federations , which organized the world championships in berlin in august , for its invasively in-depth background checks on journalists in order to be permitted to cover the event .
other awards went to german firms lidl , kik textiles , hdi gerling , deutsche bahn , deutsche post and deutsche telekom , as well as the farming company claas gmbh , which was highlighted for placing a gps tracking device in its combine harvesters to ensure no deviations were made by the vehicle during harvesting .

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .

" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .

but klaus told the lidovy noviny that he did not intend to wait until after british elections .
" i can not and i will not wait for british elections , unless they hold them in the next few days or weeks , " he said .
currently , the czech constitutional court is looking into whether the treaty is in compliance with the country ’ s constitution .
a hearing is scheduled for october 27 and klaus is barred from signing the document until after the court ’ s decision. hf / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2009 underwater politics : raising climate change awareness in the maldives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of the maldives hopes this scene is n't foreshadowing in a move guaranteed to prevent filibustering , the government of the maldives took their weekly cabinet meeting below the waves .
the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .
seeking unity prior to copenhagen meanwhile , in europe , swedish environment minister andreas carlgren was preparing for what 's being called a " super week in luxembourg , " where european union ministers will come together starting tuesday for talks designed to establish the eu 's position on every aspect of global warming ahead of copenhagen .
there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .
seeking unity prior to copenhagen meanwhile , in europe , swedish environment minister andreas carlgren was preparing for what 's being called a " super week in luxembourg , " where european union ministers will come together starting tuesday for talks designed to establish the eu 's position on every aspect of global warming ahead of copenhagen .
there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .

cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .

economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .
seeking unity prior to copenhagen meanwhile , in europe , swedish environment minister andreas carlgren was preparing for what 's being called a " super week in luxembourg , " where european union ministers will come together starting tuesday for talks designed to establish the eu 's position on every aspect of global warming ahead of copenhagen .
there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .
but time might be running out for the maldives in the indian ocean .
in 2007 , the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that a rise in sea levels of 18 to 59 cm -lrb- 7 to 24 inches -rrb- by 2100 would be enough to make the country virtually uninhabitable. sjt / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw correspondent gavin blackburn decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .

interior minister schaeuble 's prize was one of recognition of lifetime achievement for his " obsessive ambition for turning the constitutional democracy into a preventatively authoritarian police-state , " according to foebud .

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .

some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .
now he has told the czech daily lidovy noviny the treaty ca n't be stopped .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .
recently he demanded an exemption for the czech republic to prevent germans expelled after world war ii from using eu laws to get around czech laws and reclaim property .
klaus is opposed to the treaty on principle , telling lidovy noviny , " i do not consider the lisbon treaty to be a good thing for europe , for the freedom of europe , or for the czech republic . "
klaus denies he 's stalling for britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has led the fight against the lisbon treaty in the czech republic some observers have wondered if klaus ' most recent stipulation is simply a stalling tactic , meant to give british conservative leader david cameron the time to win upcoming general elections in the united kingdom and hold a promised nation-wide referendum on the treaty .
but klaus told the lidovy noviny that he did not intend to wait until after british elections .
" i can not and i will not wait for british elections , unless they hold them in the next few days or weeks , " he said .
currently , the czech constitutional court is looking into whether the treaty is in compliance with the country ’ s constitution .
a hearing is scheduled for october 27 and klaus is barred from signing the document until after the court ’ s decision. hf / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .

cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .

the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .

economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .

some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw correspondent gavin blackburn decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .

it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .

but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .
watching the watchmen called " zensursula , " or censorsula , by the awards ' organizers , ursula von der leyen won for her initiatives to block access to child pornography websites . this , according to the award 's justification , created " a system for advanced content control on the internet , which could evolve into orwellian proportions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organizers warn of " orwellian proportions " as in the famous novel " 1984 " however , the issue seemed moot as , the day before the awards ceremony , new measures were announced by the christian democrats and free liberal parties , that child pornography sites would be deleted at the source , rather than try to limit internet access .
interior minister schaeuble 's prize was one of recognition of lifetime achievement for his " obsessive ambition for turning the constitutional democracy into a preventatively authoritarian police-state , " according to foebud .
rewarding the many , as well as the few also honored with an award was the international association of athletics federations , which organized the world championships in berlin in august , for its invasively in-depth background checks on journalists in order to be permitted to cover the event .
other awards went to german firms lidl , kik textiles , hdi gerling , deutsche bahn , deutsche post and deutsche telekom , as well as the farming company claas gmbh , which was highlighted for placing a gps tracking device in its combine harvesters to ensure no deviations were made by the vehicle during harvesting .
upcoming big brother awards are in zurich , switzerland on 24 october and vienna , austria on 25 october. sjt / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

this is one award that no one wants to receive . the big brother awards 2009 wrapped up in germany on friday , handing out recognition to politicians and corporations with records of data and privacy infingement .
the big " winners " of friday 's big brother awards were germany 's family minister ursula von der leyen and interior minister wolfgang schaeuble along with a slew of companies .
these so-called " oscars for data leeches " have been awarded each year since 2000 by the foebud association which was formed in 1987 for the promotion of mobile and immobile public data traffic .
watching the watchmen called " zensursula , " or censorsula , by the awards ' organizers , ursula von der leyen won for her initiatives to block access to child pornography websites . this , according to the award 's justification , created " a system for advanced content control on the internet , which could evolve into orwellian proportions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organizers warn of " orwellian proportions " as in the famous novel " 1984 " however , the issue seemed moot as , the day before the awards ceremony , new measures were announced by the christian democrats and free liberal parties , that child pornography sites would be deleted at the source , rather than try to limit internet access .
interior minister schaeuble 's prize was one of recognition of lifetime achievement for his " obsessive ambition for turning the constitutional democracy into a preventatively authoritarian police-state , " according to foebud .
rewarding the many , as well as the few also honored with an award was the international association of athletics federations , which organized the world championships in berlin in august , for its invasively in-depth background checks on journalists in order to be permitted to cover the event .
other awards went to german firms lidl , kik textiles , hdi gerling , deutsche bahn , deutsche post and deutsche telekom , as well as the farming company claas gmbh , which was highlighted for placing a gps tracking device in its combine harvesters to ensure no deviations were made by the vehicle during harvesting .
upcoming big brother awards are in zurich , switzerland on 24 october and vienna , austria on 25 october. sjt / dpa / epd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.10.2009 negotiations continue between members of germany 's next ruling coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still no word on cabinet positions for either side christian democrats and free democrats are expected to agree on a coalition deal by the end of next week .
some items have been finalized , but a lot is still on the table . german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- have announced that a coalition would most likely be finalized by next week .
cdu and fdp representatives admitted that they still have not been able to agree on tax cuts or how to finance them , but other issues , such as financial regulation and how to deal with turkey 's bid for the european union , have been settled .
the heads of the three parties involved , angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- , guido westerwelle -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- a sister party to the cdu , plan on continuing negotiations with other party leaders into sunday night .
the prospective coalition partners are keen to lower taxes , though there is a lot of debate over how large they should be .
the cdu has proposed 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- , but it is still unclear how they will be able to finance them as europe 's largest economy struggles to pull itself out of it 's deepest economic slump in 60 years .
the biggest item on the agenda - the division of the various government cabinet posts - will be the last thing to be decided , and final names are n't expected until the end of next week .
agreement on nuclear power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two sides have agreed to continue using nuclear power until renewable energy technology is more readily available the two sides have agreed on extending the running time of the country 's nuclear power plants along with the expansion of environmentally friendly energy sources .
economics and technology minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg announced on saturday that nuclear power would merely be a carryover technology .
" we have made regenerative energy one of our main goals , " he said , adding that both parties see them as an integral part of the future .
while the energy plan of the new coalition has been hammered out , there is no exact date for how long the nuclear plants will continue to run .
a working group drawing up policy on economic matters said the parties had agreed to cut the costs of bureaucracy which would especially help small and medium-sized businesses .
the parties are also wrangling over germany 's health fund which needs a 7.5 billion euro cash injection .
the new coalition will keep the fund , which the fdp had wanted to abolish , but make big changes to it , said leading cdu member ursula von der leyen. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : ranty islam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he says it 's too far gone to block , even if he wants to . the czech republic is the last of the 27 european union countries to not ratify the eu 's lisbon treaty and its euroskeptic president vaclav klaus has done everything he can to prevent the treaty from going through .
now he has told the czech daily lidovy noviny the treaty ca n't be stopped .
" the train carrying the treaty is going so fast and it 's so far that it ca n't be stopped or returned , " he told the paper .
" no matter how much some of us would want that . "
klaus has dragged his feet on signing the document , which is meant to streamline eu operations and give the bloc a long-term president , even though the czech parliament has already voted in favor of it .
recently he demanded an exemption for the czech republic to prevent germans expelled after world war ii from using eu laws to get around czech laws and reclaim property .
klaus is opposed to the treaty on principle , telling lidovy noviny , " i do not consider the lisbon treaty to be a good thing for europe , for the freedom of europe , or for the czech republic . "
klaus denies he 's stalling for britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president klaus has led the fight against the lisbon treaty in the czech republic some observers have wondered if klaus ' most recent stipulation is simply a stalling tactic , meant to give british conservative leader david cameron the time to win upcoming general elections in the united kingdom and hold a promised nation-wide referendum on the treaty .
but klaus told the lidovy noviny that he did not intend to wait until after british elections .
" i can not and i will not wait for british elections , unless they hold them in the next few days or weeks , " he said .
currently , the czech constitutional court is looking into whether the treaty is in compliance with the country ’ s constitution .
a hearing is scheduled for october 27 and klaus is barred from signing the document until after the court ’ s decision. hf / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting highlights the maldives ' precarious situation due to rising sea levels . the maldives ' government held an underwater cabinet meeting on saturday to draw attention to climate change while european leaders prepared for a week of climate talks ahead of the copenhagen summit in december .
president mohamed nasheed and 13 of his ministers and other senior government officials sat , in scuba gear , around a table six meters -lrb- 20 feet -rrb- below the water 's surface and signed a resolution calling for global action to cut carbon emissions .
the ministers and president communicated by hand signal and signed the resolution on a white board with water proof markers in an act designed to focus global attention on rising sea levels caused by climate change . more than 80 percent of the maldives ' archipelago , a luxury tourism destination , is less than one meter -lrb- 3.3 feet -rrb- above sea level , and at risk of being submerged .
" we should come out of copenhagen with a deal that will ensure that everyone will survive , " nasheed said as he floated in the water after the cabinet meeting .
seeking unity prior to copenhagen meanwhile , in europe , swedish environment minister andreas carlgren was preparing for what 's being called a " super week in luxembourg , " where european union ministers will come together starting tuesday for talks designed to establish the eu 's position on every aspect of global warming ahead of copenhagen .
there is a lot of ground to cover , however , and some insiders think there are still too many disagreements between the 27 member states of the eu .
according to internal documents , sweden wants to have the eu fast-track funds to developing nations in order to fight climate change , but some argue that it is too early to pledge funds internationally with the financial crisis still playing havoc in europe .
but time might be running out for the maldives in the indian ocean .
in 2007 , the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that a rise in sea levels of 18 to 59 cm -lrb- 7 to 24 inches -rrb- by 2100 would be enough to make the country virtually uninhabitable. sjt / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw correspondent neale lytollis decided to indulge in a little " ostalgie " - nostalgia for the old east germany - and tried traveling the " trabi " way . my adventure through east berlin 's past starts on a street corner in the city center , where i 'm about to jump into my chauffeur-driven transport .
sadly , it 's not a limousine - it 's a trabant or " trabi , " as they were fondly nicknamed .
it might be a little cramped and not especially aerodynamic , but it 's one of the most definitive symbols of the gdr and perfect for zipping around the city .
" it 's made up of a two-stroke engine , it takes a mixture of gas and oil , sounds more or less like a lawnmower and it 's with a gear shift which is beside the steering wheel , " my driver , simon matern , explains .
he works for trabi safari , a company that organizes city tours in east germany 's most famous car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw correspondent neale lytollis " these trabants are really rare in the city center nowadays , " matern says .
" people are really excited when they see a trabant and they take out their cameras and take pictures of you , so you feel like a vip after you 've had a tour in a trabant . "
although a trabant is not the first car which would immediately spring to mind if i wanted to experience a bit of vip treatment , it 's nevertheless an enjoyable ride .
motoring through the busy berlin traffic , we 're on our way to the velodrom to visit ostpro , a trade fair selling products by brands from the former east germany .
keeping gdr cuisine alive the place is packed not only with people but also with products i 've never heard of , such as vita cola , imnu malt coffee and fetzer chocolate bars .
there 's also cakes , cosmetics , books , t-shirts , socks , bras , and even one enterprising salesman praising the advantages of buying east german cookware .
the first such fair took place in 1991 , shortly after the fall of the wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several gdr brands have experienced resurgence in recent years " the thing is , all these products disappeared overnight , " says ramona oteiza from scot messen und marketing , the company which organized the ostpro fair .
" you ca n't really imagine what it was like unless you lived through it .
of course , people tried the newly-available products , but found themselves going back to the tried and trusted products they 'd always known .
since we are event organizers , we thought we 'd have a go at organizing something like this – and bingo !
it worked . "
back in our trusty trabant , we head off to the osseria , a restaurant in berlin 's weissensee district which uses east german products and traditional ingredients to create an authentic gdr-era culinary experience .
the osseria is an ostalgie paradise .
the walls are covered with old advertisements for clothes , electrical goods and cigarettes , and there 's some framed east german money .
perhaps the most spectacular feature is a gallery of record sleeves from east german music stars which takes up all of one wall .
there are also gdr typewriters , cassette players and radios dotted around the place .
even the menu has come from a former east german government office .
a red leather binder embossed in gold with the logo of the socialist sed party , it lists such delights as hungarian stew , hawaii toast -lrb- slice of toast topped with ham , cheese and pineapple -rrb- , and my choice for the evening , boulletten , which are chunky burgers served with a fried egg and roast potatoes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ostel is completely decorated in gdr style after dinner , i 'm feeling rather tired so i retreat to the ostel , a city center hostel decorated in authentic gdr style .
my room is rather basic .
there 's a couple of rather uncomfortable armchairs , a coffee table , and a 70 's-style lamp .
the double bed is covered with a flowery quilt and the wall above it is the only one in the room to feature any wallpaper , in this case , a green , white , and yellow floral print .
it provides a rather gaudy backdrop for a framed picture of east germany 's most famous leader , erich honecker .
past was surprisingly colorful daniel helbig , co-founder and manager of ostel , admits that there is one key difference between what his guests expect , and what they actually experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rooms come complete with a picture of erich honecker " they really do n't think that the gdr was so colorful , " he says .
" if you think of the gdr , you tend to think it was all grey and utilitarian .
but what we discovered when we put the place together was that there was a lot of color and diversity in the production of things .
for example , we have around 50 different models of gdr radios here , as well as 180 different kinds of lamps . "
refreshed from my night 's sleep in the ostel , i venture out to berlin 's free university in the western part of the city to delve deeper into the ostalgie phenomenon .
jochen staadt , a researcher who specializes in east german culture , says ostalgie is not about a real longing to reinstate the gdr . "
when you ask people if they want to have the gdr back , you wo n't find many who say they want it back as it was , " staadt says .
" what they miss is the sense of being together , a feeling of being more connected with each other .
in the gdr , people had to rely on each other and i think that is what they really miss . "
my own nostalgia trip through the gdr has come to an end , and i 'm surprised to see that so much of east german culture is still alive and kicking in berlin .
it 's time to head home , but my trabant is steadfastly refusing to start .
clearly , it 's had enough of this journey through history , and is ready for a rest .

john mcfall mp said that some companies had adequate procedures in place for bereavements , but others did not treat customers fairly .
he is calling for a new code of practice to ensure financial services companies act as they should .
however , the british bankers ' association said training was in place .
" the main issues are treating people fairly at the most stressful time of their lives .
we have had evidence that people have had to jump through unnecessary hurdles as a result of their business with banks and financial institutions , " said mr mcfall .
" i am writing to the financial services authority so that they can remind these institutions that treating customers fairly is a primary responsibility .
" they can develop a code of conduct so that it makes things easier for people at the most stressful time of their lives , rather than harder . "
" my big dream is that this does not happen to anybody else " ingrid facius ingrid facius lost her husband guy to cancer a year ago when she was four months pregnant with their daughter astrid .
at the time of his death guy , who left a valid will , had around £ 20,000 invested in an isa with financial group equiniti .
when she tried to access the money mrs facius said she was met with various obstacles .
" it is quite an intense time with a new baby .
the last thing i needed to be doing during my lunch hour nap time was to be ringing the company , trying to elicit some sort of response , and feeling very frustrated that i was not actually getting anywhere , " she said .
after nearly a year of writing letters her situation is now in the process of being resolved .
equiniti , the company dealing with the isa , has now apologised unreservedly for the delay and stress she experienced in settling the estate of her deceased husband .
it blamed a combination of human error and a processing fault and said steps were being put into place to ensure that this situation did not arise again . "
we would never expect people to walk into a bank , wave a piece of paper and say ' oh my husband is dead , can i have all his money ' " way foundation but the apology has come too late for mrs facius who wants the system to change .
" my big dream is that this does not happen to anybody else .
nobody deserves to go through this process , they need to grieve and they need the time to do that , " she said .
one bereavement support group , the way foundation , said it believed there could be many cases where financial institutions unnecessarily delayed payment to bereaved relatives .
the foundation 's chairman , caroline doughty , said the problems were avoidable .
legal formalities " we would never expect people to walk into a bank , wave a piece of paper and say ' oh my husband is dead , can i have all his money ' , " she said .
" but i think what needs to happen is more training across the board so that people working for any type of institution know how to have this difficult conversation with a client who has rung up . "
the british bankers ' association said there could be delays caused by completing legal formalities , particularly if an account was not held in joint names , but it also stressed that bank staff training did include guidance on helping customers who had recently been bereaved .

the diplomat , ri gun , is the deputy negotiator in stalled talks on north korea 's nuclear programme .
there have been recent moves to restart the talks .
one report said mr ri would attend a forum in california , while another said he was going to a meeting in new york .
he is also expected to discuss the nuclear issue in an informal meeting with a senior us counterpart .
" the state department has decided to authorise the issuance of visas for ambassador ri gun and his delegation to attend conferences in the united states in late october , " said state department spokesman ian kelly in a statement .
kim myong gil , a minister at north korea 's un mission , told the associated press news agency that mr ri would attend a private security forum in california .
ap cited a senior us source as saying mr ri was expected to discuss nuclear matters with a senior us diplomat during his visit .
reuters news agency cited an unnamed source as saying mr ri would likely meet us diplomat sung kim , though the source said he had been granted a visa to attend a meeting of north korean experts and scholars in new york .
earlier this month north korea said it was willing to return to multi-party negotiations on its nuclear programme , but it has said it wants direct negotiations with the us first .
the us has said it is willing to engage directly with north korea , but only as part of a return to six-party forum that pyongyang pulled out of in april .
the six-party talks involve the two koreas , china , the us , russia and japan .
tensions have risen in recent months after north korea launched a series of missiles and conducted an underground nuclear test - drawing un sanctions in response .
the us wants north korea to recommit to abandoning its nuclear programmes .
