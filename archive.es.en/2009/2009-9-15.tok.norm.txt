the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2009 desertification should not take a back seat to climate change debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worldwide desertification continues at a rapid pace the importance of fighting desertification is in danger of being overlooked by the attention given to climate change negotiations scheduled for the end of the year , science and technology expert steffen bauer writes . if we take a look beyond the current din of the campaigning here in germany , the term " copenhagen " seems to be everywhere .
the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2009 desertification should not take a back seat to climate change debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worldwide desertification continues at a rapid pace the importance of fighting desertification is in danger of being overlooked by the attention given to climate change negotiations scheduled for the end of the year , science and technology expert steffen bauer writes . if we take a look beyond the current din of the campaigning here in germany , the term " copenhagen " seems to be everywhere .
the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 15.09.2009 asia one year after lehman bros collapse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts think china could lead the world out of the financial crisis it was on 15th september last year that lehman brothers , the 158-year-old us investment bank , filed for bankruptcy .
the aftershocks of the collapse were felt worldwide .
although the economic crisis which followed is far from over , asia ’ s economies are showing signs of fast recovery , with china taking the lead . the economic crisis that followed the collapse of lehman brothers has been termed one of the worst since the great depression of the 1930s .
but while the united states continues to post poor consumer spending figures and depressing jobs data , the asian economies have already started looking up .
kyohei morita , the chief economist at barclays capital in tokyo , explained that “ the reason why asia could be the source of recovery for the global economy is because they were basically the beneficiaries of the global economic policies taken by the major economies especially .
the most notable example is the stimulus of the purchases of cars or autos or electrical appliances because asia can be regarded as the factory of these goods . ”
quick response to crisis ashok charan , a professor at national university of singapore , added that the asian governments , especially beijing , are recovering because they reacted very promptly .
especially , china which “ was very quick to respond to the crisis with a very large and substantial stimulus package by the government .
they were the first to show signs of bottoming out .
the developing world - china and india - are doing a bit better . ”
charan also thinks that increased domestic spending in the region has helped the asian economies recover faster than their western counterparts : “ the biggest potential for the government in particular was through triggering the domestic consumption because the chinese had amassed a huge sum in terms of savings .
the total savings in private and corporate in public china was to the tune of about 4.3 trillion us dollars which , compared to any other large economy , was really huge . traditionally , chinese have had the propensity to save . ”
emerging middle classes in china and india recently , the world bank lauded china for its measures that prevented the crisis from getting worse .
“ china as a whole continues to grow at 8 percent and india is expected to grow at 5.5 percent , ” charan explained .
“ over the years , in any case for the past 10 to 15 years , and this will go on for the future 10 to 20 years , both china and india have witnessed the emergence of the middle and upper middle class .
we asians are after all about 60 percent of the world ’ s population in terms of size and diversity and we are rapidly urbanising , ” he added .
kyohei morita of barclays capital in tokyo agreed : “ we still have at least 15 years of population growth without aging .
i would say that the savings ratio will not fall - at least over the coming 15 years . ”
“ it may take a few years before the us becomes as large a market as it was , ” warned charan .
“ so some realignment may take place and may go beyond asia , brazil and russia as well .
asia is not just china and india - there ’ s indonesia , which is clearly doing pretty very well at this moment and there ’ s vietnam , which is growing faster . ”
although the asian economies have shown signs of a speedy recovery from the crisis , experts warn that the consequences of the financial crisis will be long-lasting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 15.09.2009 asia one year after lehman bros collapse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts think china could lead the world out of the financial crisis it was on 15th september last year that lehman brothers , the 158-year-old us investment bank , filed for bankruptcy .
the aftershocks of the collapse were felt worldwide .
although the economic crisis which followed is far from over , asia ’ s economies are showing signs of fast recovery , with china taking the lead . the economic crisis that followed the collapse of lehman brothers has been termed one of the worst since the great depression of the 1930s .
but while the united states continues to post poor consumer spending figures and depressing jobs data , the asian economies have already started looking up .
kyohei morita , the chief economist at barclays capital in tokyo , explained that “ the reason why asia could be the source of recovery for the global economy is because they were basically the beneficiaries of the global economic policies taken by the major economies especially .
the most notable example is the stimulus of the purchases of cars or autos or electrical appliances because asia can be regarded as the factory of these goods . ”
quick response to crisis ashok charan , a professor at national university of singapore , added that the asian governments , especially beijing , are recovering because they reacted very promptly .
especially , china which “ was very quick to respond to the crisis with a very large and substantial stimulus package by the government .
they were the first to show signs of bottoming out .
the developing world - china and india - are doing a bit better . ”
charan also thinks that increased domestic spending in the region has helped the asian economies recover faster than their western counterparts : “ the biggest potential for the government in particular was through triggering the domestic consumption because the chinese had amassed a huge sum in terms of savings .
the total savings in private and corporate in public china was to the tune of about 4.3 trillion us dollars which , compared to any other large economy , was really huge . traditionally , chinese have had the propensity to save . ”
emerging middle classes in china and india recently , the world bank lauded china for its measures that prevented the crisis from getting worse .
“ china as a whole continues to grow at 8 percent and india is expected to grow at 5.5 percent , ” charan explained .
“ over the years , in any case for the past 10 to 15 years , and this will go on for the future 10 to 20 years , both china and india have witnessed the emergence of the middle and upper middle class .
we asians are after all about 60 percent of the world ’ s population in terms of size and diversity and we are rapidly urbanising , ” he added .
kyohei morita of barclays capital in tokyo agreed : “ we still have at least 15 years of population growth without aging .
i would say that the savings ratio will not fall - at least over the coming 15 years . ”
“ it may take a few years before the us becomes as large a market as it was , ” warned charan .
“ so some realignment may take place and may go beyond asia , brazil and russia as well .
asia is not just china and india - there ’ s indonesia , which is clearly doing pretty very well at this moment and there ’ s vietnam , which is growing faster . ”
although the asian economies have shown signs of a speedy recovery from the crisis , experts warn that the consequences of the financial crisis will be long-lasting .

“ so some realignment may take place and may go beyond asia , brazil and russia as well .
asia is not just china and india - there ’ s indonesia , which is clearly doing pretty very well at this moment and there ’ s vietnam , which is growing faster . ”
although the asian economies have shown signs of a speedy recovery from the crisis , experts warn that the consequences of the financial crisis will be long-lasting .

27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .

the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern munich roaring into champions league , wolfsburg and stuttgart limping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger and bayern are beginning to click as the champions league kicks off , last year 's runners-up from bavaria are surging .
meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .
the location and size of the ship described by fonti corresponded to saturday 's find .
he had said that the vessel , the cunsky , was loaded with radioactive waste at the time .
authorities said they would carry out tests on the barrels to determine whether their contents were radioactive. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the mission concluded that actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly in some respects crimes against humanity , were committed by the israel defense force , " said u.n. investigator richard goldstone to reporters .
he called on the un to insist that both israel and the palestinians launch investigations to get to the bottom of the charges .

it had refused to cooperate with the investigation , saying that the un human rights council was biased against the jewish state .

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision has angered bosnian muslim groups . plavsic , known as the " iron lady " , has served two-thirds of her sentence and will be eligible for parole in october under laws in sweden , where she is being detained .
in 2003 , she was convicted of the persecution of croats and bosnian muslims in the bosnian war , which raged from 1992 to 1995 .
plavsic had pleaded guilty to " inviting paramilitaries from serbia to assist bosnian serb forces in effecting ethnic separation by force " on political , racial and religious grounds .
the court had dropped charges of genocide , extermination and murder in return for her guilty plea .
the 79-year-old is the highest ranking official from the former yugoslavia to have acknowledged ordering atrocities perpetrated in the 1990 wars that sprang from the breakup of the yugoslav federation .
prior to the charges being dropped against her , plavsic had been one of three bosnian serb leaders , including radovan karadzic , due to face trial in october on multiple counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , such as those committed in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-herzegovina in july 1995 .
outrage over release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims gather every year to mourn srebrenica an estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys were massacred in srebrenica by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units .
muslim victims of the bosnian war were outraged tuesday by the decision taken by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to release plavsic .
" how can we explain this to children whose parents had been killed -lrb- in serb-run -rrb- camps -rrb- - children who remember their parents only from photos ? news agency afp quoted murat tahirovic , the head of an association of muslim and croat war camp prisoners , as asking .
munira subasic , the head of an association of survivors of the 1995 srebrenica massacre , said the only explanation for plavsic 's release was that " the world supports crime and criminals . "
" how is it possible that plavsic has the right to freedom and i do not have the right to find and bury the bones of my son 14 years after he was brutally killed ? " she asked. dfm / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .
however , italian side ac milan are in close pursuit after beating olympic marseille 2:1 in france .
in group d english side chelsea went to the top of the table after beating portuguese side fc porto 1:0 at stamford bridge .

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .

the decision has angered bosnian muslim groups . plavsic , known as the " iron lady " , has served two-thirds of her sentence and will be eligible for parole in october under laws in sweden , where she is being detained .
in 2003 , she was convicted of the persecution of croats and bosnian muslims in the bosnian war , which raged from 1992 to 1995 .
plavsic had pleaded guilty to " inviting paramilitaries from serbia to assist bosnian serb forces in effecting ethnic separation by force " on political , racial and religious grounds .
the court had dropped charges of genocide , extermination and murder in return for her guilty plea .
the 79-year-old is the highest ranking official from the former yugoslavia to have acknowledged ordering atrocities perpetrated in the 1990 wars that sprang from the breakup of the yugoslav federation .
prior to the charges being dropped against her , plavsic had been one of three bosnian serb leaders , including radovan karadzic , due to face trial in october on multiple counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , such as those committed in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-herzegovina in july 1995 .
outrage over release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims gather every year to mourn srebrenica an estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys were massacred in srebrenica by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units .
muslim victims of the bosnian war were outraged tuesday by the decision taken by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to release plavsic .
" how can we explain this to children whose parents had been killed -lrb- in serb-run -rrb- camps -rrb- - children who remember their parents only from photos ? news agency afp quoted murat tahirovic , the head of an association of muslim and croat war camp prisoners , as asking .
munira subasic , the head of an association of survivors of the 1995 srebrenica massacre , said the only explanation for plavsic 's release was that " the world supports crime and criminals . "

the decision has angered bosnian muslim groups . plavsic , known as the " iron lady " , has served two-thirds of her sentence and will be eligible for parole in october under laws in sweden , where she is being detained .
in 2003 , she was convicted of the persecution of croats and bosnian muslims in the bosnian war , which raged from 1992 to 1995 .
plavsic had pleaded guilty to " inviting paramilitaries from serbia to assist bosnian serb forces in effecting ethnic separation by force " on political , racial and religious grounds .
the court had dropped charges of genocide , extermination and murder in return for her guilty plea .
the 79-year-old is the highest ranking official from the former yugoslavia to have acknowledged ordering atrocities perpetrated in the 1990 wars that sprang from the breakup of the yugoslav federation .
prior to the charges being dropped against her , plavsic had been one of three bosnian serb leaders , including radovan karadzic , due to face trial in october on multiple counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , such as those committed in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-herzegovina in july 1995 .
outrage over release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims gather every year to mourn srebrenica an estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys were massacred in srebrenica by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units .
muslim victims of the bosnian war were outraged tuesday by the decision taken by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to release plavsic .
" how can we explain this to children whose parents had been killed -lrb- in serb-run -rrb- camps -rrb- - children who remember their parents only from photos ? news agency afp quoted murat tahirovic , the head of an association of muslim and croat war camp prisoners , as asking .
munira subasic , the head of an association of survivors of the 1995 srebrenica massacre , said the only explanation for plavsic 's release was that " the world supports crime and criminals . "
" how is it possible that plavsic has the right to freedom and i do not have the right to find and bury the bones of my son 14 years after he was brutally killed ?

but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .

if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 15.09.2009 social change transforms the classical concert in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classical concerts do n't always have to fit the same pattern with its 90 opera houses , 130 orchestras and numerous concert halls , germany is heaven for classical music fans .
but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .
what that will mean , however , is still up for discussion . uhde said that there were enough concert halls already in germany .
if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .
" and , in particular , there is a need for smaller flexible spaces alongside a large concert chamber , which you need , of course , for large symphony concerts .

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .
the location and size of the ship described by fonti corresponded to saturday 's find .
he had said that the vessel , the cunsky , was loaded with radioactive waste at the time .
authorities said they would carry out tests on the barrels to determine whether their contents were radioactive. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern and wolfsburg take early lead in cl group stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grafite is wolfburg 's goal machine both in the bundesliga and the cl german soccer teams bayern munich and vfl wolfsburg have won their opening matches in the champions league group phase .
experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .
however , italian side ac milan are in close pursuit after beating olympic marseille 2:1 in france .
in group d english side chelsea went to the top of the table after beating portuguese side fc porto 1:0 at stamford bridge .
atletico madrid failed to impress against greek side apoel nicosia with a goalless 0:0 draw .
there will be more champions league action on wedesday , with a total of eight matches in four more groups . germany 's vfb stuttgart will be taking on scottish side glasgow rangers in group g. nk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : matt zuvela send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.09.2009 eu foreign ministers stress the need for a legitimate government in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says the afghan vote must be legitimate european union foreign ministers have discussed a number of issues including the recent afghan elections and forming closer ties with nations in the southern caucasus region . high on the agenda at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday september 15 , was last month 's presidential election in afghanistan . the foreign ministers are faced with increasing public skepticism within the bloc about eu involvement in afghanistan and , thus , a credible outcome to the election is seen as crucial for future support .
" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 15.09.2009 social change transforms the classical concert in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classical concerts do n't always have to fit the same pattern with its 90 opera houses , 130 orchestras and numerous concert halls , germany is heaven for classical music fans .
but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .
what that will mean , however , is still up for discussion . uhde said that there were enough concert halls already in germany .
if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .
" and , in particular , there is a need for smaller flexible spaces alongside a large concert chamber , which you need , of course , for large symphony concerts .

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .
german minister for consumer protection ilse aigner said tuesday that more compensation was needed for the victims of the lehman collapse .

the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .
however , italian side ac milan are in close pursuit after beating olympic marseille 2:1 in france .
in group d english side chelsea went to the top of the table after beating portuguese side fc porto 1:0 at stamford bridge .
atletico madrid failed to impress against greek side apoel nicosia with a goalless 0:0 draw .
there will be more champions league action on wedesday , with a total of eight matches in four more groups . germany 's vfb stuttgart will be taking on scottish side glasgow rangers in group g. nk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : matt zuvela send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.09.2009 european proposals to beat financial crisis meet with criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers set off a chain reaction a year ago , the collapse of lehman brothers sparked the global financial crisis .
european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern and wolfsburg take early lead in cl group stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grafite is wolfburg 's goal machine both in the bundesliga and the cl german soccer teams bayern munich and vfl wolfsburg have won their opening matches in the champions league group phase .
experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .
however , italian side ac milan are in close pursuit after beating olympic marseille 2:1 in france .
in group d english side chelsea went to the top of the table after beating portuguese side fc porto 1:0 at stamford bridge .
atletico madrid failed to impress against greek side apoel nicosia with a goalless 0:0 draw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.09.2009 demonstrators call for money back one year after lehman collapse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors marched to lehman brothers ' former headquarters hundreds of small investors hit hard by the financial crisis have demonstrated across germany one year after the collapse of lehman brothers .
they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .

unions have blamed restructuring for the disquieting trend . the chairman and ceo of france telecom , didier lombard , has pledged to take measures aimed at stopping what he called " the infernal spiral of suicides " at the company by the end of the year .
plans include giving support to his executive staff and listening to the concerns of salaried employees .
" we really must stop this movement , " said lombard , as he prepared to meet with french labor minister xavier darcos to discuss the wave of suicides that has hit the company .
23 deaths since 2008 twenty-three employees have killed themselves since the beginning of 2008 .
the latest was friday , sept .
11 , when a 32-year-old woman jumped out of the window of her fourth-floor office in paris .
two days earlier , another employee stabbed himself in the stomach during a meeting . the incidents prompted labor minister darcos to call a meeting with ceo lombard to discuss working conditions at telecom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister darcos wants to know what 's wrong at france telekom union officials blame the company , saying restructuring , including the fact that some 22,000 jobs have been cut over the past several years , was at least partly responsible for the suicides .
they accuse management of failing to take measures to head off the problem .
" the crisis at france telecom is now a national problem , " said unions force ouvriere and cftc in a joint statement .
" full light must be shed on the causes of these tragedies and on the growing malaise within the company . "
looking for reasons president nicolas sarkozy 's chief of staff , claude gueant , told rtl radio : " it is the duty and obligation of the company and of the government , which is a powerful shareholder , to examine this issue . " " suicide is a very serious , very personal affair and we can not reduce this phenomenon at france telecom to an organizational problem at the company , " gueant told rtl .
however , the sarkozy administration has said that , in many of the cases , the suicides were based on personal reasons , and said telecom was not fully to blame for the deaths .
moreover , it was not clear if the total was more than could be expected in a population of 100,000 - the size of the company 's french workforce .
the 23 deaths in nearly two years compare with an overall french suicide rate of about 15 per 100,000 people per year .
still , telecom has begun taking steps to deal with the festering problem .
they have suspended 500 employee transfers that are a part of an ongoing reorganization , and have put out a call for employees to watch their colleagues for signs of depression .
“ there will be a clear message to all the managers to quickly organize local team meetings to explain what happened and what 's being done , and to make sure that , if there are problems , they can be discussed , " spokesman sebastien audra told reporters .
fighting the problem there area also plans to give workers the chance to talk to psychologists outside the company if they feel they are facing unsurmountable problems .
a committee will be set up to take an inventory of the situation , and the number of workplace physicians will be increased .

it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .
however , italian side ac milan are in close pursuit after beating olympic marseille 2:1 in france .
in group d english side chelsea went to the top of the table after beating portuguese side fc porto 1:0 at stamford bridge .
atletico madrid failed to impress against greek side apoel nicosia with a goalless 0:0 draw .

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .
german minister for consumer protection ilse aigner said tuesday that more compensation was needed for the victims of the lehman collapse .
" this does still not suffice , " she told radio station deutschlandradio kultur. dfm / afpd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .
the location and size of the ship described by fonti corresponded to saturday 's find .
he had said that the vessel , the cunsky , was loaded with radioactive waste at the time .
authorities said they would carry out tests on the barrels to determine whether their contents were radioactive. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .
the location and size of the ship described by fonti corresponded to saturday 's find .
he had said that the vessel , the cunsky , was loaded with radioactive waste at the time .
authorities said they would carry out tests on the barrels to determine whether their contents were radioactive. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.09.2009 eu foreign ministers stress the need for a legitimate government in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says the afghan vote must be legitimate european union foreign ministers have discussed a number of issues including the recent afghan elections and forming closer ties with nations in the southern caucasus region . high on the agenda at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday september 15 , was last month 's presidential election in afghanistan . the foreign ministers are faced with increasing public skepticism within the bloc about eu involvement in afghanistan and , thus , a credible outcome to the election is seen as crucial for future support .
" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern and wolfsburg take early lead in cl group stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grafite is wolfburg 's goal machine both in the bundesliga and the cl german soccer teams bayern munich and vfl wolfsburg have won their opening matches in the champions league group phase .
experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .
however , italian side ac milan are in close pursuit after beating olympic marseille 2:1 in france .
in group d english side chelsea went to the top of the table after beating portuguese side fc porto 1:0 at stamford bridge .
atletico madrid failed to impress against greek side apoel nicosia with a goalless 0:0 draw .
there will be more champions league action on wedesday , with a total of eight matches in four more groups . germany 's vfb stuttgart will be taking on scottish side glasgow rangers in group g. nk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : matt zuvela send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 15.09.2009 france telecom pledges to combat suicides , amid public pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecom has said it will offer therapy to those who need it top france telecom executives meet with government representatives to find remedies to a wave of suicides at the company .
unions have blamed restructuring for the disquieting trend . the chairman and ceo of france telecom , didier lombard , has pledged to take measures aimed at stopping what he called " the infernal spiral of suicides " at the company by the end of the year .
plans include giving support to his executive staff and listening to the concerns of salaried employees .
" we really must stop this movement , " said lombard , as he prepared to meet with french labor minister xavier darcos to discuss the wave of suicides that has hit the company .
23 deaths since 2008 twenty-three employees have killed themselves since the beginning of 2008 .
the latest was friday , sept .
11 , when a 32-year-old woman jumped out of the window of her fourth-floor office in paris .
two days earlier , another employee stabbed himself in the stomach during a meeting . the incidents prompted labor minister darcos to call a meeting with ceo lombard to discuss working conditions at telecom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister darcos wants to know what 's wrong at france telekom union officials blame the company , saying restructuring , including the fact that some 22,000 jobs have been cut over the past several years , was at least partly responsible for the suicides .
they accuse management of failing to take measures to head off the problem .
" the crisis at france telecom is now a national problem , " said unions force ouvriere and cftc in a joint statement .
" full light must be shed on the causes of these tragedies and on the growing malaise within the company . "
looking for reasons president nicolas sarkozy 's chief of staff , claude gueant , told rtl radio : " it is the duty and obligation of the company and of the government , which is a powerful shareholder , to examine this issue . " " suicide is a very serious , very personal affair and we can not reduce this phenomenon at france telecom to an organizational problem at the company , " gueant told rtl .
however , the sarkozy administration has said that , in many of the cases , the suicides were based on personal reasons , and said telecom was not fully to blame for the deaths .
moreover , it was not clear if the total was more than could be expected in a population of 100,000 - the size of the company 's french workforce .
the 23 deaths in nearly two years compare with an overall french suicide rate of about 15 per 100,000 people per year .
still , telecom has begun taking steps to deal with the festering problem .
they have suspended 500 employee transfers that are a part of an ongoing reorganization , and have put out a call for employees to watch their colleagues for signs of depression .
“ there will be a clear message to all the managers to quickly organize local team meetings to explain what happened and what 's being done , and to make sure that , if there are problems , they can be discussed , " spokesman sebastien audra told reporters .
fighting the problem there area also plans to give workers the chance to talk to psychologists outside the company if they feel they are facing unsurmountable problems .
a committee will be set up to take an inventory of the situation , and the number of workplace physicians will be increased .
" by the end of the year we should be able to start from a new basis , " lombard told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 15.09.2009 asia one year after lehman bros collapse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts think china could lead the world out of the financial crisis it was on 15th september last year that lehman brothers , the 158-year-old us investment bank , filed for bankruptcy .
the aftershocks of the collapse were felt worldwide .
although the economic crisis which followed is far from over , asia ’ s economies are showing signs of fast recovery , with china taking the lead . the economic crisis that followed the collapse of lehman brothers has been termed one of the worst since the great depression of the 1930s .
but while the united states continues to post poor consumer spending figures and depressing jobs data , the asian economies have already started looking up .
kyohei morita , the chief economist at barclays capital in tokyo , explained that “ the reason why asia could be the source of recovery for the global economy is because they were basically the beneficiaries of the global economic policies taken by the major economies especially .
the most notable example is the stimulus of the purchases of cars or autos or electrical appliances because asia can be regarded as the factory of these goods . ”
quick response to crisis ashok charan , a professor at national university of singapore , added that the asian governments , especially beijing , are recovering because they reacted very promptly .
especially , china which “ was very quick to respond to the crisis with a very large and substantial stimulus package by the government .
they were the first to show signs of bottoming out .
the developing world - china and india - are doing a bit better . ”
charan also thinks that increased domestic spending in the region has helped the asian economies recover faster than their western counterparts : “ the biggest potential for the government in particular was through triggering the domestic consumption because the chinese had amassed a huge sum in terms of savings .
the total savings in private and corporate in public china was to the tune of about 4.3 trillion us dollars which , compared to any other large economy , was really huge . traditionally , chinese have had the propensity to save . ”
emerging middle classes in china and india recently , the world bank lauded china for its measures that prevented the crisis from getting worse .
“ china as a whole continues to grow at 8 percent and india is expected to grow at 5.5 percent , ” charan explained .
“ over the years , in any case for the past 10 to 15 years , and this will go on for the future 10 to 20 years , both china and india have witnessed the emergence of the middle and upper middle class .
we asians are after all about 60 percent of the world ’ s population in terms of size and diversity and we are rapidly urbanising , ” he added .
kyohei morita of barclays capital in tokyo agreed : “ we still have at least 15 years of population growth without aging .
i would say that the savings ratio will not fall - at least over the coming 15 years . ”
“ it may take a few years before the us becomes as large a market as it was , ” warned charan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 15.09.2009 asia one year after lehman bros collapse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts think china could lead the world out of the financial crisis it was on 15th september last year that lehman brothers , the 158-year-old us investment bank , filed for bankruptcy .
the aftershocks of the collapse were felt worldwide .
although the economic crisis which followed is far from over , asia ’ s economies are showing signs of fast recovery , with china taking the lead . the economic crisis that followed the collapse of lehman brothers has been termed one of the worst since the great depression of the 1930s .
but while the united states continues to post poor consumer spending figures and depressing jobs data , the asian economies have already started looking up .
kyohei morita , the chief economist at barclays capital in tokyo , explained that “ the reason why asia could be the source of recovery for the global economy is because they were basically the beneficiaries of the global economic policies taken by the major economies especially .
the most notable example is the stimulus of the purchases of cars or autos or electrical appliances because asia can be regarded as the factory of these goods . ”
quick response to crisis ashok charan , a professor at national university of singapore , added that the asian governments , especially beijing , are recovering because they reacted very promptly .
especially , china which “ was very quick to respond to the crisis with a very large and substantial stimulus package by the government .
they were the first to show signs of bottoming out .
the developing world - china and india - are doing a bit better . ”
charan also thinks that increased domestic spending in the region has helped the asian economies recover faster than their western counterparts : “ the biggest potential for the government in particular was through triggering the domestic consumption because the chinese had amassed a huge sum in terms of savings .
the total savings in private and corporate in public china was to the tune of about 4.3 trillion us dollars which , compared to any other large economy , was really huge . traditionally , chinese have had the propensity to save . ”
emerging middle classes in china and india recently , the world bank lauded china for its measures that prevented the crisis from getting worse .
“ china as a whole continues to grow at 8 percent and india is expected to grow at 5.5 percent , ” charan explained .
“ over the years , in any case for the past 10 to 15 years , and this will go on for the future 10 to 20 years , both china and india have witnessed the emergence of the middle and upper middle class .
we asians are after all about 60 percent of the world ’ s population in terms of size and diversity and we are rapidly urbanising , ” he added .
kyohei morita of barclays capital in tokyo agreed : “ we still have at least 15 years of population growth without aging .
i would say that the savings ratio will not fall - at least over the coming 15 years . ”
“ it may take a few years before the us becomes as large a market as it was , ” warned charan .
“ so some realignment may take place and may go beyond asia , brazil and russia as well .
asia is not just china and india - there ’ s indonesia , which is clearly doing pretty very well at this moment and there ’ s vietnam , which is growing faster . ”

but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .

" these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .

but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .
what that will mean , however , is still up for discussion . uhde said that there were enough concert halls already in germany .
if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .
" and , in particular , there is a need for smaller flexible spaces alongside a large concert chamber , which you need , of course , for large symphony concerts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2009 desertification should not take a back seat to climate change debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worldwide desertification continues at a rapid pace the importance of fighting desertification is in danger of being overlooked by the attention given to climate change negotiations scheduled for the end of the year , science and technology expert steffen bauer writes . if we take a look beyond the current din of the campaigning here in germany , the term " copenhagen " seems to be everywhere .
the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .

the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .

the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 15.09.2009 german opposition leaders upstage merkel and steinmeier in tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle , trittin and lafontaine -lrb- from left -rrb- faced off monday in a lively tv debate the leaders of germany 's opposition parties have underlined their determination to topple the grand coalition in the sept .
27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

the new report , chaired by the american nobel prize-winning economist joseph stiglitz , has recommended a shift away from using gross domestic product , or gdp , as the sole focus for gauging prosperity .
gdp measures a country 's total output of goods and services at market prices .
it has often been criticized as an overly narrow indicator that ignores wider factors , such as environmental degradation , people 's health , workplace safety , job security , vacation time and a population 's general degree of happiness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stiglitz views gdp as outdated many view gdp as an antiquated standard stiglitz stressed that there was " no single indicator that can capture something as complex as our society .
but because what we choose to measure and how we construct our measures can have such an important role in the decisions that are made , it is important that there be an open and public discussion of our system of metrics . "
oecd secretary general angel gurria seconded those notions and said " economic resources are not all that matter in people 's lives .
we need better measures of people 's expectations and levels of satisfaction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic resources are not all that matter , says oecd 's gurria one of a number of problems is that ultimately harmful economic activity actually raises a nation 's gdp .
a country that cuts down all its trees and sells the wood increases its gross domestic product , but over the long term it is destroying its natural resources to the detriment of its citizens and the environment .
until now , this has never been measured .
the same is true for wasting energy .
sarkozy said his intention was " to put this report on the agenda of all international meetings , and to fight for all international organizations to modify their statistical systems based on the recommendations of the commission . "
the french president has been one of the most vocal critics calling for an overhaul of the global economic system .
he has repeatedly demanded tighter controls for financial markets and an end to the big bonuses which have been blamed for the excessive risk-taking that led to the global economic crisis .
" for years , we have been telling people that their living standards are getting better , while at the same time their lives were growing more difficult , " sarkozy said .
" we must understand the people who have lost their homes , their jobs and some of their pensions in the wake of the financial crisis and who feel they have been cheated , although it is not their fault . "
' wrong measurement or wrong numbers ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quality of life is more than just economic output professor jean-paul fitoussi , one of the 37 economic experts who worked on the stiglitz report , summed up the problem with the gdp measurement , saying that " when numbers tell us we are doing well , while people feel the floor collapsing under their feet , then either the measurement standard is wrong , or we are using the wrong numbers . "
this is why sarkozy wants to see the recommendations made by the economic panel implemented in france immediately and put on the g-20 agenda .
all economic data in future would be weighted according to environmental and social welfare criteria .
the production of goods and services would no longer be the standard for measuring a country 's well-being , but would include the development of personal and family incomes , the state of roads and other infrastructure , energy use , public safety , education , and the overall quality of life. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also , statements by the svp had led to " deep anxiety within swiss society and within minority groups . "
ecri also noted that unemployment among foreigners , who make up a fifth of the population , was in some places as much as three times that of natives .

but " at the same time , there has been a disturbing intensification in the activities of the extreme right-wing milieu in the czech republic , including the setting up of a uniformed paramilitary group by one political party , " it said in a report .

27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .

they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .

unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .

his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .

they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .

the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .

unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .

in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .

meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

ecri also noted that unemployment among foreigners , who make up a fifth of the population , was in some places as much as three times that of natives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2009 desertification should not take a back seat to climate change debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worldwide desertification continues at a rapid pace the importance of fighting desertification is in danger of being overlooked by the attention given to climate change negotiations scheduled for the end of the year , science and technology expert steffen bauer writes . if we take a look beyond the current din of the campaigning here in germany , the term " copenhagen " seems to be everywhere .
the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .
what that will mean , however , is still up for discussion . uhde said that there were enough concert halls already in germany .
if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .
" and , in particular , there is a need for smaller flexible spaces alongside a large concert chamber , which you need , of course , for large symphony concerts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.09.2009 european proposals to beat financial crisis meet with criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers set off a chain reaction a year ago , the collapse of lehman brothers sparked the global financial crisis .
european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .

some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .

" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .

" the mission concluded that actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly in some respects crimes against humanity , were committed by the israel defense force , " said u.n. investigator richard goldstone to reporters .
he called on the un to insist that both israel and the palestinians launch investigations to get to the bottom of the charges .
israel immediately responded to the statement and said that the report was one-sided and did not take into account the thousands of hamas militant missile attacks on its civilian population .
it had refused to cooperate with the investigation , saying that the un human rights council was biased against the jewish state .
" both the mandate of the mission and the resolution establishing it prejudged the outcome of any investigation , gave legitimacy to the hamas terrorist organization and disregarded the deliberate hamas strategy of using palestinian civilians as cover for launching terrorist attacks , " said a statement on the israeli foreign ministry web site .
the hostilities killed more than 1,400 palestinians and , according to human rights groups , at least 900 of them were civilians .
the israelis lost 10 soldiers and three civilians .
the report is based on nearly 200 interviews and more than 20,000 documents .

he urged both sides to conduct formal investigations , and said that if neither side did , the security council should refer the matter to the international criminal court in the hague .
goldstone brushed away accusations of being biased against israel and pointed out his long-standing ties with israel , including his own jewish heritage .
the israeli foreign ministry , while blasting the report , said that it would be examined .

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern and wolfsburg take early lead in cl group stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grafite is wolfburg 's goal machine both in the bundesliga and the cl german soccer teams bayern munich and vfl wolfsburg have won their opening matches in the champions league group phase .
experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .
however , italian side ac milan are in close pursuit after beating olympic marseille 2:1 in france .
in group d english side chelsea went to the top of the table after beating portuguese side fc porto 1:0 at stamford bridge .
atletico madrid failed to impress against greek side apoel nicosia with a goalless 0:0 draw .
there will be more champions league action on wedesday , with a total of eight matches in four more groups . germany 's vfb stuttgart will be taking on scottish side glasgow rangers in group g. nk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : matt zuvela send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.09.2009 eu foreign ministers stress the need for a legitimate government in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says the afghan vote must be legitimate european union foreign ministers have discussed a number of issues including the recent afghan elections and forming closer ties with nations in the southern caucasus region . high on the agenda at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday september 15 , was last month 's presidential election in afghanistan . the foreign ministers are faced with increasing public skepticism within the bloc about eu involvement in afghanistan and , thus , a credible outcome to the election is seen as crucial for future support .
" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .

currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

plavsic had pleaded guilty to " inviting paramilitaries from serbia to assist bosnian serb forces in effecting ethnic separation by force " on political , racial and religious grounds .
the court had dropped charges of genocide , extermination and murder in return for her guilty plea .
the 79-year-old is the highest ranking official from the former yugoslavia to have acknowledged ordering atrocities perpetrated in the 1990 wars that sprang from the breakup of the yugoslav federation .
prior to the charges being dropped against her , plavsic had been one of three bosnian serb leaders , including radovan karadzic , due to face trial in october on multiple counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , such as those committed in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-herzegovina in july 1995 .

munira subasic , the head of an association of survivors of the 1995 srebrenica massacre , said the only explanation for plavsic 's release was that " the world supports crime and criminals . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 15.09.2009 social change transforms the classical concert in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classical concerts do n't always have to fit the same pattern with its 90 opera houses , 130 orchestras and numerous concert halls , germany is heaven for classical music fans .
but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .
what that will mean , however , is still up for discussion . uhde said that there were enough concert halls already in germany .
if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .
" and , in particular , there is a need for smaller flexible spaces alongside a large concert chamber , which you need , of course , for large symphony concerts .

but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .

" these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .

if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .
german minister for consumer protection ilse aigner said tuesday that more compensation was needed for the victims of the lehman collapse .
" this does still not suffice , " she told radio station deutschlandradio kultur. dfm / afpd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 15.09.2009 social change transforms the classical concert in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classical concerts do n't always have to fit the same pattern with its 90 opera houses , 130 orchestras and numerous concert halls , germany is heaven for classical music fans .
but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .
what that will mean , however , is still up for discussion . uhde said that there were enough concert halls already in germany .
if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .
" and , in particular , there is a need for smaller flexible spaces alongside a large concert chamber , which you need , of course , for large symphony concerts .

27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .

their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .
german minister for consumer protection ilse aigner said tuesday that more compensation was needed for the victims of the lehman collapse .
" this does still not suffice , " she told radio station deutschlandradio kultur. dfm / afpd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .
however , italian side ac milan are in close pursuit after beating olympic marseille 2:1 in france .
in group d english side chelsea went to the top of the table after beating portuguese side fc porto 1:0 at stamford bridge .
atletico madrid failed to impress against greek side apoel nicosia with a goalless 0:0 draw .
there will be more champions league action on wedesday , with a total of eight matches in four more groups . germany 's vfb stuttgart will be taking on scottish side glasgow rangers in group g. nk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : matt zuvela send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .

the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .

in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .

meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.09.2009 sarkozy calls for a new international prosperity barometer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants a new definition of prosperity french president nicolas sarkozy has urged the international community to use new ways to measure economic prosperity with more emphasis on the environment and a nation 's social well-being . a panel of experts , set up by sarkozy to work on a set of proposals for a new system to measure economic growth , presented its findings in paris on monday ahead of next week 's g-20 summit in the united states .
the new report , chaired by the american nobel prize-winning economist joseph stiglitz , has recommended a shift away from using gross domestic product , or gdp , as the sole focus for gauging prosperity .
gdp measures a country 's total output of goods and services at market prices .
it has often been criticized as an overly narrow indicator that ignores wider factors , such as environmental degradation , people 's health , workplace safety , job security , vacation time and a population 's general degree of happiness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stiglitz views gdp as outdated many view gdp as an antiquated standard stiglitz stressed that there was " no single indicator that can capture something as complex as our society .
but because what we choose to measure and how we construct our measures can have such an important role in the decisions that are made , it is important that there be an open and public discussion of our system of metrics . "
oecd secretary general angel gurria seconded those notions and said " economic resources are not all that matter in people 's lives .
we need better measures of people 's expectations and levels of satisfaction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic resources are not all that matter , says oecd 's gurria one of a number of problems is that ultimately harmful economic activity actually raises a nation 's gdp .
a country that cuts down all its trees and sells the wood increases its gross domestic product , but over the long term it is destroying its natural resources to the detriment of its citizens and the environment .
until now , this has never been measured .
the same is true for wasting energy .
sarkozy said his intention was " to put this report on the agenda of all international meetings , and to fight for all international organizations to modify their statistical systems based on the recommendations of the commission . "
the french president has been one of the most vocal critics calling for an overhaul of the global economic system .
he has repeatedly demanded tighter controls for financial markets and an end to the big bonuses which have been blamed for the excessive risk-taking that led to the global economic crisis .
" for years , we have been telling people that their living standards are getting better , while at the same time their lives were growing more difficult , " sarkozy said .
" we must understand the people who have lost their homes , their jobs and some of their pensions in the wake of the financial crisis and who feel they have been cheated , although it is not their fault . "
' wrong measurement or wrong numbers ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quality of life is more than just economic output professor jean-paul fitoussi , one of the 37 economic experts who worked on the stiglitz report , summed up the problem with the gdp measurement , saying that " when numbers tell us we are doing well , while people feel the floor collapsing under their feet , then either the measurement standard is wrong , or we are using the wrong numbers . "
this is why sarkozy wants to see the recommendations made by the economic panel implemented in france immediately and put on the g-20 agenda .
all economic data in future would be weighted according to environmental and social welfare criteria .
the production of goods and services would no longer be the standard for measuring a country 's well-being , but would include the development of personal and family incomes , the state of roads and other infrastructure , energy use , public safety , education , and the overall quality of life. gb / ap / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .
what that will mean , however , is still up for discussion . uhde said that there were enough concert halls already in germany .
if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .
" and , in particular , there is a need for smaller flexible spaces alongside a large concert chamber , which you need , of course , for large symphony concerts .

but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .
what that will mean , however , is still up for discussion . uhde said that there were enough concert halls already in germany .
if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .
" and , in particular , there is a need for smaller flexible spaces alongside a large concert chamber , which you need , of course , for large symphony concerts .

unions have blamed restructuring for the disquieting trend . the chairman and ceo of france telecom , didier lombard , has pledged to take measures aimed at stopping what he called " the infernal spiral of suicides " at the company by the end of the year .
plans include giving support to his executive staff and listening to the concerns of salaried employees .
" we really must stop this movement , " said lombard , as he prepared to meet with french labor minister xavier darcos to discuss the wave of suicides that has hit the company .
23 deaths since 2008 twenty-three employees have killed themselves since the beginning of 2008 .
the latest was friday , sept .
11 , when a 32-year-old woman jumped out of the window of her fourth-floor office in paris .
two days earlier , another employee stabbed himself in the stomach during a meeting . the incidents prompted labor minister darcos to call a meeting with ceo lombard to discuss working conditions at telecom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister darcos wants to know what 's wrong at france telekom union officials blame the company , saying restructuring , including the fact that some 22,000 jobs have been cut over the past several years , was at least partly responsible for the suicides .
they accuse management of failing to take measures to head off the problem .
" the crisis at france telecom is now a national problem , " said unions force ouvriere and cftc in a joint statement .
" full light must be shed on the causes of these tragedies and on the growing malaise within the company . "
looking for reasons president nicolas sarkozy 's chief of staff , claude gueant , told rtl radio : " it is the duty and obligation of the company and of the government , which is a powerful shareholder , to examine this issue . " " suicide is a very serious , very personal affair and we can not reduce this phenomenon at france telecom to an organizational problem at the company , " gueant told rtl .
however , the sarkozy administration has said that , in many of the cases , the suicides were based on personal reasons , and said telecom was not fully to blame for the deaths .
moreover , it was not clear if the total was more than could be expected in a population of 100,000 - the size of the company 's french workforce .
the 23 deaths in nearly two years compare with an overall french suicide rate of about 15 per 100,000 people per year .
still , telecom has begun taking steps to deal with the festering problem .
they have suspended 500 employee transfers that are a part of an ongoing reorganization , and have put out a call for employees to watch their colleagues for signs of depression .
“ there will be a clear message to all the managers to quickly organize local team meetings to explain what happened and what 's being done , and to make sure that , if there are problems , they can be discussed , " spokesman sebastien audra told reporters .
fighting the problem there area also plans to give workers the chance to talk to psychologists outside the company if they feel they are facing unsurmountable problems .
a committee will be set up to take an inventory of the situation , and the number of workplace physicians will be increased .
" by the end of the year we should be able to start from a new basis , " lombard told reporters .

the decision has angered bosnian muslim groups . plavsic , known as the " iron lady " , has served two-thirds of her sentence and will be eligible for parole in october under laws in sweden , where she is being detained .
in 2003 , she was convicted of the persecution of croats and bosnian muslims in the bosnian war , which raged from 1992 to 1995 .
plavsic had pleaded guilty to " inviting paramilitaries from serbia to assist bosnian serb forces in effecting ethnic separation by force " on political , racial and religious grounds .
the court had dropped charges of genocide , extermination and murder in return for her guilty plea .
the 79-year-old is the highest ranking official from the former yugoslavia to have acknowledged ordering atrocities perpetrated in the 1990 wars that sprang from the breakup of the yugoslav federation .
prior to the charges being dropped against her , plavsic had been one of three bosnian serb leaders , including radovan karadzic , due to face trial in october on multiple counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , such as those committed in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-herzegovina in july 1995 .
outrage over release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims gather every year to mourn srebrenica an estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys were massacred in srebrenica by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units .
muslim victims of the bosnian war were outraged tuesday by the decision taken by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to release plavsic .
" how can we explain this to children whose parents had been killed -lrb- in serb-run -rrb- camps -rrb- - children who remember their parents only from photos ? news agency afp quoted murat tahirovic , the head of an association of muslim and croat war camp prisoners , as asking .
munira subasic , the head of an association of survivors of the 1995 srebrenica massacre , said the only explanation for plavsic 's release was that " the world supports crime and criminals . "
" how is it possible that plavsic has the right to freedom and i do not have the right to find and bury the bones of my son 14 years after he was brutally killed ? " she asked. dfm / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision has angered bosnian muslim groups . plavsic , known as the " iron lady " , has served two-thirds of her sentence and will be eligible for parole in october under laws in sweden , where she is being detained .
in 2003 , she was convicted of the persecution of croats and bosnian muslims in the bosnian war , which raged from 1992 to 1995 .
plavsic had pleaded guilty to " inviting paramilitaries from serbia to assist bosnian serb forces in effecting ethnic separation by force " on political , racial and religious grounds .
the court had dropped charges of genocide , extermination and murder in return for her guilty plea .
the 79-year-old is the highest ranking official from the former yugoslavia to have acknowledged ordering atrocities perpetrated in the 1990 wars that sprang from the breakup of the yugoslav federation .
prior to the charges being dropped against her , plavsic had been one of three bosnian serb leaders , including radovan karadzic , due to face trial in october on multiple counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , such as those committed in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-herzegovina in july 1995 .

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .
german minister for consumer protection ilse aigner said tuesday that more compensation was needed for the victims of the lehman collapse .
" this does still not suffice , " she told radio station deutschlandradio kultur. dfm / afpd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" both the mandate of the mission and the resolution establishing it prejudged the outcome of any investigation , gave legitimacy to the hamas terrorist organization and disregarded the deliberate hamas strategy of using palestinian civilians as cover for launching terrorist attacks , " said a statement on the israeli foreign ministry web site .
the hostilities killed more than 1,400 palestinians and , according to human rights groups , at least 900 of them were civilians .
the israelis lost 10 soldiers and three civilians .
the report is based on nearly 200 interviews and more than 20,000 documents .

" the mission concluded that actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly in some respects crimes against humanity , were committed by the israel defense force , " said u.n. investigator richard goldstone to reporters .
he called on the un to insist that both israel and the palestinians launch investigations to get to the bottom of the charges .

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .
the location and size of the ship described by fonti corresponded to saturday 's find .
he had said that the vessel , the cunsky , was loaded with radioactive waste at the time .
authorities said they would carry out tests on the barrels to determine whether their contents were radioactive. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern and wolfsburg take early lead in cl group stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grafite is wolfburg 's goal machine both in the bundesliga and the cl german soccer teams bayern munich and vfl wolfsburg have won their opening matches in the champions league group phase .
experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .
however , italian side ac milan are in close pursuit after beating olympic marseille 2:1 in france .
in group d english side chelsea went to the top of the table after beating portuguese side fc porto 1:0 at stamford bridge .
atletico madrid failed to impress against greek side apoel nicosia with a goalless 0:0 draw .
there will be more champions league action on wedesday , with a total of eight matches in four more groups . germany 's vfb stuttgart will be taking on scottish side glasgow rangers in group g. nk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : matt zuvela send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

" the mission concluded that actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly in some respects crimes against humanity , were committed by the israel defense force , " said u.n. investigator richard goldstone to reporters .
he called on the un to insist that both israel and the palestinians launch investigations to get to the bottom of the charges .
israel immediately responded to the statement and said that the report was one-sided and did not take into account the thousands of hamas militant missile attacks on its civilian population .
it had refused to cooperate with the investigation , saying that the un human rights council was biased against the jewish state .
" both the mandate of the mission and the resolution establishing it prejudged the outcome of any investigation , gave legitimacy to the hamas terrorist organization and disregarded the deliberate hamas strategy of using palestinian civilians as cover for launching terrorist attacks , " said a statement on the israeli foreign ministry web site .
the hostilities killed more than 1,400 palestinians and , according to human rights groups , at least 900 of them were civilians .
the israelis lost 10 soldiers and three civilians .
the report is based on nearly 200 interviews and more than 20,000 documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge richard goldstone rejects israeli criticism of his team 's findings goldstone said that , while the palestinians had not conducted any investigations into the clash at all , israel 's investigations were , in the words of the report , not credible .
he urged both sides to conduct formal investigations , and said that if neither side did , the security council should refer the matter to the international criminal court in the hague .
goldstone brushed away accusations of being biased against israel and pointed out his long-standing ties with israel , including his own jewish heritage .
the israeli foreign ministry , while blasting the report , said that it would be examined .
" notwithstanding its reservations , israel will read the report carefully - as it does with all reports prepared by international and national organizations .
israel is committed to acting fully in accordance with international law and to examining any allegations of wrongdoing by its own forces , " said the statement. av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 15.09.2009 social change transforms the classical concert in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classical concerts do n't always have to fit the same pattern with its 90 opera houses , 130 orchestras and numerous concert halls , germany is heaven for classical music fans .
but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .

but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .
what that will mean , however , is still up for discussion . uhde said that there were enough concert halls already in germany .
if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .
" and , in particular , there is a need for smaller flexible spaces alongside a large concert chamber , which you need , of course , for large symphony concerts .

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .
german minister for consumer protection ilse aigner said tuesday that more compensation was needed for the victims of the lehman collapse .
" this does still not suffice , " she told radio station deutschlandradio kultur. dfm / afpd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .
the location and size of the ship described by fonti corresponded to saturday 's find .
he had said that the vessel , the cunsky , was loaded with radioactive waste at the time .
authorities said they would carry out tests on the barrels to determine whether their contents were radioactive. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 15.09.2009 german opposition leaders upstage merkel and steinmeier in tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle , trittin and lafontaine -lrb- from left -rrb- faced off monday in a lively tv debate the leaders of germany 's opposition parties have underlined their determination to topple the grand coalition in the sept .
27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .
however , italian side ac milan are in close pursuit after beating olympic marseille 2:1 in france .
in group d english side chelsea went to the top of the table after beating portuguese side fc porto 1:0 at stamford bridge .
atletico madrid failed to impress against greek side apoel nicosia with a goalless 0:0 draw .
there will be more champions league action on wedesday , with a total of eight matches in four more groups . germany 's vfb stuttgart will be taking on scottish side glasgow rangers in group g. nk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : matt zuvela send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern munich roaring into champions league , wolfsburg and stuttgart limping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger and bayern are beginning to click as the champions league kicks off , last year 's runners-up from bavaria are surging .
meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.09.2009 eu foreign ministers stress the need for a legitimate government in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says the afghan vote must be legitimate european union foreign ministers have discussed a number of issues including the recent afghan elections and forming closer ties with nations in the southern caucasus region . high on the agenda at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday september 15 , was last month 's presidential election in afghanistan . the foreign ministers are faced with increasing public skepticism within the bloc about eu involvement in afghanistan and , thus , a credible outcome to the election is seen as crucial for future support .
" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision has angered bosnian muslim groups . plavsic , known as the " iron lady " , has served two-thirds of her sentence and will be eligible for parole in october under laws in sweden , where she is being detained .
in 2003 , she was convicted of the persecution of croats and bosnian muslims in the bosnian war , which raged from 1992 to 1995 .
plavsic had pleaded guilty to " inviting paramilitaries from serbia to assist bosnian serb forces in effecting ethnic separation by force " on political , racial and religious grounds .
the court had dropped charges of genocide , extermination and murder in return for her guilty plea .
the 79-year-old is the highest ranking official from the former yugoslavia to have acknowledged ordering atrocities perpetrated in the 1990 wars that sprang from the breakup of the yugoslav federation .
prior to the charges being dropped against her , plavsic had been one of three bosnian serb leaders , including radovan karadzic , due to face trial in october on multiple counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , such as those committed in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-herzegovina in july 1995 .

munira subasic , the head of an association of survivors of the 1995 srebrenica massacre , said the only explanation for plavsic 's release was that " the world supports crime and criminals . "

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .
the location and size of the ship described by fonti corresponded to saturday 's find .
he had said that the vessel , the cunsky , was loaded with radioactive waste at the time .
authorities said they would carry out tests on the barrels to determine whether their contents were radioactive. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2009 desertification should not take a back seat to climate change debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worldwide desertification continues at a rapid pace the importance of fighting desertification is in danger of being overlooked by the attention given to climate change negotiations scheduled for the end of the year , science and technology expert steffen bauer writes . if we take a look beyond the current din of the campaigning here in germany , the term " copenhagen " seems to be everywhere .
the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .

in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .

while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern munich roaring into champions league , wolfsburg and stuttgart limping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger and bayern are beginning to click as the champions league kicks off , last year 's runners-up from bavaria are surging .
meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern munich roaring into champions league , wolfsburg and stuttgart limping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger and bayern are beginning to click as the champions league kicks off , last year 's runners-up from bavaria are surging .
meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .
german minister for consumer protection ilse aigner said tuesday that more compensation was needed for the victims of the lehman collapse .
" this does still not suffice , " she told radio station deutschlandradio kultur. dfm / afpd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .

ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .

" the mission concluded that actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly in some respects crimes against humanity , were committed by the israel defense force , " said u.n. investigator richard goldstone to reporters .
he called on the un to insist that both israel and the palestinians launch investigations to get to the bottom of the charges .
israel immediately responded to the statement and said that the report was one-sided and did not take into account the thousands of hamas militant missile attacks on its civilian population .
it had refused to cooperate with the investigation , saying that the un human rights council was biased against the jewish state .
" both the mandate of the mission and the resolution establishing it prejudged the outcome of any investigation , gave legitimacy to the hamas terrorist organization and disregarded the deliberate hamas strategy of using palestinian civilians as cover for launching terrorist attacks , " said a statement on the israeli foreign ministry web site .
the hostilities killed more than 1,400 palestinians and , according to human rights groups , at least 900 of them were civilians .
the israelis lost 10 soldiers and three civilians .
the report is based on nearly 200 interviews and more than 20,000 documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge richard goldstone rejects israeli criticism of his team 's findings goldstone said that , while the palestinians had not conducted any investigations into the clash at all , israel 's investigations were , in the words of the report , not credible .
he urged both sides to conduct formal investigations , and said that if neither side did , the security council should refer the matter to the international criminal court in the hague .
goldstone brushed away accusations of being biased against israel and pointed out his long-standing ties with israel , including his own jewish heritage .
the israeli foreign ministry , while blasting the report , said that it would be examined .
" notwithstanding its reservations , israel will read the report carefully - as it does with all reports prepared by international and national organizations .
israel is committed to acting fully in accordance with international law and to examining any allegations of wrongdoing by its own forces , " said the statement. av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .
wolfsburg 's most dangerous rivals in group b are manchester united who also clinched three points on tuesday after a 1:0 away victory against turkish side besiktas istanbul .
bayern 's mueller does it again the second german team to play on tuesday was bayern munich .
the bavarians managed to grab three points in group a with a 3:0 away victory against israeli side maccabi haifa .
however , bayern 's defense was far from solid and other key players also failed to live up to expectations .
franck ribery 's performance was particularly disappointing , and dutch coach louis van gaal replaced the french midfielder with german striker mario gomez in the 64th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though his team won , ribery had little to celebrate on tuesday it took bayern over an hour to crack the israeli defense with a goal by defender daniel van buyten in the 64th minute .
however , bayern 's 20-year-old newcomer thomas mueller shone again on tuesday by repeating his weekend double in the german bundesliga with two goals in the 85th and 88th minute .
" we had difficulties .
we were happy after the first goal .
my goals were just a safeguard , " said mueller .
" i think we played an excellent first half but without making any goals .
in the second half we lost too many balls and things were a little disorganized .
i changed that and in the end we scored , " said van gaal .
bayern 's main contender to head the group is juventus turin , but the italians on home turf only managed a 1:1 draw against french side girodins bordeaux , giving bayern a two point lead in group a. madrid and chelsea take the lead in group c spanish side real madrid went to the top of the table with a stinging but unsurprising 5:2 victory over swiss team zurich .

experienced bayern had more difficulty against an easier opponent than wolfsburg in their debut . wolfsburg 's debut in the champions league was off to a good start in group b after the team of coach armin veh beat cska moscow 3:1 on tuesday evening .
brazilian star striker grafite , who scored 28 goals last season to help his team win the german title , was the uncontested man of the match with a hat trick .
he first scored in the 36th minute after a perfectly timed pass from zvjezdan misimovic .
just five minutes later the brazilian converted a penalty after being downed by moscow defender deividas semberas .
the three-time russian champs and 2005 uefa cup winners were too tame to jeopardize wolfsburg in earnest .
however , after taking the 2:0 lead , the germans withdrew a little , and this was punished by moscow 's alan dzagoev who scored in the 77th minute .
as a result , wolfsburg turned up the heat again , pinning the russians down in their own half .
misimovic could have delivered the knockout blow in the 85th minute but he failed to get past moscow 's keeper igor akinfeev .
this was left to grafite who dashed all russian hopes of a draw by netting two minutes later .
bildunterschrift : grafite scored all three goals against moscow " it was a special night , an unforgettable night , " grafite told reporters .
" i am very happy i got three goals and it is a fantastic feeling .
but we must keep our feet on the ground . "
" it was n't an exhilarating match but that 's not what we were after anyway .
we wanted to play with a solid defense and win the game .
we were the better team , gave the russians hardly any leeway and deserved to win , " said wolfsburg coach armin veh .

" the mission concluded that actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly in some respects crimes against humanity , were committed by the israel defense force , " said u.n. investigator richard goldstone to reporters .
he called on the un to insist that both israel and the palestinians launch investigations to get to the bottom of the charges .
israel immediately responded to the statement and said that the report was one-sided and did not take into account the thousands of hamas militant missile attacks on its civilian population .
it had refused to cooperate with the investigation , saying that the un human rights council was biased against the jewish state .
" both the mandate of the mission and the resolution establishing it prejudged the outcome of any investigation , gave legitimacy to the hamas terrorist organization and disregarded the deliberate hamas strategy of using palestinian civilians as cover for launching terrorist attacks , " said a statement on the israeli foreign ministry web site .
the hostilities killed more than 1,400 palestinians and , according to human rights groups , at least 900 of them were civilians .
the israelis lost 10 soldiers and three civilians .
the report is based on nearly 200 interviews and more than 20,000 documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge richard goldstone rejects israeli criticism of his team 's findings goldstone said that , while the palestinians had not conducted any investigations into the clash at all , israel 's investigations were , in the words of the report , not credible .
he urged both sides to conduct formal investigations , and said that if neither side did , the security council should refer the matter to the international criminal court in the hague .
goldstone brushed away accusations of being biased against israel and pointed out his long-standing ties with israel , including his own jewish heritage .
the israeli foreign ministry , while blasting the report , said that it would be examined .
" notwithstanding its reservations , israel will read the report carefully - as it does with all reports prepared by international and national organizations .
israel is committed to acting fully in accordance with international law and to examining any allegations of wrongdoing by its own forces , " said the statement. av / dpa / reuters / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .
the location and size of the ship described by fonti corresponded to saturday 's find .
he had said that the vessel , the cunsky , was loaded with radioactive waste at the time .
authorities said they would carry out tests on the barrels to determine whether their contents were radioactive. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .

" these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .

if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .

but changes are in store for this unique musical landscape , experts say . demographic and cultural changes in german society are bound to have an impact on the shape of concerts , orchestras and even concert halls in the years to come .
this was the general consensus at a conference taking place as part of the beethovenfest in bonn . traditional concerts with overtures , concertos and symphonies will continue to exist in years to come , according to the managing director of the german orchestra association , gerald mertens , but not at the exclusion of everything else . rejuvenating audiences " there will also be new types of concerts : commentated concerts , concerts that involve young artists , school classes , the handicapped and the elderly , " he said .
" by tapping into new audiences , orchestras will open up an extraordinary potential for the future . " attracting young audiences is already seen as an important part of the work of most orchestras , and it is bearing fruit .
but more can be done , for example in getting young people from migrant families involved , according to mertens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orchestras are looking to diversify audiences one way , he said , would be to incorporate more crossover projects with music from different cultures in the repertoires of the future .
he would also like to see more contemporary music on concert programs . german orchestras are already in a process of transformation , contracting by around 20 percent since 1990 as a result of closures and fusions .
financial pressures have mainly affected small and medium-size orchestras up to now . profiting from change but big orchestras are unlikely to be spared in the long-term and they could also profit from change , according to folke uhde , managing and artistic director of berlin 's radialsystem , a new creative space for the arts . he warned of the threat of absolute paralysis if the existing unwieldy system were not forced open in some way . " these apparatuses are getting bigger and bigger and more and more expensive with every collective bargaining round , and every year there is a reduction in flexibility because there are no spare resources to support young musicians and good ideas , or to launch initiatives , " said uhde . the managing director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen , albert schmitt , also sees a need for reform .
he said he would like to see the musicians themselves being more involved in managerial processes and also taking more responsibility and more initiative in decision-making . the concert hall of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dso berlin has changed the dress code in its casual concerts series as concerts and musical bodies evolve , it seems only natural that concert venues follow suit .

if new venues were to be constructed , he added , they should be more adaptable than existing ones . " you have to approach it differently and discuss functionality again , and flexibility in the way musicians and the audience are arranged , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2009 desertification should not take a back seat to climate change debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worldwide desertification continues at a rapid pace the importance of fighting desertification is in danger of being overlooked by the attention given to climate change negotiations scheduled for the end of the year , science and technology expert steffen bauer writes . if we take a look beyond the current din of the campaigning here in germany , the term " copenhagen " seems to be everywhere .
the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .

the body was also critical of race relations in the czech republic and greece . switzerland is making progress but could do better when it comes to discrimination , according to a council report on the situation in the country .
the council of europe , through its european commission against racism and intolerance , or ecri , writes a report on each member every five years .
right wing party raises anxiety in the latest report , ecri said it is especially concerned about inflammatory political discourse in switzerland .
it warned against the tone of rhetoric used by the populist swiss people 's party , or svp .
party members had repeatedly attacked the basic rights of foreigners and breached the ban on racism and hate speech .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swiss anti-racism campaign confronted clichees in 2003 the " political discourse " of this national conservative party had " taken on a racist and anti-foreigner tone that could lead to racist generalizations against foreigners , muslims and other minorities , " the report said .
also , statements by the svp had led to " deep anxiety within swiss society and within minority groups . "
ecri also noted that unemployment among foreigners , who make up a fifth of the population , was in some places as much as three times that of natives .
however , the commission did praise some initiatives taken by the swiss government , such as integration offices in the country 's larger cities and an " extremism department " in the army .
czechs , greeks also critiqued the watchdog 's second report rapped the knuckles of the czech republic , pointing a finger at right-wing hate groups there that predominantly target roma .
crimes against roma included a murder in 2007 , the commission said .
globally , ecri stressed , hate-inspired acts of violence had dropped in recent years .
but " at the same time , there has been a disturbing intensification in the activities of the extreme right-wing milieu in the czech republic , including the setting up of a uniformed paramilitary group by one political party , " it said in a report .
finally , a study on greece concluded that that country also had made some progress , adopting a law against racial discrimination , and amending a law that makes racial motivation an aggravating circumstance when a crime is committed .
however , among other complaints , the committee also chastised the greeks for failing to ratify a protocol to the european convention on human rights that guarantees non-discrimination. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the calabrian mafia is thought to be behind the sinking . investigators believe the vessel could be one of more than 30 targeted by the ' ndrangheta , a mafia group based in the southern region of calabria .
a prosecutor from the town of paola said on tuesday that the find could turn out to be " only the first such wreck , " to provide evidence that the ' ndrangheta were involved in illicit waste disposal in the mediterranean .
the 110-meter vessel was found saturday around 500 meters below sea level and some 23 miles -lrb- 37 kilometers -rrb- off the coast of calabria .
investigators used a remote-controlled submersible to film the wreck .
the paolo prosecutor said the footage showed that the barrels had been sealed in a way that showed they could contain toxic materials .
the images also revealed that at least one barrel had fallen from the damaged hull and lay empty on the seabed .
investigators were tipped off to the wreck by a former ' ndrangheta member , francesco fonti , who in 2006 spoke of the sinking of a vessel in 1993 with explosives .
the location and size of the ship described by fonti corresponded to saturday 's find .
he had said that the vessel , the cunsky , was loaded with radioactive waste at the time .
authorities said they would carry out tests on the barrels to determine whether their contents were radioactive. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 15.09.2009 german opposition leaders upstage merkel and steinmeier in tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle , trittin and lafontaine -lrb- from left -rrb- faced off monday in a lively tv debate the leaders of germany 's opposition parties have underlined their determination to topple the grand coalition in the sept .
27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern munich roaring into champions league , wolfsburg and stuttgart limping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger and bayern are beginning to click as the champions league kicks off , last year 's runners-up from bavaria are surging .
meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .
german minister for consumer protection ilse aigner said tuesday that more compensation was needed for the victims of the lehman collapse .
" this does still not suffice , " she told radio station deutschlandradio kultur. dfm / afpd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision has angered bosnian muslim groups . plavsic , known as the " iron lady " , has served two-thirds of her sentence and will be eligible for parole in october under laws in sweden , where she is being detained .
in 2003 , she was convicted of the persecution of croats and bosnian muslims in the bosnian war , which raged from 1992 to 1995 .
plavsic had pleaded guilty to " inviting paramilitaries from serbia to assist bosnian serb forces in effecting ethnic separation by force " on political , racial and religious grounds .
the court had dropped charges of genocide , extermination and murder in return for her guilty plea .
the 79-year-old is the highest ranking official from the former yugoslavia to have acknowledged ordering atrocities perpetrated in the 1990 wars that sprang from the breakup of the yugoslav federation .
prior to the charges being dropped against her , plavsic had been one of three bosnian serb leaders , including radovan karadzic , due to face trial in october on multiple counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity , such as those committed in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-herzegovina in july 1995 .
outrage over release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian muslims gather every year to mourn srebrenica an estimated 8,000 muslim men and boys were massacred in srebrenica by members of the bosnian serb army under the command of ratko mladic , an indicted war criminal , as well as irregular serbian units .
muslim victims of the bosnian war were outraged tuesday by the decision taken by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to release plavsic .
" how can we explain this to children whose parents had been killed -lrb- in serb-run -rrb- camps -rrb- - children who remember their parents only from photos ? news agency afp quoted murat tahirovic , the head of an association of muslim and croat war camp prisoners , as asking .
munira subasic , the head of an association of survivors of the 1995 srebrenica massacre , said the only explanation for plavsic 's release was that " the world supports crime and criminals . "
" how is it possible that plavsic has the right to freedom and i do not have the right to find and bury the bones of my son 14 years after he was brutally killed ? " she asked. dfm / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 general election . ahead of the debate the opposition parties had expressed their irritation that they were not included in sunday 's televised duel between conservative chancellor angela merkel and her social democratic coalition partner , frank-walter steinmeier .
it was especially annoying , they said , since german public media is obliged to provide all parliamentary parties the same coverage ahead of elections .
as a result , the three opposition candidates , the liberal free democrats ' guido westerwelle , green party leader juergen trittin and the left party 's oskar lafontaine , were itching to sharpen their profiles - and outstrip the performances of steinmeier and merkel .
liberals against minimum and maximum wage westerwelle was quick to distance himself from his opposition rivals , reiterating his party 's staunch opposition to the introduction of a minimum wage .
he argued that such a scheme would eliminate rather than create new jobs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle 's tax and wage policy is only reconcilable with that of merkel 's cdu trittin and lafontaine pointed to other european countries that had introduced the minimum wage successfully .
they argued that politics had to intervene if some people in germany were being forced to work for less than 4 euros -lrb- $ 5.85 -rrb- per hour .
lafontaine called for a minimum of 10 euros per hour throughout germany .
westerwelle also argued against a mandatory limitation of executive salaries and bonus payments in private companies - a key left party demand .
" no tax cuts , " say greens and left the debate also highlighted marked differences in the opposition parties ' tax policies .
again trittin and lafontaine argued against westerwelle , calling for an increased top income tax rate to make those who earn higher salaries take on more of the burden .
both rejected future tax cuts in view of germany 's existing debts and ballooning budget deficit .
westerwelle in turn argued for tax cuts , saying that this was the right measure to create economic growth and new jobs .
all three politicians stressed their determination to do away with the mandatory retirement age of 67 , a benchmark introduced by the current government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin 's greens have most in common with the social democrats westerwelle and lafontaine wanted more flexibility regarding the retirement age , while trittin explained his party 's proposal of establishing a guaranteed pension scheme for everyone with a balance of thirty-three working years .
heading for a coalition stalemate ?
with regard to potential coalition talks after the sept .
27 election , trittin said he was in principle willing to negotiate with all parties .
however , the green leader underlined that his party was determined to prevent a coalition government between merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats , and that they were therefore unlikely to join one .
" we want to prevent a conservative-liberal government because that would , for example , mean no money for education , an attack on climate protection and the reintroduction of nuclear power , " said trittin .
westerwelle , who is hoping to become the new foreign minister in a conservative-led government , said he would rather remain in opposition than join up with a party that was not compatible with the free democrats .
" let me be frank : if i had wanted to govern in -lsb- with the social democrats and the greens -rsb- , then i would have done so by now , " said westerwelle , referring to the election stalemate of 2005 when he rebuffed an invitation by the social democrats to strike up such a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lafontaine 's left party is gaining influence but has no partners at the federal level lafontaine , who fell from grace with the social democrats after leaving the party in 2005 and later forming a left alliance , had little to say on the coalition issue .
he pointed out that all other parties had ruled out the option of joining up with the left party .
if merkel 's cdu / csu and the free democrats fail to garner enough votes , they will have to win over the greens to govern .
assuming that the social democrats continue to rule out cooperation with the left party on a federal level , they would likely need both the greens and the liberals to have any chance of governing .
otherwise , the current grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats , the country 's biggest parties , could spend another term in government together .
however , if the smaller parties continue winning away votes from those two - as seen in state elections this year - even the grand coalition might have to go in search of a third partner to secure a governing majority .

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .
german minister for consumer protection ilse aigner said tuesday that more compensation was needed for the victims of the lehman collapse .
" this does still not suffice , " she told radio station deutschlandradio kultur. dfm / afpd / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the body was also critical of race relations in the czech republic and greece . switzerland is making progress but could do better when it comes to discrimination , according to a council report on the situation in the country .
the council of europe , through its european commission against racism and intolerance , or ecri , writes a report on each member every five years .
right wing party raises anxiety in the latest report , ecri said it is especially concerned about inflammatory political discourse in switzerland .
it warned against the tone of rhetoric used by the populist swiss people 's party , or svp .
party members had repeatedly attacked the basic rights of foreigners and breached the ban on racism and hate speech .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swiss anti-racism campaign confronted clichees in 2003 the " political discourse " of this national conservative party had " taken on a racist and anti-foreigner tone that could lead to racist generalizations against foreigners , muslims and other minorities , " the report said .
also , statements by the svp had led to " deep anxiety within swiss society and within minority groups . "
ecri also noted that unemployment among foreigners , who make up a fifth of the population , was in some places as much as three times that of natives .
however , the commission did praise some initiatives taken by the swiss government , such as integration offices in the country 's larger cities and an " extremism department " in the army .
czechs , greeks also critiqued the watchdog 's second report rapped the knuckles of the czech republic , pointing a finger at right-wing hate groups there that predominantly target roma .
crimes against roma included a murder in 2007 , the commission said .
globally , ecri stressed , hate-inspired acts of violence had dropped in recent years .
but " at the same time , there has been a disturbing intensification in the activities of the extreme right-wing milieu in the czech republic , including the setting up of a uniformed paramilitary group by one political party , " it said in a report .
finally , a study on greece concluded that that country also had made some progress , adopting a law against racial discrimination , and amending a law that makes racial motivation an aggravating circumstance when a crime is committed .
however , among other complaints , the committee also chastised the greeks for failing to ratify a protocol to the european convention on human rights that guarantees non-discrimination. jen / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .

some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern munich roaring into champions league , wolfsburg and stuttgart limping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger and bayern are beginning to click as the champions league kicks off , last year 's runners-up from bavaria are surging .
meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2009 desertification should not take a back seat to climate change debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worldwide desertification continues at a rapid pace the importance of fighting desertification is in danger of being overlooked by the attention given to climate change negotiations scheduled for the end of the year , science and technology expert steffen bauer writes . if we take a look beyond the current din of the campaigning here in germany , the term " copenhagen " seems to be everywhere .
the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

the aftershocks of the collapse were felt worldwide .
although the economic crisis which followed is far from over , asia ’ s economies are showing signs of fast recovery , with china taking the lead . the economic crisis that followed the collapse of lehman brothers has been termed one of the worst since the great depression of the 1930s .
but while the united states continues to post poor consumer spending figures and depressing jobs data , the asian economies have already started looking up .
kyohei morita , the chief economist at barclays capital in tokyo , explained that “ the reason why asia could be the source of recovery for the global economy is because they were basically the beneficiaries of the global economic policies taken by the major economies especially .
the most notable example is the stimulus of the purchases of cars or autos or electrical appliances because asia can be regarded as the factory of these goods . ”
quick response to crisis ashok charan , a professor at national university of singapore , added that the asian governments , especially beijing , are recovering because they reacted very promptly .
especially , china which “ was very quick to respond to the crisis with a very large and substantial stimulus package by the government .
they were the first to show signs of bottoming out .
the developing world - china and india - are doing a bit better . ”
charan also thinks that increased domestic spending in the region has helped the asian economies recover faster than their western counterparts : “ the biggest potential for the government in particular was through triggering the domestic consumption because the chinese had amassed a huge sum in terms of savings .
the total savings in private and corporate in public china was to the tune of about 4.3 trillion us dollars which , compared to any other large economy , was really huge . traditionally , chinese have had the propensity to save . ”
emerging middle classes in china and india recently , the world bank lauded china for its measures that prevented the crisis from getting worse .
“ china as a whole continues to grow at 8 percent and india is expected to grow at 5.5 percent , ” charan explained .
“ over the years , in any case for the past 10 to 15 years , and this will go on for the future 10 to 20 years , both china and india have witnessed the emergence of the middle and upper middle class .
we asians are after all about 60 percent of the world ’ s population in terms of size and diversity and we are rapidly urbanising , ” he added .
kyohei morita of barclays capital in tokyo agreed : “ we still have at least 15 years of population growth without aging .
i would say that the savings ratio will not fall - at least over the coming 15 years . ”
“ it may take a few years before the us becomes as large a market as it was , ” warned charan .
“ so some realignment may take place and may go beyond asia , brazil and russia as well .
asia is not just china and india - there ’ s indonesia , which is clearly doing pretty very well at this moment and there ’ s vietnam , which is growing faster . ”
although the asian economies have shown signs of a speedy recovery from the crisis , experts warn that the consequences of the financial crisis will be long-lasting .

the aftershocks of the collapse were felt worldwide .
although the economic crisis which followed is far from over , asia ’ s economies are showing signs of fast recovery , with china taking the lead . the economic crisis that followed the collapse of lehman brothers has been termed one of the worst since the great depression of the 1930s .
but while the united states continues to post poor consumer spending figures and depressing jobs data , the asian economies have already started looking up .
kyohei morita , the chief economist at barclays capital in tokyo , explained that “ the reason why asia could be the source of recovery for the global economy is because they were basically the beneficiaries of the global economic policies taken by the major economies especially .
the most notable example is the stimulus of the purchases of cars or autos or electrical appliances because asia can be regarded as the factory of these goods . ”
quick response to crisis ashok charan , a professor at national university of singapore , added that the asian governments , especially beijing , are recovering because they reacted very promptly .
especially , china which “ was very quick to respond to the crisis with a very large and substantial stimulus package by the government .
they were the first to show signs of bottoming out .
the developing world - china and india - are doing a bit better . ”
charan also thinks that increased domestic spending in the region has helped the asian economies recover faster than their western counterparts : “ the biggest potential for the government in particular was through triggering the domestic consumption because the chinese had amassed a huge sum in terms of savings .
the total savings in private and corporate in public china was to the tune of about 4.3 trillion us dollars which , compared to any other large economy , was really huge . traditionally , chinese have had the propensity to save . ”
emerging middle classes in china and india recently , the world bank lauded china for its measures that prevented the crisis from getting worse .
“ china as a whole continues to grow at 8 percent and india is expected to grow at 5.5 percent , ” charan explained .
“ over the years , in any case for the past 10 to 15 years , and this will go on for the future 10 to 20 years , both china and india have witnessed the emergence of the middle and upper middle class .
we asians are after all about 60 percent of the world ’ s population in terms of size and diversity and we are rapidly urbanising , ” he added .
kyohei morita of barclays capital in tokyo agreed : “ we still have at least 15 years of population growth without aging .
i would say that the savings ratio will not fall - at least over the coming 15 years . ”
“ it may take a few years before the us becomes as large a market as it was , ” warned charan .
“ so some realignment may take place and may go beyond asia , brazil and russia as well .
asia is not just china and india - there ’ s indonesia , which is clearly doing pretty very well at this moment and there ’ s vietnam , which is growing faster . ”
although the asian economies have shown signs of a speedy recovery from the crisis , experts warn that the consequences of the financial crisis will be long-lasting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 15.09.2009 desertification should not take a back seat to climate change debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worldwide desertification continues at a rapid pace the importance of fighting desertification is in danger of being overlooked by the attention given to climate change negotiations scheduled for the end of the year , science and technology expert steffen bauer writes . if we take a look beyond the current din of the campaigning here in germany , the term " copenhagen " seems to be everywhere .
the un climate conference , set for early december in the danish capital and expected to come up with a new world climate agreement , has assumed something like pride of place in current political debates , and rightly so , too . meanwhile , another global policy process facing an important test is in danger of being completely overlooked here in germany : the united nations convention to combat desertification -lrb- unccd -rrb- , whose ninth conference of the parties is set to come together in buenos aires from sept .
21 to oct 2 .
it 's a somewhat strange state of affairs considering that the unccd has found its institutional home in the german " un town " of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secretariat of the unccd has been located in bonn since 1999 this lack of attention is symptomatic for the intricate history of the convention , which came into force in 1996 and is described , even by well-meaning critics , as modest in scope .
it was in unaccustomed unanimity at the last conference of parties in 2007 in madrid that industrialized and developing countries adopted an ambitious 10-year strategic plan , launching a set of far-reaching institutional reforms . additionally , un secretary-general ban ki-moon appointed a new executive secretary , luc gnacadja , a former environmental minister of benin who has brought a reputation as a firm , assertive , and efficient manager to the job .
in short , the prevailing spirit was one of optimism for the future . it takes 193 to tango it is now proving difficult to sustain that impetus in the run-up to the buenos aires meeting .
however , the upcoming conference of the 193 parties to the convention - all of the un member states plus the european community - is far more than just another test .
if not enough is done to follow up on the decisions taken in madrid , the momentum for reform may well dissipate , relegating the convention process to the background of development policy once and for all . that would not be in the interest of germany , the convention 's host country , and certainly not in the interests of the one third of the global population living in the world 's dryland regions -most of them in absolute poverty .
and it would effectively make a farce of the un decade for deserts and the fight against desertification -lrb- 2010-20 -rrb- , even before it had got underway . scientific expertise without political agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the world 's population lives in dry regions one reason for optimism that the conference may take a constructive course is seen in the meeting of the committee on science and technology -lrb- cst -rrb- , a subsidiary body of the conference of the parties .
in keeping with the decisions on reform adopted in madrid , the cst meeting will , for the first time , be organized in the form of an international expert conference .
germany had called for this , and the aim of the move is to prevent the cst from being misused - as it often has in the past - as a sideline arena for politicized procedural debates between developing and developed countries . instead , the idea is to set the stage for the representatives of the parties to engage in a focused exchange on substantive issues with eminent representatives of the scientific community , enabling them to reach agreement on a set of clear and verifiable indicators urgently needed for a result-based implementation of specific convention objectives .
if the conference succeeds in coming to viable decisions in this area , it would have achieved at least one paramount goal . anticipated budget problems among the other critical points on the agenda is , as always , the budget of the convention secretariat .
in the light of past years ' experiences and against the background of the current financial crisis , there is every reason to expect the donor countries to adopt a restrictive course here . the donors would , however , be well advised to understand clearly that it is essential to give the new leadership the scope of action it needs to bring about effective change , both in structural and in personnel terms , bearing on the future organization of the convention process .
the new , results-based management system adopted under executive-secretary gnacadja has proven useful in distinguishing between core and non-core tasks of the secretariat , creating a clear-cut basis for funding decisions . controversy over convention 's implementation in addition , controversial negotiations are expected on decentralizing the implementation of the convention .
while many developing countries favor regional offices of the unccd secretariat , developed countries fear this would in effect create a set of inefficient and , above all , costly parallel structures .
whether reasonable and workable compromises are reached on the undisputed need for improved policy coordination at the regional and sub-regional level is a matter that will largely depend on the negotiating skills of the parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffen bauer from the german development institute in all points set for discussion , germany and the european union are called upon to contribute their share to the success of the upcoming conference of the parties as well as to efforts to implement the 10-year strategic plan .
that would mean , first of all , to pay adequate political attention to the convention process .
sending no heads of state or government , or at least pertinent ministers , to buenos aires for the conference of the parties would be tantamount to signaling precisely the opposite .
it would , instead , serve to underline the already prevalent impression in the developing countries that the industrialized countries are at best indifferent to the goals of the unccd . if germany and europe are , in fact , interested in guiding a successful conference tango , they would be well advised to show both resolution and credibility vis-a-vis their partners from the developing world .
the diplomatic stage has been set , the roles assigned .
while the steps involved may be as intricate as those of an artful argentine tango , they are still sufficiently well known .
ultimately , it will hinge on whether or not the 193 partners are inclined to dance together - or prepared to stumble and fail , one and all . author : steffen bauer -lrb- ari -rrb- editor : sean sinico steffen bauer is a political scientist in the " environmental policy and management of natural resources " department of the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 15.09.2009 un says both israel and palestinian militants committed war crimes in the gaza conflict großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un report says there is clear evidence of war crimes in gaza a report published by the united nations says that both israel 's military as well as palestinian militants committed war crimes in the gaza war and may have also committed crimes against humanity . the over 500 page report , prepared by a four-member panel headed by the noted south african jurist richard goldstone , says there is evidence that both sides in the december 27 - january 18 hostilities were responsible for war crimes , but is particularly critical of what it calls israel 's " disproportionate use of force " .
" the mission concluded that actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly in some respects crimes against humanity , were committed by the israel defense force , " said u.n. investigator richard goldstone to reporters .
he called on the un to insist that both israel and the palestinians launch investigations to get to the bottom of the charges .
israel immediately responded to the statement and said that the report was one-sided and did not take into account the thousands of hamas militant missile attacks on its civilian population .
it had refused to cooperate with the investigation , saying that the un human rights council was biased against the jewish state .
" both the mandate of the mission and the resolution establishing it prejudged the outcome of any investigation , gave legitimacy to the hamas terrorist organization and disregarded the deliberate hamas strategy of using palestinian civilians as cover for launching terrorist attacks , " said a statement on the israeli foreign ministry web site .
the hostilities killed more than 1,400 palestinians and , according to human rights groups , at least 900 of them were civilians .
the israelis lost 10 soldiers and three civilians .
the report is based on nearly 200 interviews and more than 20,000 documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge richard goldstone rejects israeli criticism of his team 's findings goldstone said that , while the palestinians had not conducted any investigations into the clash at all , israel 's investigations were , in the words of the report , not credible .
he urged both sides to conduct formal investigations , and said that if neither side did , the security council should refer the matter to the international criminal court in the hague .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.09.2009 bayern munich roaring into champions league , wolfsburg and stuttgart limping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger and bayern are beginning to click as the champions league kicks off , last year 's runners-up from bavaria are surging .
meanwhile , germany 's defending champs and a new-look stuttgart 's league campaigns have begun to stutter . " this year will be harder than all the others if we want to win this competition , " said bayern munich president karl-heinz rummenigge on monday .
that might sound like caution , but this is bayern munich talking .
the tournament 's group stage has n't even started , and already rummenigge is talking about winning it all .
it 's been this way for years – bayern begin their champions league campaign with an eye on silverware , other german sides talk about making it out of their group .
some say the difference in expectation stems from arrogance , but this year it seems well-founded .
not because bayern are in such good form , but because stuttgart and wolfsburg are finding results hard to come by .
a dip in form or more ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wolves are on the back foot after three straight losses wolfsburg came into the season looking fluid in polishing off stuttgart and cologne , but they have lost their way in recent weeks , dropping three matches on the trot .
they can take a bit of confidence out of their last match against leverkusen , however , in which they fought back from 3-0 to lose by just one goal .
" it was very unfortunate we did n't beat leverkusen , " said brazilian striker grafite .
" we needed a confidence booster and we need to work hard to get out of this bad phase .
we have the quality to achieve that . "
the german champions ought to have enough quality to match up at home to last year 's russian league runners-up , cska moscow .
the club is in a state of flux at the moment , having fired their old coach , brazilian midfield legend zico , while sitting in third place .
management at the old red army club says , however , that they had to fire zico because the players did n't much like him , and because they had reached a deal with the man they had wanted for close to a year now : juande ramos , lately of real madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hleb may come good , but he has n't yet stranded on the launch pad stuttgart , meanwhile , have simply not gotten off the ground this season .
the team 's attack has - naturally - suffered in the wake of the sale of mario gomez to bayern , but the addition of aliaksandr hleb and pavel pogrebnyak ought to have helped plug that hole .
unfortunately for stuttgart , the offense has only really convinced in one league game thus far , a 4-2 dismantling of the game-but-naive freiburg .
defensively , though , the team looks fairly sharp .
they 've ground out draws with dortmund and nuremburg when nothing was going on up front , and were simply overpowered by a rampant hamburg on the weekend – a fate that has befallen many teams lately .
in that scottish sides are not well-known for their offensive game plans -lrb- or good results -rrb- away from home , stuttgart 's energetic defense should be enough to get them a win against rangers on wednesday .
firing on all cylinders after a shaky start to the season , bayern suddenly look steady , and potent in attack .
arjen robben appers to have been a great buy , franck ribery has turned off the stream of unsettled quotes and turned on the scoring , and the team is getting standout performances from less expected quarters too .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quite the double act last week , bastian schweinsteiger 's form crisis was a lead topic in the german press .
this onetime of the golden boy of the 2006 world cup , a player most had expected to rise into the international elite , had instead stalled at the solid-but-unspectacular level .
but on saturday in dortmund , it was schweinsteiger 's time to answer his critics .
his goal , which took bayern up 2-1 , changed the match and led to the eventual 5-1 result .
moreover , 20-year-old thomas mueller appears as if he may make the breakthrough for bayern .
despite the club 's good youth system and free spending on players young as well as old , bayern has a reputation for squelching the dreams of youngsters hoping to make the leap to becoming regulars in the senior side .
in recent years alone , bayern has sent packing , perhaps too soon , the likes of piotr trochowski , zvejdan misimovic , toni kroos and mats hummels – who , now at dortmund , scored against bayern on saturday .
that their new manager , louis van gaal , is being patient with mueller – and that mueller is repaying him with goals – can only be a good sign for the club .
it 's also a relief that bayern is starting their champions league campaign away to one of the weakest sides in the field .
barring a big surprise , israeli league leaders maccabi haifa are there to make up the numbers .
their coach , elisha levy , has tried to put a brave face on tuesday night 's encounter , saying his team " is n't going to hide from anyone . "
that may mean a few minutes less before bayern start scoring .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.09.2009 european proposals to beat financial crisis meet with criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of lehman brothers set off a chain reaction a year ago , the collapse of lehman brothers sparked the global financial crisis .
european politicians vowed to take action to better regulate the markets , but now insiders are warning against a knee-jerk reaction . since the crisis dawned , policymakers in europe have been keen to reassure voters that they are taking action to prevent another such crisis from happening again .
this has led to a flurry of new policies and policy adjustments to minimize risk and ensure that an atmosphere of sobriety prevails in the financial sector .
but with pressure mounting to implement many changes before the end of the year , critics are now becoming more vocal .
hastily-made changes , they warn , could end up further damaging markets ; reasonable responses , not knee-jerk reactions are what the sector needs .
controversial law one controversial development is the european commission 's proposed alternative investment fund managers directive .
it aims to increase supervisory scrutiny on managers of hedge funds and private equity funds .
but sharon bowles , who chairs the european parliament 's economic and monetary affairs committee , has warned that the proposed legislation might prompt investors to move their money outside the eu .
" every time you add an expense -lrb- through regulation -rrb- , you are dropping the yield for the european investor , " she told the european voice .
she criticized the " one size fits all " approach taken by the commission in the aifm draft legislation .
" i think you have to take into account the nature of the type of fund , " she said .
sweden has now called for a discussion over a number of key issues in the aifm directive , in the hope of resolving some of the bigger problems with the draft while it holds the eu 's six-monthly rotating presidency .
sweden suggested , for example , that the proposed minimum threshold for portfolio values could be deleted .
additionally , it said that an alternative investment fund needed to be clearly defined so as to clarify the scope of the directive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display a banner in the heart of london 's financial district " given the global character of the activities of many market players , the current draft does not seem workable as it in many cases will not be possible to hold the assets in the eu without incurring considerable costs for investors , " sweden said in its note on the directive .
the european asset management industry 's central lobbying group has also warned that key changes are still needed to the directive , saying politicians otherwise risk ratifying legislation that increases the potential for systemic risk .
peter de proft , director general of the european fund and asset managers association -lrb- efama -rrb- argued specifically that requiring funds to hold assets in depositories could increase systemic risk because only a handful of firms would be able to provide the service .
" depository regulations for institutional investors change the burden of responsibility , limiting the depository function to europe without the possibility of outsourcing , " he said .
" we are limiting the number of institutions who are able to fulfill the role , which is contrary to the principles of risk and increases risk because -lrb- the depositories -rrb- would hold all of the assets . "
curbs on pay and bonuses another policy area which is now sparking the anger of european bankers tired of being the scapegoats of the crisis is proposed curbs on salaries and bonuses within the sector .
in april , the european commission responded to public anger about perceived managerial greed in the midst of the recession by unveiling several proposals to cut back on excessive remuneration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlie mccreevy " up to now , there have been far too many perverse incentives in place in the financial services industry , " said eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy .
" it is neither sensible nor sane that pay incentives encourage excessive risk-taking for short-term gain . "
mccreevy said that managers ' salaries should reflect " sound and effective risk management , " while the payment of bonuses should be linked to the long-term performance of the company .
in addition , a company 's remuneration policies need to be " adequately disclosed to stakeholders " and properly supervised .
finally , banks should be permitted to " claw back " bonuses paid if there is evidence of wrongdoing .
german chancellor angela merkel said she wants leaders at the upcoming g-20 summit in pittsburgh to agree on measures that would limit the high bonuses paid to bank executives . g-20 finance ministers meeting in london ahead of the sept .
24-25 summit agreed on steps to limit bankers ' bonuses but declined to back french and german proposals for a mandatory cap .
instead , they proposed that bonuses be deferred for up to five years to allow time to assess bankers ' actions over the longer term .
but european bankers are starting to fight back .
some banking professionals claim they 've already cleaned up much of the excess voluntarily ; others , like ubs chairman kaspar villiger , say that the crackdown on bonuses is a populist measure being used by politicians to deflect blame away from themselves . " many banks have made inexcusable mistakes , however these mistakes are not the cause of the crisis , " villiger told reuters .
" the markets have not failed , they have reacted logically to the misguided incentives set by politicians , in particular -lrb- in -rrb- the us . "
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said there was now a tendency to over-regulate financial markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann is one of the bankers who 's fighting back " the financial markets do not need more regulation , they need better regulation , " he said .
at a recent banking conference in frankfurt , urs rohner , ceo at credit suisse , warned against rules that would hamper the sector 's ability to attract the best talent , or that would put european banks at a disadvantage against banks in other financial centers . and josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank , was quoted by reuters as saying : " the war for talent is in full swing .
the question of whether we have learned something focuses too much on the question of bonuses and leaves out other aspects . "

they are calling for compensation for the money they lost as a result . demonstrations in germany 's financial capital frankfurt began at the city 's district court and moved to lehman brothers ' former german headquarters .
protestors ' chants were directed towards banks and lenders who they said had given them poor financial advice , including encouraging them to invest in the doomed us lender , which crashed sept .
15 , 2008 .
it is estimated that around 40,000 german small investors , many of them senior citizens and retirees , lost money when lehman went under .
" we were promised things that were not true , " said investor brigitte dreger at the frankfurt protest .
dreger and her husband erich said they lost 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 14,600 -rrb- due to the collapse of the us lender .
the couple said they had been advised by the savings bank frankfurter sparkasse in march last year that any investment in lehman brothers would guarantee a sure return .
the dregers said that within only six months a significant portion of the money from their retirement fund was gone .
calls for tighter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt called for their money back a spokesperson for the organizers of the demonstration , peter kyritz , said the small investors were calling for stricter rules for investment consultants , adding that , after the global financial crisis , the advice of banks could not be taken seriously .
some critics accuse financial consultants at german banks of advising in favor of lehman securities because of the promise of larger commissions .
demonstrations were also held in berlin and hamburg , where marchers carried their worthless lehman brothers investment certificates along with a coffin in a mock funeral procession .
in berlin , many elderly former lehman customers have been demonstrating weekly in front of city banks .
under the motto " we 've had enough , we want our money back , " the group has even initiated a small theatre group to draw attention to their plight .
life savings gone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors and retirees were hardest hit by the collapse annke corte and her husband , both in their 70s , said that after 35 years of working abroad they were persuaded by major international lender citibank to invest 83,000 euros of their combined savings in lehman certificates .
with the collapse of the bank the cortes lost their life savings .
" we are protesting because we want our money back .
you know the banks do n't do anything voluntarily , " she said at the berlin rally .
" under german law we have to prove that the banks failed in the truth of what they promised us .
they told us it was a secure investment .
i worked until 67 plus and thought i would have a nice retirement in my old home town berlin .
then everything went totally upside down , " she told deutsche welle .
german minister for consumer protection ilse aigner said tuesday that more compensation was needed for the victims of the lehman collapse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.09.2009 eu foreign ministers stress the need for a legitimate government in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier says the afghan vote must be legitimate european union foreign ministers have discussed a number of issues including the recent afghan elections and forming closer ties with nations in the southern caucasus region . high on the agenda at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on tuesday september 15 , was last month 's presidential election in afghanistan . the foreign ministers are faced with increasing public skepticism within the bloc about eu involvement in afghanistan and , thus , a credible outcome to the election is seen as crucial for future support .
" we can not ignore allegations of fraud and we will insist among the european foreign ministers that these will be scrutinized .
it is crucial that the newly elected president has the respect of the whole afghan population , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
currently , incumbent president hamid karzai is ahead in the vote count and he may have enough of a lead to avoid a runoff .
however , the un-backed election complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- has postponed plans to publish its findings in order to investigate the more than 2000 allegations of electoral fraud .
adding to the concerns , the eu 's own election observer mission in afghanistan said on september 8 that it had evidence of " large-scale ballot stuffing " which amounted to " hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes . " the eec has ordered a partial recount of approximately 10 percent of the polling stations in the country . depending on the outcome , a second-round run-off between karzai and his main challenger abdullah abdullah could become necessary .
all eu foreign ministers believe it is crucial for the next elected government in afghanistan to appear legitimate .
" the desirable thing would be to have the least bad , least corrupt , most credible government possible , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner . even if the elections are proved to be badly flawed , the eu can not abandon the government in kabul and the process of reconstruction which is costing both money and lives .
and even as the taliban insurgency shows no sign of letting up , the eu ministers know that their options are limited and that walking away now is not an option .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt said as much to reporters as he tried to paint a positive picture .
" we 're engaged in a long-term effort to build some kind of stability in the country .
it 's not going to be easy , it 's not going to be fast , it 's not going to be cheap , but i think it 's essential , " said bildt , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
closer ties sought with southern caucasus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt is not worried about russia the southern caucasus states of armenia , azerbaijan and georgia have all indicated that they want better relations with the eu . at tuesday 's meeting in brussels , the eu foreign ministers authorized the eu executive to begin working on the details of talks with these states , a move which is sure to provoke the russians .
ever since the dissolution of the soviet union , russia has seen the caucasus as falling within its " sphere of influence . "
however sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt , speaking at a press conference , does not see it that way .
" they have the right to choose their own destiny , they have expressed the views for a close relationship with the european union .
they have the right to choose their own future , not to be restricted by anyone , " said bildt .
relations with countries in the region and russia have been problematic and a brief five day war that russia and georgia fought last year did nothing to improve the atmosphere .
the eu 's negotiations will be about setting up agreements under which the southern caucasus states will promise to work toward reforms in the areas of human rights , politics , economics and trade , in return for assistance from the eu in such areas as tariff-free access to eu markets , and technical and financial assistance .
central america also on eu agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says honduras government must return zelaya to power the continuing political crisis in honduras also prompted the foreign ministers to issue a statement insisting that a solution be found to the situation that saw president manuel zelaya ousted from office in a coup .
" until a peaceful settlement is found , the eu will stand ready to take further restrictive measures including targeting those members of the de facto government who are seen to be blocking progress on a negotiated solution , " said the ministers in a statement released on tuesday .
speaking on behalf of the european union , the ministers also expressed their support for the mediation efforts of costa rican president oscar arias and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- and urged all parties to work toward a peaceful resolution .
in geneva , the united nations also made its voice heard when it barred j. delmer urbizo , the honduran envoy from attending the meetings of the un human rights council .
the 47-member council was informed by the council 's belgian president alex van neeuwen that urbizo would not be permitted to attend .
" i received a letter yesterday afternoon , dated august the 20th , indicating that the permanent representative of honduras in geneva is not the accredited representative of president zelaya 's government , " said van meeuwen .
honduras does not have a voting seat on the human rights council but wanted to observe the proceedings as many nations do .
in brussels the eu foreign ministers said that the 27 eu member states would continue to keep contacts with the government of honduras to a minimum .
the ministers also expressed concern about reported abuses of human rights such as detentions , deportations and a clamp down on peaceful demonstrations .
" the resolution is important because it means a zero tolerance towards the coup in honduras and against the authorities that participated in this coup or against the people that are now an obstacle to coming back to normality , " said diego lopez garrido , spain 's junior minister for eu affairs. av / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

advertisement former addict sarah : " i no longer use street heroin " a scheme in which heroin is given to addicts in supervised clinics has led to big reductions in the use of street drugs and crime , the bbc has learned .
more than 100 users took part in the pilot - part funded by the government - in london , brighton and darlington .
they either injected heroin or received the drug 's substitute methadone .
those given heroin responded best and an independent panel which monitored the scheme over six months is advising ministers to set up further trials .
about three-quarters of those given heroin were said to have " substantially " reduced their use of street drugs .
research suggests that between half and two-thirds of all crime in the uk is drug-related .
the home office says on its website that about three-quarters of crack and heroin users claim they commit crime to feed their habits .
pilot scheme findings three-quarters reduced use of street heroin offences down from 1,731 in 30 days to 547 in six months spending on drugs down from £ 300 to £ 50 a week figures for group given heroin professor john strang , who led the project , said the results were " very positive " because the scheme had helped cut crime and avoid " expensive " prison sentences .
professor strang , who is based at the national addiction centre , part of king 's health partners , said the individuals on the programme were among those who had been the hardest to treat .
" it 's as if each of them is an oil tanker heading for disaster and so the purpose of this trial is to see : ' can you turn them around ?
is it possible to avert disaster ? '
" and the surprising finding - which is good for the individuals and good for society as well - is that you can , " he said .
the randomised injecting opioid treatment trial -lrb- riott -rrb- programme - which is funded by a number of agencies , including the department of health - began in 2005 .
from the today programme please turn on javascript .

more from today programme it involved 127 chronic heroin addicts for whom conventional types of treatment had failed .
many of the addicts were also using other substances , including crack cocaine .
during the trials , a third of addicts were given the heroin substitute methadone orally and another third injected methadone under supervision .
the remainder , observed by nurses , injected themselves with diamorphine - unadulterated heroin - imported from switzerland .
national roll-out ?
those on the programme were also given psychological support and help with their housing and social needs .
the results showed that addicts in all three groups cut the amount of heroin they obtained illicitly from street dealers .
according to researchers , more than half of the heroin injecting group were said to be " largely abstinent " and one-in-five did not use street heroin at all .
before they began the programme , the addicts in the heroin injecting group were spending more than £ 300 a week on street drugs .
after six months , this had reduced to an average of £ 50 a week .
it used to be about chasing the buzz , but when you go on the programme you just want to feel comfortable john , riott participant there was also a big drop in the number of offences addicts admitted committing to obtain money to feed their habit .
in the previous month before the scheme started , addicts in the heroin injecting group reported carrying out 1,731 crimes .
after six months , this had fallen to 547 offences - a reduction of more than two-thirds .
one of the heroin addicts on the programme , a 34-year-old man called john , had been addicted for eight years when the trials began .
he fed his habit by dealing .
" my life was just a shambles ... waking up , chasing money , chasing drugs , " he said .
but john said the scheme had transformed his life " 100 per cent " and he now had a part-time job .
" it used to be about chasing the buzz , but when you go on the programme you just want to feel comfortable , " he said .
many participants " substantially " reduced their use of street drugs " i 've started reducing my dose gradually , so that maybe in a few months time i 'll be able to come off it altogether , drug free totally . "
in its drug strategy , published last year , the government said it would " roll out " the prescription of injectible heroin , subject to the findings of the pilot scheme .
the national treatment agency for substance misuse -lrb- nta -rrb- , which administers drug treatment in england , said the results were " encouraging " .
the nta said an independent expert group , set up to advise the government , had concluded that there was enough " positive evidence of the benefits " of the programme to merit further pilots .
the nta is understood to be keen to evaluate the financial implications of the scheme .
at £ 15,000 per user per year , supervised heroin injecting is three times more expensive than other treatments .

advertisement former addict sarah : " i no longer use street heroin " a scheme in which heroin is given to addicts in supervised clinics has led to big reductions in the use of street drugs and crime , the bbc has learned .
more than 100 users took part in the pilot - part funded by the government - in london , brighton and darlington .
they either injected heroin or received the drug 's substitute methadone .
those given heroin responded best and an independent panel which monitored the scheme over six months is advising ministers to set up further trials .
about three-quarters of those given heroin were said to have " substantially " reduced their use of street drugs .
research suggests that between half and two-thirds of all crime in the uk is drug-related .
the home office says on its website that about three-quarters of crack and heroin users claim they commit crime to feed their habits .
pilot scheme findings three-quarters reduced use of street heroin offences down from 1,731 in 30 days to 547 in six months spending on drugs down from £ 300 to £ 50 a week figures for group given heroin professor john strang , who led the project , said the results were " very positive " because the scheme had helped cut crime and avoid " expensive " prison sentences .
professor strang , who is based at the national addiction centre , part of king 's health partners , said the individuals on the programme were among those who had been the hardest to treat .
" it 's as if each of them is an oil tanker heading for disaster and so the purpose of this trial is to see : ' can you turn them around ?
is it possible to avert disaster ? '
" and the surprising finding - which is good for the individuals and good for society as well - is that you can , " he said .
the randomised injecting opioid treatment trial -lrb- riott -rrb- programme - which is funded by a number of agencies , including the department of health - began in 2005 .

many of the addicts were also using other substances , including crack cocaine .
during the trials , a third of addicts were given the heroin substitute methadone orally and another third injected methadone under supervision .
the remainder , observed by nurses , injected themselves with diamorphine - unadulterated heroin - imported from switzerland .
national roll-out ?
those on the programme were also given psychological support and help with their housing and social needs .
the results showed that addicts in all three groups cut the amount of heroin they obtained illicitly from street dealers .
according to researchers , more than half of the heroin injecting group were said to be " largely abstinent " and one-in-five did not use street heroin at all .
before they began the programme , the addicts in the heroin injecting group were spending more than £ 300 a week on street drugs .
after six months , this had reduced to an average of £ 50 a week .
it used to be about chasing the buzz , but when you go on the programme you just want to feel comfortable john , riott participant there was also a big drop in the number of offences addicts admitted committing to obtain money to feed their habit .
in the previous month before the scheme started , addicts in the heroin injecting group reported carrying out 1,731 crimes .
after six months , this had fallen to 547 offences - a reduction of more than two-thirds .
one of the heroin addicts on the programme , a 34-year-old man called john , had been addicted for eight years when the trials began .
he fed his habit by dealing .
" my life was just a shambles ... waking up , chasing money , chasing drugs , " he said .

in its drug strategy , published last year , the government said it would " roll out " the prescription of injectible heroin , subject to the findings of the pilot scheme .
the national treatment agency for substance misuse -lrb- nta -rrb- , which administers drug treatment in england , said the results were " encouraging " .
the nta said an independent expert group , set up to advise the government , had concluded that there was enough " positive evidence of the benefits " of the programme to merit further pilots .
the nta is understood to be keen to evaluate the financial implications of the scheme .

advertisement former addict sarah : " i no longer use street heroin " a scheme in which heroin is given to addicts in supervised clinics has led to big reductions in the use of street drugs and crime , the bbc has learned .
more than 100 users took part in the pilot - part funded by the government - in london , brighton and darlington .
they either injected heroin or received the drug 's substitute methadone .
those given heroin responded best and an independent panel which monitored the scheme over six months is advising ministers to set up further trials .
about three-quarters of those given heroin were said to have " substantially " reduced their use of street drugs .
research suggests that between half and two-thirds of all crime in the uk is drug-related .
the home office says on its website that about three-quarters of crack and heroin users claim they commit crime to feed their habits .
pilot scheme findings three-quarters reduced use of street heroin offences down from 1,731 in 30 days to 547 in six months spending on drugs down from £ 300 to £ 50 a week figures for group given heroin professor john strang , who led the project , said the results were " very positive " because the scheme had helped cut crime and avoid " expensive " prison sentences .
professor strang , who is based at the national addiction centre , part of king 's health partners , said the individuals on the programme were among those who had been the hardest to treat .
" it 's as if each of them is an oil tanker heading for disaster and so the purpose of this trial is to see : ' can you turn them around ?
is it possible to avert disaster ? '
" and the surprising finding - which is good for the individuals and good for society as well - is that you can , " he said .
the randomised injecting opioid treatment trial -lrb- riott -rrb- programme - which is funded by a number of agencies , including the department of health - began in 2005 .

more from today programme it involved 127 chronic heroin addicts for whom conventional types of treatment had failed .
many of the addicts were also using other substances , including crack cocaine .
during the trials , a third of addicts were given the heroin substitute methadone orally and another third injected methadone under supervision .
the remainder , observed by nurses , injected themselves with diamorphine - unadulterated heroin - imported from switzerland .
national roll-out ?
those on the programme were also given psychological support and help with their housing and social needs .
the results showed that addicts in all three groups cut the amount of heroin they obtained illicitly from street dealers .
according to researchers , more than half of the heroin injecting group were said to be " largely abstinent " and one-in-five did not use street heroin at all .
before they began the programme , the addicts in the heroin injecting group were spending more than £ 300 a week on street drugs .
after six months , this had reduced to an average of £ 50 a week .
it used to be about chasing the buzz , but when you go on the programme you just want to feel comfortable john , riott participant there was also a big drop in the number of offences addicts admitted committing to obtain money to feed their habit .
in the previous month before the scheme started , addicts in the heroin injecting group reported carrying out 1,731 crimes .
after six months , this had fallen to 547 offences - a reduction of more than two-thirds .
one of the heroin addicts on the programme , a 34-year-old man called john , had been addicted for eight years when the trials began .
he fed his habit by dealing .
" my life was just a shambles ... waking up , chasing money , chasing drugs , " he said .
but john said the scheme had transformed his life " 100 per cent " and he now had a part-time job .
" it used to be about chasing the buzz , but when you go on the programme you just want to feel comfortable , " he said .
many participants " substantially " reduced their use of street drugs " i 've started reducing my dose gradually , so that maybe in a few months time i 'll be able to come off it altogether , drug free totally . "
in its drug strategy , published last year , the government said it would " roll out " the prescription of injectible heroin , subject to the findings of the pilot scheme .
the national treatment agency for substance misuse -lrb- nta -rrb- , which administers drug treatment in england , said the results were " encouraging " .
the nta said an independent expert group , set up to advise the government , had concluded that there was enough " positive evidence of the benefits " of the programme to merit further pilots .
the nta is understood to be keen to evaluate the financial implications of the scheme .
at £ 15,000 per user per year , supervised heroin injecting is three times more expensive than other treatments .
