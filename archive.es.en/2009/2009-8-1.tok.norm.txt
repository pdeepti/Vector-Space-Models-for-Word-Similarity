the americans were killed in roadside bomb blasts in kandahar province and the french soldier was killed in a gun battle north of the capital , kabul .
the latest deaths in afghanistan come after comments by the new head of nato and former danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen that he would be willing to talk with moderate sections of the taliban to try and win the war there .
barely hours after taking over the reins at nato on aug 1 , rasmussen told the danish newspaper politiken that he favors setting up negotiations with the radical islamist taliban in afghanistan .
however , he emphasized that such a dialogue was only possible with certain sections of the taliban .
" there is certainly a hard core that is impossible to reach any deals with .
they have only respect for military powers , " he told the newspaper , " i certainly do n't know why one should strike any agreements with those who are killing our soldiers .

the renewed tensions come just one week ahead of the first anniversary of the war . georgia on saturday denied firing mortars at the breakaway republic of south ossetia .
south ossetia claimed two mortar rounds were fired at a military observation post from the village of ditsi on the georgian side of the de facto border . also on saturday , moscow warned georgia that its military reserved the right to use force if necessary if the former soviet state continues " provocations " in the caucasas .
georgia , russia trade accusations both sides have accused the other of shelling earlier this week in tskhinvali , the capital of the south ossetian breakaway region , which is recognized as independent by russia .
georgian interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili , speaking to afp in tbilisi , denied any shooting had taken place .
but the russian defense ministry described the alleged georgian actions as an " attempt by the georgian leadership to inflame the situation in the region . "
utiashvili described the statement as " very worrisome " , saying russia " may be searching for a pretext " for military action against georgia .
" we hope the international community will condemn these clearly aggressive actions from the russians , " he said .
the latest tensions between georgia and russia come a week ahead of the august 7 anniversary of the five-day war between the two countries over south ossetia .
a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia was rebuffed by russia .
moscow then sent troops and tanks deep into georgian territory .
rebel leader calls for unification with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetian president eduard kokoity would like the region to become part of russia in an interview with the reuters news agency the leader of the rebel enclave of south ossetia said he wanted to unite his people with russia and called on the kremlin to deploy more troops and weapons .
" my goal in life , my political goal , is to unite my people , " the self-styled president , eduard kokoity , said during the interview .
" we will build our own state , which will be in alliance with russia , together with russia and i am not excluding that one day , we will be part of russia , " he said .
" the people of south ossetia want to be united with russia . "
south ossetians , who are ethnically distinct from georgians , speak their own farsi-related language and say they have been separated from their fellow people in the neighboring region of north ossetia in russia .
ninety eight percent of south ossetia 's population hold russian passports .
russian is the lingua franca and the russian ruble is the currency used .
kokoity said russia was not yet ready for unification " because this involves a very serious accusation of annexing territory . "

the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .

price and pay disputes between russia and ukraine have led to serious disruptions to the natural gas supply in recent years across the european union , which relies on russia for around a quarter of its gas consumption .

the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .

critics have slammed the move as state censorship . diosdado cabello , the head of national telecommunications regulator conatel and minister of public works in president hugo chavez 's leftist government , said the decision to close the stations was part of " a new phase of information . "
cabello said the closures were due to the stations ' failures to meet legal operating requirements , and warned that more closures may follow .
he defended the closures , saying they were part of the government 's effort to " democratize the airwaves . "
but critics said the crackdown was arbitrary and the owners were not given the right to a proper defense .
the venezuelan chamber of radio broadcasters described the decision as an " enormous violation . "
freedom of expression the decision to shut down the 34 stations came one day after luisa ortega diaz , venezuela 's top prosecutor , suggested toughening the country 's media law to " regulate the freedom of expression . " it is not the first time chavez has recalled the licences of broadcasters considered critical of the government . opposition broadcaster globovision , which the president accused of " media terrorism , " has often been threatened with having its license revoked .
the broadcaster has also been slapped with hefty fines . in 2007 , chavez did not renew the license for a widely watched private tv station , rctv , that was a persistent critic of the government .
analysts believe the move is part of chavez 's payback to the media owners , who he has never forgiven for backing a failed coup against him in 2002 .
in total , 240 radio stations are under investigation , representing 40 per cent of the nation 's broadcasters . td / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have slammed the move as state censorship . diosdado cabello , the head of national telecommunications regulator conatel and minister of public works in president hugo chavez 's leftist government , said the decision to close the stations was part of " a new phase of information . "
cabello said the closures were due to the stations ' failures to meet legal operating requirements , and warned that more closures may follow .
he defended the closures , saying they were part of the government 's effort to " democratize the airwaves . "
but critics said the crackdown was arbitrary and the owners were not given the right to a proper defense .
the venezuelan chamber of radio broadcasters described the decision as an " enormous violation . "
freedom of expression the decision to shut down the 34 stations came one day after luisa ortega diaz , venezuela 's top prosecutor , suggested toughening the country 's media law to " regulate the freedom of expression . " it is not the first time chavez has recalled the licences of broadcasters considered critical of the government . opposition broadcaster globovision , which the president accused of " media terrorism , " has often been threatened with having its license revoked .
the broadcaster has also been slapped with hefty fines . in 2007 , chavez did not renew the license for a widely watched private tv station , rctv , that was a persistent critic of the government .
analysts believe the move is part of chavez 's payback to the media owners , who he has never forgiven for backing a failed coup against him in 2002 .
in total , 240 radio stations are under investigation , representing 40 per cent of the nation 's broadcasters . td / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2009 loan deal agreed for ukraine gas bills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dispute between moscow and kiev hit homes and businesses in europe in january the european commission says ukraine has reached a deal with international financial bodies and the eu for payment of russian gas bills .
the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .
" i 'm extremely pleased that political agreement has been reached with ukraine on reform of its gas sector , which opens the way for a financial assistance package to be provided by the international financial institutions to ukraine , " said commission chief jose manuel barroso .
“ the agreement should also provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia , ” he said , adding that that would provide “ the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect . "
price and pay disputes between russia and ukraine have led to serious disruptions to the natural gas supply in recent years across the european union , which relies on russia for around a quarter of its gas consumption .
a payment dispute between moscow and kiev halted european gas deliveries in january , cutting off heating to thousands of homes during a cold snap .
naftogaz says ukraine has to pay a gas bill of around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- on august 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past , russia has accused ukraine of stealing gas from pipelines leading to europe politics or commerce ?
the eu has sought more transparent and commercial terms for how gas is traded between russia and ukraine .
both russia 's gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz are owned by their governments , leading to charges that the trade is more about politics than commerce .
a european commission spokesman said the deal agreed to on friday also allows for an influx of funding totaling 570 million euros from the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- in october .
one of the conditions for the loans is a recapitalization of naftogaz to the tune of two billion dollars , according to the eu commission .
a statement on the ebrd website made it clear that its funding was conditional on ukraine modernizing its energy sector , in particular naftogaz .
" our aim is to improve the sustainability , accountability and above all , the transparency of the ukrainian gas market to the benefit of both ukraine and of energy security in all of europe , " said ebrd president thomas mirow .
an imf official said ukraine would also have to increase its domestic gas prices to bring them into line with international prices. rb / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two women in portugal attempted to marry in 2006 .
after being refused a license by a lisbon registry office , they sued . in a divided ruling against teresa pires and helena paixao , the high court said in a statement that it had reviewed a successful appeal by the two women that reversed an earlier court ruling denying them the right to wed , and reinstated the lower court 's verdict by three votes to two .
the portuguese constitution forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation . the women had been trying since 2006 to overturn the decision using that article .
the two women were turned away by a lisbon registry office because the law stipulates that marriage is between people of different sexes .
the constitutional court said in a statement on july 31 that the constitution does not state that same-sex marriages must be permitted .
on july 29 , prime minister jose socrates and his socialist party presented its manifesto for the sept .
27 general election .
allowing people of the same sex to wed in the predominantly roman catholic country was among the proposals .

utiashvili described the statement as " very worrisome " , saying russia " may be searching for a pretext " for military action against georgia .

the latest tensions between georgia and russia come a week ahead of the august 7 anniversary of the five-day war between the two countries over south ossetia .
a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia was rebuffed by russia .
moscow then sent troops and tanks deep into georgian territory .

" we will build our own state , which will be in alliance with russia , together with russia and i am not excluding that one day , we will be part of russia , " he said .

south ossetians , who are ethnically distinct from georgians , speak their own farsi-related language and say they have been separated from their fellow people in the neighboring region of north ossetia in russia .
ninety eight percent of south ossetia 's population hold russian passports .
russian is the lingua franca and the russian ruble is the currency used .
kokoity said russia was not yet ready for unification " because this involves a very serious accusation of annexing territory . "

his comments come amid reports that western soldiers were killed by insurgents in afghanistan on saturday . officials say three us troops and one french soldier were killed in separate attacks in afghanistan on saturday .
the americans were killed in roadside bomb blasts in kandahar province and the french soldier was killed in a gun battle north of the capital , kabul .
the latest deaths in afghanistan come after comments by the new head of nato and former danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen that he would be willing to talk with moderate sections of the taliban to try and win the war there .
barely hours after taking over the reins at nato on aug 1 , rasmussen told the danish newspaper politiken that he favors setting up negotiations with the radical islamist taliban in afghanistan .
however , he emphasized that such a dialogue was only possible with certain sections of the taliban .
" there is certainly a hard core that is impossible to reach any deals with .
they have only respect for military powers , " he told the newspaper , " i certainly do n't know why one should strike any agreements with those who are killing our soldiers . " but he said he would support dialogue with " moderate groups on the outer reaches of the taliban . " and added , " we obviously want to co-operate with those who want to contribute to a safer situation in afghanistan and to create a framework for reconstruction and economic and social development . " rising casualties and low morale the conflict in afghanistan is the largest military campaign in nato 's history .
it 's also the bloodiest , with over 1,000 western troops killed since the alliance began operations in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are doubting the afghan mission as casulties add up there are around 90,000 international troops under the nato military alliance and us-led coalition command in afghanistan , fighting alongside afghan forces against the taliban and other radical groups . but the insurgency against the western-backed afghan government has steadily worsened despite a growing international presence . rasmussen will have to try to persuade reluctant european allies to commit more troops , money and other resources to afghanistan at a time when opinion polls show public support for the war waning as casualties grow . many nato members have begun to lose faith in the mission , and one by one they have begun making plans to pull out their troops . the dutch are expected to recall their soldiers from afghanistan next year , and canada is debating a 2011 pull-out .
meanwhile , great britain 's role in the conflict has come under fire at home after 22 soldiers were killed during fighting last month alone. mrm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the trial on saturday was a show and the confessions are invalid ...
what was called a trial was a violation of the constitution , " the site said .
" such show trials will directly harm the system and will further damage public trust . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy .
mass demonstrations , many of which turned violent , were held following the electoral victory of incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad in presidential elections held on june 12 .
leading moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of the current president .
the authorities deny the charge .

most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
according to the fars news agency , at least 100 of those taken into custody were prominent opposition leaders .
a few days ago , iranian media reported that 20 of the opposition supporters arrested while taking part in some of the earliest demonstrations would be the first to go on trial .
they are charged with " taking part in riots , inciting civil unrest , breaching national security , disturbance of public order and having ties to opposition groups . "
under iran 's islamic law , acting against national security , a common charge against dissenting voices in iran , could be punishable by the death penalty .
on thursday , iranian police and security forces broke up a demonstration by mourners remembering those killed in the recent clashes and prevented mir hussein moussavi from attending , witnesses said .
they added that police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and that the air in several districts was filled with smoke. glb / mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new report out this week says rainy weather , smoking bans and higher prices have put a real dent in beer sales in germany this year . new data released this week by the federal statistics office showed that sales of beer from january to june dropped to their lowest level since the office began keeping track of the numbers back in 1991 .
german breweries sold 49,3 million hectoliters -lrb- 1.1 billion gallons -rrb- of beer in the first half of the year .
that 's down 4.5 percent on the same period last year .
" in addition to the weather conditions , the current increases in beer prices and the ban on smoking in restaurants and so on had an essential impact on the trend in beer sales , " the statistics office said .
breweries across the country say they do n't dare raise prices in an attempt to make up for the lost revenue for fear of ruining sales .
michael weiss , vice president of the federation of german brewers , told german news agency dpa that it was the worst decline in the industry 's modern history .
the czech republic overtook germany in per-capita beer consumption years ago .
the veltins brewery said german beer consumption declined more than five percent in annual terms in the first half of the year , with higher-priced brands like its own worst affected .
among the premium german brands , veltins , warsteiner , bitburger and jever reported slumps ranging from 4.6 to 7 per cent .
veltins did not expect any revival till 2012 .
beer sales have been sliding for years .
beer has gradually fallen out of fashion in germany as people switch to healthy drinks or to other alcoholic beverages such as wine. mrm / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two women in portugal attempted to marry in 2006 .

the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .
" i 'm extremely pleased that political agreement has been reached with ukraine on reform of its gas sector , which opens the way for a financial assistance package to be provided by the international financial institutions to ukraine , " said commission chief jose manuel barroso .
“ the agreement should also provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia , ” he said , adding that that would provide “ the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect . "
price and pay disputes between russia and ukraine have led to serious disruptions to the natural gas supply in recent years across the european union , which relies on russia for around a quarter of its gas consumption .
a payment dispute between moscow and kiev halted european gas deliveries in january , cutting off heating to thousands of homes during a cold snap .
naftogaz says ukraine has to pay a gas bill of around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- on august 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past , russia has accused ukraine of stealing gas from pipelines leading to europe politics or commerce ?
the eu has sought more transparent and commercial terms for how gas is traded between russia and ukraine .
both russia 's gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz are owned by their governments , leading to charges that the trade is more about politics than commerce .
a european commission spokesman said the deal agreed to on friday also allows for an influx of funding totaling 570 million euros from the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- in october .
one of the conditions for the loans is a recapitalization of naftogaz to the tune of two billion dollars , according to the eu commission .
a statement on the ebrd website made it clear that its funding was conditional on ukraine modernizing its energy sector , in particular naftogaz .
" our aim is to improve the sustainability , accountability and above all , the transparency of the ukrainian gas market to the benefit of both ukraine and of energy security in all of europe , " said ebrd president thomas mirow .
an imf official said ukraine would also have to increase its domestic gas prices to bring them into line with international prices. rb / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the renewed tensions come just one week ahead of the first anniversary of the war . georgia on saturday denied firing mortars at the breakaway republic of south ossetia .
south ossetia claimed two mortar rounds were fired at a military observation post from the village of ditsi on the georgian side of the de facto border . also on saturday , moscow warned georgia that its military reserved the right to use force if necessary if the former soviet state continues " provocations " in the caucasas .
georgia , russia trade accusations both sides have accused the other of shelling earlier this week in tskhinvali , the capital of the south ossetian breakaway region , which is recognized as independent by russia .
georgian interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili , speaking to afp in tbilisi , denied any shooting had taken place .
but the russian defense ministry described the alleged georgian actions as an " attempt by the georgian leadership to inflame the situation in the region . "
utiashvili described the statement as " very worrisome " , saying russia " may be searching for a pretext " for military action against georgia .
" we hope the international community will condemn these clearly aggressive actions from the russians , " he said .
the latest tensions between georgia and russia come a week ahead of the august 7 anniversary of the five-day war between the two countries over south ossetia .
a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia was rebuffed by russia .
moscow then sent troops and tanks deep into georgian territory .

" my goal in life , my political goal , is to unite my people , " the self-styled president , eduard kokoity , said during the interview .
" we will build our own state , which will be in alliance with russia , together with russia and i am not excluding that one day , we will be part of russia , " he said .
" the people of south ossetia want to be united with russia . "
south ossetians , who are ethnically distinct from georgians , speak their own farsi-related language and say they have been separated from their fellow people in the neighboring region of north ossetia in russia .
ninety eight percent of south ossetia 's population hold russian passports .
russian is the lingua franca and the russian ruble is the currency used .
kokoity said russia was not yet ready for unification " because this involves a very serious accusation of annexing territory . "

" the trial on saturday was a show and the confessions are invalid ...
what was called a trial was a violation of the constitution , " the site said .
" such show trials will directly harm the system and will further damage public trust . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy .
mass demonstrations , many of which turned violent , were held following the electoral victory of incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad in presidential elections held on june 12 .
leading moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of the current president .
the authorities deny the charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those on trial include prominent opposition members at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
according to the fars news agency , at least 100 of those taken into custody were prominent opposition leaders .
a few days ago , iranian media reported that 20 of the opposition supporters arrested while taking part in some of the earliest demonstrations would be the first to go on trial .
they are charged with " taking part in riots , inciting civil unrest , breaching national security , disturbance of public order and having ties to opposition groups . "
under iran 's islamic law , acting against national security , a common charge against dissenting voices in iran , could be punishable by the death penalty .
on thursday , iranian police and security forces broke up a demonstration by mourners remembering those killed in the recent clashes and prevented mir hussein moussavi from attending , witnesses said .
they added that police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and that the air in several districts was filled with smoke. glb / mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the renewed tensions come just one week ahead of the first anniversary of the war . georgia on saturday denied firing mortars at the breakaway republic of south ossetia .
south ossetia claimed two mortar rounds were fired at a military observation post from the village of ditsi on the georgian side of the de facto border . also on saturday , moscow warned georgia that its military reserved the right to use force if necessary if the former soviet state continues " provocations " in the caucasas .
georgia , russia trade accusations both sides have accused the other of shelling earlier this week in tskhinvali , the capital of the south ossetian breakaway region , which is recognized as independent by russia .
georgian interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili , speaking to afp in tbilisi , denied any shooting had taken place .
but the russian defense ministry described the alleged georgian actions as an " attempt by the georgian leadership to inflame the situation in the region . "
utiashvili described the statement as " very worrisome " , saying russia " may be searching for a pretext " for military action against georgia .
" we hope the international community will condemn these clearly aggressive actions from the russians , " he said .
the latest tensions between georgia and russia come a week ahead of the august 7 anniversary of the five-day war between the two countries over south ossetia .
a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia was rebuffed by russia .
moscow then sent troops and tanks deep into georgian territory .
rebel leader calls for unification with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetian president eduard kokoity would like the region to become part of russia in an interview with the reuters news agency the leader of the rebel enclave of south ossetia said he wanted to unite his people with russia and called on the kremlin to deploy more troops and weapons .
" my goal in life , my political goal , is to unite my people , " the self-styled president , eduard kokoity , said during the interview .
" we will build our own state , which will be in alliance with russia , together with russia and i am not excluding that one day , we will be part of russia , " he said .
" the people of south ossetia want to be united with russia . "
south ossetians , who are ethnically distinct from georgians , speak their own farsi-related language and say they have been separated from their fellow people in the neighboring region of north ossetia in russia .
ninety eight percent of south ossetia 's population hold russian passports .
russian is the lingua franca and the russian ruble is the currency used .
kokoity said russia was not yet ready for unification " because this involves a very serious accusation of annexing territory . "

his comments come amid reports that western soldiers were killed by insurgents in afghanistan on saturday . officials say three us troops and one french soldier were killed in separate attacks in afghanistan on saturday .
the americans were killed in roadside bomb blasts in kandahar province and the french soldier was killed in a gun battle north of the capital , kabul .
the latest deaths in afghanistan come after comments by the new head of nato and former danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen that he would be willing to talk with moderate sections of the taliban to try and win the war there .
barely hours after taking over the reins at nato on aug 1 , rasmussen told the danish newspaper politiken that he favors setting up negotiations with the radical islamist taliban in afghanistan .
however , he emphasized that such a dialogue was only possible with certain sections of the taliban .
" there is certainly a hard core that is impossible to reach any deals with .
they have only respect for military powers , " he told the newspaper , " i certainly do n't know why one should strike any agreements with those who are killing our soldiers . " but he said he would support dialogue with " moderate groups on the outer reaches of the taliban . " and added , " we obviously want to co-operate with those who want to contribute to a safer situation in afghanistan and to create a framework for reconstruction and economic and social development .

officials fear the oil spill could threaten bird sanctuaries and beaches . the oil tanker ' full city ' ran aground off the town of langesund on the norwegian coast after engine failure in stormy conditions , rescue officials said . the joint rescue coordination centre said 16 sailors had been evacuated from the vessel and seven remained on the ship .

a spokesman for the norwegian ministry of coastal affairs halvard wensel confirmed the vessel was leaking diesel oil into the surrounding coastal areas .
wensel said the ship drifted into shallow waters near langesund while moored during a squall early friday morning .
it remains unclear how much oil has leaked into the sea .
the spill is threatening the southern norwegian coast , home to protected seabird colonies .
according to the wwf , the accident took place close to the lille sastein bird sanctuary .

the coast guard , however , said priority had to be given to first saving the 23 crew members . bad weather conditions continue to hamper the operations .
the 167-meter ' full city ' is registered in panama . the vessel was carrying some 1,100 tons of fuel oil. ai / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the trial on saturday was a show and the confessions are invalid ...
what was called a trial was a violation of the constitution , " the site said .
" such show trials will directly harm the system and will further damage public trust . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy .
mass demonstrations , many of which turned violent , were held following the electoral victory of incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad in presidential elections held on june 12 .
leading moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of the current president .
the authorities deny the charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those on trial include prominent opposition members at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
according to the fars news agency , at least 100 of those taken into custody were prominent opposition leaders .
a few days ago , iranian media reported that 20 of the opposition supporters arrested while taking part in some of the earliest demonstrations would be the first to go on trial .
they are charged with " taking part in riots , inciting civil unrest , breaching national security , disturbance of public order and having ties to opposition groups . "
under iran 's islamic law , acting against national security , a common charge against dissenting voices in iran , could be punishable by the death penalty .
on thursday , iranian police and security forces broke up a demonstration by mourners remembering those killed in the recent clashes and prevented mir hussein moussavi from attending , witnesses said .
they added that police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and that the air in several districts was filled with smoke. glb / mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .
" i 'm extremely pleased that political agreement has been reached with ukraine on reform of its gas sector , which opens the way for a financial assistance package to be provided by the international financial institutions to ukraine , " said commission chief jose manuel barroso .
“ the agreement should also provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia , ” he said , adding that that would provide “ the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect . "
price and pay disputes between russia and ukraine have led to serious disruptions to the natural gas supply in recent years across the european union , which relies on russia for around a quarter of its gas consumption .
a payment dispute between moscow and kiev halted european gas deliveries in january , cutting off heating to thousands of homes during a cold snap .
naftogaz says ukraine has to pay a gas bill of around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- on august 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past , russia has accused ukraine of stealing gas from pipelines leading to europe politics or commerce ?
the eu has sought more transparent and commercial terms for how gas is traded between russia and ukraine .
both russia 's gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz are owned by their governments , leading to charges that the trade is more about politics than commerce .
a european commission spokesman said the deal agreed to on friday also allows for an influx of funding totaling 570 million euros from the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- in october .
one of the conditions for the loans is a recapitalization of naftogaz to the tune of two billion dollars , according to the eu commission .
a statement on the ebrd website made it clear that its funding was conditional on ukraine modernizing its energy sector , in particular naftogaz .
" our aim is to improve the sustainability , accountability and above all , the transparency of the ukrainian gas market to the benefit of both ukraine and of energy security in all of europe , " said ebrd president thomas mirow .
an imf official said ukraine would also have to increase its domestic gas prices to bring them into line with international prices. rb / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new report out this week says rainy weather , smoking bans and higher prices have put a real dent in beer sales in germany this year . new data released this week by the federal statistics office showed that sales of beer from january to june dropped to their lowest level since the office began keeping track of the numbers back in 1991 .
german breweries sold 49,3 million hectoliters -lrb- 1.1 billion gallons -rrb- of beer in the first half of the year .
that 's down 4.5 percent on the same period last year .
" in addition to the weather conditions , the current increases in beer prices and the ban on smoking in restaurants and so on had an essential impact on the trend in beer sales , " the statistics office said .
breweries across the country say they do n't dare raise prices in an attempt to make up for the lost revenue for fear of ruining sales .
michael weiss , vice president of the federation of german brewers , told german news agency dpa that it was the worst decline in the industry 's modern history .
the czech republic overtook germany in per-capita beer consumption years ago .
the veltins brewery said german beer consumption declined more than five percent in annual terms in the first half of the year , with higher-priced brands like its own worst affected .
among the premium german brands , veltins , warsteiner , bitburger and jever reported slumps ranging from 4.6 to 7 per cent .
veltins did not expect any revival till 2012 .
beer sales have been sliding for years .

the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .
" i 'm extremely pleased that political agreement has been reached with ukraine on reform of its gas sector , which opens the way for a financial assistance package to be provided by the international financial institutions to ukraine , " said commission chief jose manuel barroso .
“ the agreement should also provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia , ” he said , adding that that would provide “ the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect . "
price and pay disputes between russia and ukraine have led to serious disruptions to the natural gas supply in recent years across the european union , which relies on russia for around a quarter of its gas consumption .
a payment dispute between moscow and kiev halted european gas deliveries in january , cutting off heating to thousands of homes during a cold snap .
naftogaz says ukraine has to pay a gas bill of around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- on august 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past , russia has accused ukraine of stealing gas from pipelines leading to europe politics or commerce ?
the eu has sought more transparent and commercial terms for how gas is traded between russia and ukraine .
both russia 's gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz are owned by their governments , leading to charges that the trade is more about politics than commerce .
a european commission spokesman said the deal agreed to on friday also allows for an influx of funding totaling 570 million euros from the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- in october .
one of the conditions for the loans is a recapitalization of naftogaz to the tune of two billion dollars , according to the eu commission .
a statement on the ebrd website made it clear that its funding was conditional on ukraine modernizing its energy sector , in particular naftogaz .
" our aim is to improve the sustainability , accountability and above all , the transparency of the ukrainian gas market to the benefit of both ukraine and of energy security in all of europe , " said ebrd president thomas mirow .
an imf official said ukraine would also have to increase its domestic gas prices to bring them into line with international prices. rb / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2009 loan deal agreed for ukraine gas bills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dispute between moscow and kiev hit homes and businesses in europe in january the european commission says ukraine has reached a deal with international financial bodies and the eu for payment of russian gas bills .
the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .
" i 'm extremely pleased that political agreement has been reached with ukraine on reform of its gas sector , which opens the way for a financial assistance package to be provided by the international financial institutions to ukraine , " said commission chief jose manuel barroso .
“ the agreement should also provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia , ” he said , adding that that would provide “ the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect . "
price and pay disputes between russia and ukraine have led to serious disruptions to the natural gas supply in recent years across the european union , which relies on russia for around a quarter of its gas consumption .
a payment dispute between moscow and kiev halted european gas deliveries in january , cutting off heating to thousands of homes during a cold snap .
naftogaz says ukraine has to pay a gas bill of around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- on august 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past , russia has accused ukraine of stealing gas from pipelines leading to europe politics or commerce ?
the eu has sought more transparent and commercial terms for how gas is traded between russia and ukraine .
both russia 's gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz are owned by their governments , leading to charges that the trade is more about politics than commerce .
a european commission spokesman said the deal agreed to on friday also allows for an influx of funding totaling 570 million euros from the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- in october .
one of the conditions for the loans is a recapitalization of naftogaz to the tune of two billion dollars , according to the eu commission .
a statement on the ebrd website made it clear that its funding was conditional on ukraine modernizing its energy sector , in particular naftogaz .
" our aim is to improve the sustainability , accountability and above all , the transparency of the ukrainian gas market to the benefit of both ukraine and of energy security in all of europe , " said ebrd president thomas mirow .
an imf official said ukraine would also have to increase its domestic gas prices to bring them into line with international prices. rb / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two women in portugal attempted to marry in 2006 .
after being refused a license by a lisbon registry office , they sued . in a divided ruling against teresa pires and helena paixao , the high court said in a statement that it had reviewed a successful appeal by the two women that reversed an earlier court ruling denying them the right to wed , and reinstated the lower court 's verdict by three votes to two .
the portuguese constitution forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation . the women had been trying since 2006 to overturn the decision using that article .
the two women were turned away by a lisbon registry office because the law stipulates that marriage is between people of different sexes .
the constitutional court said in a statement on july 31 that the constitution does not state that same-sex marriages must be permitted .
on july 29 , prime minister jose socrates and his socialist party presented its manifesto for the sept .
27 general election .
allowing people of the same sex to wed in the predominantly roman catholic country was among the proposals .
the portuguese chapter of the international gay and lesbian association said in a statement : " the decision makes more evident the urgency of solving this issue via parliament by parties wanting to fight discrimination and promote basic equality , " av / ap / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new report out this week says rainy weather , smoking bans and higher prices have put a real dent in beer sales in germany this year . new data released this week by the federal statistics office showed that sales of beer from january to june dropped to their lowest level since the office began keeping track of the numbers back in 1991 .
german breweries sold 49,3 million hectoliters -lrb- 1.1 billion gallons -rrb- of beer in the first half of the year .
that 's down 4.5 percent on the same period last year .
" in addition to the weather conditions , the current increases in beer prices and the ban on smoking in restaurants and so on had an essential impact on the trend in beer sales , " the statistics office said .
breweries across the country say they do n't dare raise prices in an attempt to make up for the lost revenue for fear of ruining sales .
michael weiss , vice president of the federation of german brewers , told german news agency dpa that it was the worst decline in the industry 's modern history .
the czech republic overtook germany in per-capita beer consumption years ago .
the veltins brewery said german beer consumption declined more than five percent in annual terms in the first half of the year , with higher-priced brands like its own worst affected .
among the premium german brands , veltins , warsteiner , bitburger and jever reported slumps ranging from 4.6 to 7 per cent .
veltins did not expect any revival till 2012 .
beer sales have been sliding for years .

" the trial on saturday was a show and the confessions are invalid ...
what was called a trial was a violation of the constitution , " the site said .
" such show trials will directly harm the system and will further damage public trust . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy .
mass demonstrations , many of which turned violent , were held following the electoral victory of incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad in presidential elections held on june 12 .
leading moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of the current president .
the authorities deny the charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those on trial include prominent opposition members at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
according to the fars news agency , at least 100 of those taken into custody were prominent opposition leaders .
a few days ago , iranian media reported that 20 of the opposition supporters arrested while taking part in some of the earliest demonstrations would be the first to go on trial .
they are charged with " taking part in riots , inciting civil unrest , breaching national security , disturbance of public order and having ties to opposition groups . "
under iran 's islamic law , acting against national security , a common charge against dissenting voices in iran , could be punishable by the death penalty .
on thursday , iranian police and security forces broke up a demonstration by mourners remembering those killed in the recent clashes and prevented mir hussein moussavi from attending , witnesses said .
they added that police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and that the air in several districts was filled with smoke. glb / mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the trial on saturday was a show and the confessions are invalid ...
what was called a trial was a violation of the constitution , " the site said .
" such show trials will directly harm the system and will further damage public trust . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy .
mass demonstrations , many of which turned violent , were held following the electoral victory of incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad in presidential elections held on june 12 .
leading moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of the current president .
the authorities deny the charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those on trial include prominent opposition members at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
according to the fars news agency , at least 100 of those taken into custody were prominent opposition leaders .
a few days ago , iranian media reported that 20 of the opposition supporters arrested while taking part in some of the earliest demonstrations would be the first to go on trial .
they are charged with " taking part in riots , inciting civil unrest , breaching national security , disturbance of public order and having ties to opposition groups . "
under iran 's islamic law , acting against national security , a common charge against dissenting voices in iran , could be punishable by the death penalty .
on thursday , iranian police and security forces broke up a demonstration by mourners remembering those killed in the recent clashes and prevented mir hussein moussavi from attending , witnesses said .
they added that police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and that the air in several districts was filled with smoke. glb / mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have slammed the move as state censorship . diosdado cabello , the head of national telecommunications regulator conatel and minister of public works in president hugo chavez 's leftist government , said the decision to close the stations was part of " a new phase of information . "
cabello said the closures were due to the stations ' failures to meet legal operating requirements , and warned that more closures may follow .
he defended the closures , saying they were part of the government 's effort to " democratize the airwaves . "
but critics said the crackdown was arbitrary and the owners were not given the right to a proper defense .
the venezuelan chamber of radio broadcasters described the decision as an " enormous violation . "
freedom of expression the decision to shut down the 34 stations came one day after luisa ortega diaz , venezuela 's top prosecutor , suggested toughening the country 's media law to " regulate the freedom of expression . " it is not the first time chavez has recalled the licences of broadcasters considered critical of the government . opposition broadcaster globovision , which the president accused of " media terrorism , " has often been threatened with having its license revoked .
the broadcaster has also been slapped with hefty fines . in 2007 , chavez did not renew the license for a widely watched private tv station , rctv , that was a persistent critic of the government .
analysts believe the move is part of chavez 's payback to the media owners , who he has never forgiven for backing a failed coup against him in 2002 .
in total , 240 radio stations are under investigation , representing 40 per cent of the nation 's broadcasters . td / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his comments come amid reports that western soldiers were killed by insurgents in afghanistan on saturday . officials say three us troops and one french soldier were killed in separate attacks in afghanistan on saturday .
the americans were killed in roadside bomb blasts in kandahar province and the french soldier was killed in a gun battle north of the capital , kabul .
the latest deaths in afghanistan come after comments by the new head of nato and former danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen that he would be willing to talk with moderate sections of the taliban to try and win the war there .
barely hours after taking over the reins at nato on aug 1 , rasmussen told the danish newspaper politiken that he favors setting up negotiations with the radical islamist taliban in afghanistan .
however , he emphasized that such a dialogue was only possible with certain sections of the taliban .
" there is certainly a hard core that is impossible to reach any deals with .
they have only respect for military powers , " he told the newspaper , " i certainly do n't know why one should strike any agreements with those who are killing our soldiers . " but he said he would support dialogue with " moderate groups on the outer reaches of the taliban . " and added , " we obviously want to co-operate with those who want to contribute to a safer situation in afghanistan and to create a framework for reconstruction and economic and social development . " rising casualties and low morale the conflict in afghanistan is the largest military campaign in nato 's history .
it 's also the bloodiest , with over 1,000 western troops killed since the alliance began operations in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are doubting the afghan mission as casulties add up there are around 90,000 international troops under the nato military alliance and us-led coalition command in afghanistan , fighting alongside afghan forces against the taliban and other radical groups . but the insurgency against the western-backed afghan government has steadily worsened despite a growing international presence . rasmussen will have to try to persuade reluctant european allies to commit more troops , money and other resources to afghanistan at a time when opinion polls show public support for the war waning as casualties grow . many nato members have begun to lose faith in the mission , and one by one they have begun making plans to pull out their troops . the dutch are expected to recall their soldiers from afghanistan next year , and canada is debating a 2011 pull-out .
meanwhile , great britain 's role in the conflict has come under fire at home after 22 soldiers were killed during fighting last month alone. mrm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the trial on saturday was a show and the confessions are invalid ...
what was called a trial was a violation of the constitution , " the site said .
" such show trials will directly harm the system and will further damage public trust . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy .
mass demonstrations , many of which turned violent , were held following the electoral victory of incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad in presidential elections held on june 12 .
leading moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of the current president .
the authorities deny the charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those on trial include prominent opposition members at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
according to the fars news agency , at least 100 of those taken into custody were prominent opposition leaders .
a few days ago , iranian media reported that 20 of the opposition supporters arrested while taking part in some of the earliest demonstrations would be the first to go on trial .
they are charged with " taking part in riots , inciting civil unrest , breaching national security , disturbance of public order and having ties to opposition groups . "
under iran 's islamic law , acting against national security , a common charge against dissenting voices in iran , could be punishable by the death penalty .
on thursday , iranian police and security forces broke up a demonstration by mourners remembering those killed in the recent clashes and prevented mir hussein moussavi from attending , witnesses said .
they added that police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and that the air in several districts was filled with smoke. glb / mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the trial on saturday was a show and the confessions are invalid ...
what was called a trial was a violation of the constitution , " the site said .
" such show trials will directly harm the system and will further damage public trust . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy .
mass demonstrations , many of which turned violent , were held following the electoral victory of incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad in presidential elections held on june 12 .
leading moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of the current president .
the authorities deny the charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those on trial include prominent opposition members at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
according to the fars news agency , at least 100 of those taken into custody were prominent opposition leaders .
a few days ago , iranian media reported that 20 of the opposition supporters arrested while taking part in some of the earliest demonstrations would be the first to go on trial .
they are charged with " taking part in riots , inciting civil unrest , breaching national security , disturbance of public order and having ties to opposition groups . "
under iran 's islamic law , acting against national security , a common charge against dissenting voices in iran , could be punishable by the death penalty .
on thursday , iranian police and security forces broke up a demonstration by mourners remembering those killed in the recent clashes and prevented mir hussein moussavi from attending , witnesses said .
they added that police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and that the air in several districts was filled with smoke. glb / mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new report out this week says rainy weather , smoking bans and higher prices have put a real dent in beer sales in germany this year . new data released this week by the federal statistics office showed that sales of beer from january to june dropped to their lowest level since the office began keeping track of the numbers back in 1991 .
german breweries sold 49,3 million hectoliters -lrb- 1.1 billion gallons -rrb- of beer in the first half of the year .
that 's down 4.5 percent on the same period last year .
" in addition to the weather conditions , the current increases in beer prices and the ban on smoking in restaurants and so on had an essential impact on the trend in beer sales , " the statistics office said .
breweries across the country say they do n't dare raise prices in an attempt to make up for the lost revenue for fear of ruining sales .
michael weiss , vice president of the federation of german brewers , told german news agency dpa that it was the worst decline in the industry 's modern history .
the czech republic overtook germany in per-capita beer consumption years ago .
the veltins brewery said german beer consumption declined more than five percent in annual terms in the first half of the year , with higher-priced brands like its own worst affected .
among the premium german brands , veltins , warsteiner , bitburger and jever reported slumps ranging from 4.6 to 7 per cent .
veltins did not expect any revival till 2012 .
beer sales have been sliding for years .
beer has gradually fallen out of fashion in germany as people switch to healthy drinks or to other alcoholic beverages such as wine. mrm / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have slammed the move as state censorship . diosdado cabello , the head of national telecommunications regulator conatel and minister of public works in president hugo chavez 's leftist government , said the decision to close the stations was part of " a new phase of information . "
cabello said the closures were due to the stations ' failures to meet legal operating requirements , and warned that more closures may follow .
he defended the closures , saying they were part of the government 's effort to " democratize the airwaves . "
but critics said the crackdown was arbitrary and the owners were not given the right to a proper defense .
the venezuelan chamber of radio broadcasters described the decision as an " enormous violation . "
freedom of expression the decision to shut down the 34 stations came one day after luisa ortega diaz , venezuela 's top prosecutor , suggested toughening the country 's media law to " regulate the freedom of expression . " it is not the first time chavez has recalled the licences of broadcasters considered critical of the government . opposition broadcaster globovision , which the president accused of " media terrorism , " has often been threatened with having its license revoked .
the broadcaster has also been slapped with hefty fines . in 2007 , chavez did not renew the license for a widely watched private tv station , rctv , that was a persistent critic of the government .
analysts believe the move is part of chavez 's payback to the media owners , who he has never forgiven for backing a failed coup against him in 2002 .

officials fear the oil spill could threaten bird sanctuaries and beaches . the oil tanker ' full city ' ran aground off the town of langesund on the norwegian coast after engine failure in stormy conditions , rescue officials said . the joint rescue coordination centre said 16 sailors had been evacuated from the vessel and seven remained on the ship .
the entire crew are chinese nationals .
a spokesman for the norwegian ministry of coastal affairs halvard wensel confirmed the vessel was leaking diesel oil into the surrounding coastal areas .
wensel said the ship drifted into shallow waters near langesund while moored during a squall early friday morning .
it remains unclear how much oil has leaked into the sea .
the spill is threatening the southern norwegian coast , home to protected seabird colonies .
according to the wwf , the accident took place close to the lille sastein bird sanctuary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil spill is threatening to reach the olso fjord and kristiansand environmental groups warn that wind and current could carry the spill to the nearby town of larvik and further into the oslo fjord and even to the town of kristiansand some 200 kilometers away .
norway 's wildlife trust has criticized authorities for reacting too late in putting in place a floating oil barrier .
the coast guard , however , said priority had to be given to first saving the 23 crew members . bad weather conditions continue to hamper the operations .

officials fear the oil spill could threaten bird sanctuaries and beaches . the oil tanker ' full city ' ran aground off the town of langesund on the norwegian coast after engine failure in stormy conditions , rescue officials said . the joint rescue coordination centre said 16 sailors had been evacuated from the vessel and seven remained on the ship .
the entire crew are chinese nationals .
a spokesman for the norwegian ministry of coastal affairs halvard wensel confirmed the vessel was leaking diesel oil into the surrounding coastal areas .
wensel said the ship drifted into shallow waters near langesund while moored during a squall early friday morning .
it remains unclear how much oil has leaked into the sea .
the spill is threatening the southern norwegian coast , home to protected seabird colonies .
according to the wwf , the accident took place close to the lille sastein bird sanctuary .

a new report out this week says rainy weather , smoking bans and higher prices have put a real dent in beer sales in germany this year . new data released this week by the federal statistics office showed that sales of beer from january to june dropped to their lowest level since the office began keeping track of the numbers back in 1991 .
german breweries sold 49,3 million hectoliters -lrb- 1.1 billion gallons -rrb- of beer in the first half of the year .
that 's down 4.5 percent on the same period last year .
" in addition to the weather conditions , the current increases in beer prices and the ban on smoking in restaurants and so on had an essential impact on the trend in beer sales , " the statistics office said .
breweries across the country say they do n't dare raise prices in an attempt to make up for the lost revenue for fear of ruining sales .
michael weiss , vice president of the federation of german brewers , told german news agency dpa that it was the worst decline in the industry 's modern history .
the czech republic overtook germany in per-capita beer consumption years ago .
the veltins brewery said german beer consumption declined more than five percent in annual terms in the first half of the year , with higher-priced brands like its own worst affected .
among the premium german brands , veltins , warsteiner , bitburger and jever reported slumps ranging from 4.6 to 7 per cent .
veltins did not expect any revival till 2012 .

his comments come amid reports that western soldiers were killed by insurgents in afghanistan on saturday . officials say three us troops and one french soldier were killed in separate attacks in afghanistan on saturday .
the americans were killed in roadside bomb blasts in kandahar province and the french soldier was killed in a gun battle north of the capital , kabul .
the latest deaths in afghanistan come after comments by the new head of nato and former danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen that he would be willing to talk with moderate sections of the taliban to try and win the war there .
barely hours after taking over the reins at nato on aug 1 , rasmussen told the danish newspaper politiken that he favors setting up negotiations with the radical islamist taliban in afghanistan .
however , he emphasized that such a dialogue was only possible with certain sections of the taliban .
" there is certainly a hard core that is impossible to reach any deals with .
they have only respect for military powers , " he told the newspaper , " i certainly do n't know why one should strike any agreements with those who are killing our soldiers . " but he said he would support dialogue with " moderate groups on the outer reaches of the taliban . " and added , " we obviously want to co-operate with those who want to contribute to a safer situation in afghanistan and to create a framework for reconstruction and economic and social development . " rising casualties and low morale the conflict in afghanistan is the largest military campaign in nato 's history .
it 's also the bloodiest , with over 1,000 western troops killed since the alliance began operations in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are doubting the afghan mission as casulties add up there are around 90,000 international troops under the nato military alliance and us-led coalition command in afghanistan , fighting alongside afghan forces against the taliban and other radical groups . but the insurgency against the western-backed afghan government has steadily worsened despite a growing international presence . rasmussen will have to try to persuade reluctant european allies to commit more troops , money and other resources to afghanistan at a time when opinion polls show public support for the war waning as casualties grow . many nato members have begun to lose faith in the mission , and one by one they have begun making plans to pull out their troops . the dutch are expected to recall their soldiers from afghanistan next year , and canada is debating a 2011 pull-out .
meanwhile , great britain 's role in the conflict has come under fire at home after 22 soldiers were killed during fighting last month alone. mrm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two women in portugal attempted to marry in 2006 .
after being refused a license by a lisbon registry office , they sued . in a divided ruling against teresa pires and helena paixao , the high court said in a statement that it had reviewed a successful appeal by the two women that reversed an earlier court ruling denying them the right to wed , and reinstated the lower court 's verdict by three votes to two .
the portuguese constitution forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation . the women had been trying since 2006 to overturn the decision using that article .
the two women were turned away by a lisbon registry office because the law stipulates that marriage is between people of different sexes .
the constitutional court said in a statement on july 31 that the constitution does not state that same-sex marriages must be permitted .
on july 29 , prime minister jose socrates and his socialist party presented its manifesto for the sept .
27 general election .
allowing people of the same sex to wed in the predominantly roman catholic country was among the proposals .
the portuguese chapter of the international gay and lesbian association said in a statement : " the decision makes more evident the urgency of solving this issue via parliament by parties wanting to fight discrimination and promote basic equality , " av / ap / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .

the renewed tensions come just one week ahead of the first anniversary of the war . georgia on saturday denied firing mortars at the breakaway republic of south ossetia .
south ossetia claimed two mortar rounds were fired at a military observation post from the village of ditsi on the georgian side of the de facto border . also on saturday , moscow warned georgia that its military reserved the right to use force if necessary if the former soviet state continues " provocations " in the caucasas .
georgia , russia trade accusations both sides have accused the other of shelling earlier this week in tskhinvali , the capital of the south ossetian breakaway region , which is recognized as independent by russia .
georgian interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili , speaking to afp in tbilisi , denied any shooting had taken place .
but the russian defense ministry described the alleged georgian actions as an " attempt by the georgian leadership to inflame the situation in the region . "
utiashvili described the statement as " very worrisome " , saying russia " may be searching for a pretext " for military action against georgia .
" we hope the international community will condemn these clearly aggressive actions from the russians , " he said .
the latest tensions between georgia and russia come a week ahead of the august 7 anniversary of the five-day war between the two countries over south ossetia .

the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .
" i 'm extremely pleased that political agreement has been reached with ukraine on reform of its gas sector , which opens the way for a financial assistance package to be provided by the international financial institutions to ukraine , " said commission chief jose manuel barroso .
“ the agreement should also provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia , ” he said , adding that that would provide “ the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect . "
price and pay disputes between russia and ukraine have led to serious disruptions to the natural gas supply in recent years across the european union , which relies on russia for around a quarter of its gas consumption .
a payment dispute between moscow and kiev halted european gas deliveries in january , cutting off heating to thousands of homes during a cold snap .
naftogaz says ukraine has to pay a gas bill of around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- on august 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past , russia has accused ukraine of stealing gas from pipelines leading to europe politics or commerce ?
the eu has sought more transparent and commercial terms for how gas is traded between russia and ukraine .
both russia 's gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz are owned by their governments , leading to charges that the trade is more about politics than commerce .
a european commission spokesman said the deal agreed to on friday also allows for an influx of funding totaling 570 million euros from the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- in october .
one of the conditions for the loans is a recapitalization of naftogaz to the tune of two billion dollars , according to the eu commission .
a statement on the ebrd website made it clear that its funding was conditional on ukraine modernizing its energy sector , in particular naftogaz .
" our aim is to improve the sustainability , accountability and above all , the transparency of the ukrainian gas market to the benefit of both ukraine and of energy security in all of europe , " said ebrd president thomas mirow .
an imf official said ukraine would also have to increase its domestic gas prices to bring them into line with international prices. rb / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two women in portugal attempted to marry in 2006 .
after being refused a license by a lisbon registry office , they sued . in a divided ruling against teresa pires and helena paixao , the high court said in a statement that it had reviewed a successful appeal by the two women that reversed an earlier court ruling denying them the right to wed , and reinstated the lower court 's verdict by three votes to two .
the portuguese constitution forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation . the women had been trying since 2006 to overturn the decision using that article .
the two women were turned away by a lisbon registry office because the law stipulates that marriage is between people of different sexes .
the constitutional court said in a statement on july 31 that the constitution does not state that same-sex marriages must be permitted .
on july 29 , prime minister jose socrates and his socialist party presented its manifesto for the sept .
27 general election .
allowing people of the same sex to wed in the predominantly roman catholic country was among the proposals .
the portuguese chapter of the international gay and lesbian association said in a statement : " the decision makes more evident the urgency of solving this issue via parliament by parties wanting to fight discrimination and promote basic equality , " av / ap / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two women in portugal attempted to marry in 2006 .
after being refused a license by a lisbon registry office , they sued . in a divided ruling against teresa pires and helena paixao , the high court said in a statement that it had reviewed a successful appeal by the two women that reversed an earlier court ruling denying them the right to wed , and reinstated the lower court 's verdict by three votes to two .
the portuguese constitution forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation . the women had been trying since 2006 to overturn the decision using that article .
the two women were turned away by a lisbon registry office because the law stipulates that marriage is between people of different sexes .
the constitutional court said in a statement on july 31 that the constitution does not state that same-sex marriages must be permitted .
on july 29 , prime minister jose socrates and his socialist party presented its manifesto for the sept .
27 general election .
allowing people of the same sex to wed in the predominantly roman catholic country was among the proposals .
the portuguese chapter of the international gay and lesbian association said in a statement : " the decision makes more evident the urgency of solving this issue via parliament by parties wanting to fight discrimination and promote basic equality , " av / ap / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the trial on saturday was a show and the confessions are invalid ...
what was called a trial was a violation of the constitution , " the site said .
" such show trials will directly harm the system and will further damage public trust . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy .
mass demonstrations , many of which turned violent , were held following the electoral victory of incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad in presidential elections held on june 12 .

according to the fars news agency , at least 100 of those taken into custody were prominent opposition leaders .
a few days ago , iranian media reported that 20 of the opposition supporters arrested while taking part in some of the earliest demonstrations would be the first to go on trial .
they are charged with " taking part in riots , inciting civil unrest , breaching national security , disturbance of public order and having ties to opposition groups . "
under iran 's islamic law , acting against national security , a common charge against dissenting voices in iran , could be punishable by the death penalty .
on thursday , iranian police and security forces broke up a demonstration by mourners remembering those killed in the recent clashes and prevented mir hussein moussavi from attending , witnesses said .
they added that police used tear gas to disperse the crowds and that the air in several districts was filled with smoke. glb / mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the americans were killed in roadside bomb blasts in kandahar province and the french soldier was killed in a gun battle north of the capital , kabul .
the latest deaths in afghanistan come after comments by the new head of nato and former danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen that he would be willing to talk with moderate sections of the taliban to try and win the war there .
barely hours after taking over the reins at nato on aug 1 , rasmussen told the danish newspaper politiken that he favors setting up negotiations with the radical islamist taliban in afghanistan .

" there is certainly a hard core that is impossible to reach any deals with .
they have only respect for military powers , " he told the newspaper , " i certainly do n't know why one should strike any agreements with those who are killing our soldiers . " but he said he would support dialogue with " moderate groups on the outer reaches of the taliban .

his comments come amid reports that western soldiers were killed by insurgents in afghanistan on saturday . officials say three us troops and one french soldier were killed in separate attacks in afghanistan on saturday .
the americans were killed in roadside bomb blasts in kandahar province and the french soldier was killed in a gun battle north of the capital , kabul .
the latest deaths in afghanistan come after comments by the new head of nato and former danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen that he would be willing to talk with moderate sections of the taliban to try and win the war there .
barely hours after taking over the reins at nato on aug 1 , rasmussen told the danish newspaper politiken that he favors setting up negotiations with the radical islamist taliban in afghanistan .
however , he emphasized that such a dialogue was only possible with certain sections of the taliban .
" there is certainly a hard core that is impossible to reach any deals with .
they have only respect for military powers , " he told the newspaper , " i certainly do n't know why one should strike any agreements with those who are killing our soldiers . " but he said he would support dialogue with " moderate groups on the outer reaches of the taliban .

critics have slammed the move as state censorship . diosdado cabello , the head of national telecommunications regulator conatel and minister of public works in president hugo chavez 's leftist government , said the decision to close the stations was part of " a new phase of information . "
cabello said the closures were due to the stations ' failures to meet legal operating requirements , and warned that more closures may follow .
he defended the closures , saying they were part of the government 's effort to " democratize the airwaves . "
but critics said the crackdown was arbitrary and the owners were not given the right to a proper defense .
the venezuelan chamber of radio broadcasters described the decision as an " enormous violation . "
freedom of expression the decision to shut down the 34 stations came one day after luisa ortega diaz , venezuela 's top prosecutor , suggested toughening the country 's media law to " regulate the freedom of expression . " it is not the first time chavez has recalled the licences of broadcasters considered critical of the government . opposition broadcaster globovision , which the president accused of " media terrorism , " has often been threatened with having its license revoked .
the broadcaster has also been slapped with hefty fines . in 2007 , chavez did not renew the license for a widely watched private tv station , rctv , that was a persistent critic of the government .
analysts believe the move is part of chavez 's payback to the media owners , who he has never forgiven for backing a failed coup against him in 2002 .

critics have slammed the move as state censorship . diosdado cabello , the head of national telecommunications regulator conatel and minister of public works in president hugo chavez 's leftist government , said the decision to close the stations was part of " a new phase of information . "
cabello said the closures were due to the stations ' failures to meet legal operating requirements , and warned that more closures may follow .
he defended the closures , saying they were part of the government 's effort to " democratize the airwaves . "
but critics said the crackdown was arbitrary and the owners were not given the right to a proper defense .
the venezuelan chamber of radio broadcasters described the decision as an " enormous violation . "
freedom of expression the decision to shut down the 34 stations came one day after luisa ortega diaz , venezuela 's top prosecutor , suggested toughening the country 's media law to " regulate the freedom of expression . " it is not the first time chavez has recalled the licences of broadcasters considered critical of the government . opposition broadcaster globovision , which the president accused of " media terrorism , " has often been threatened with having its license revoked .
the broadcaster has also been slapped with hefty fines . in 2007 , chavez did not renew the license for a widely watched private tv station , rctv , that was a persistent critic of the government .
analysts believe the move is part of chavez 's payback to the media owners , who he has never forgiven for backing a failed coup against him in 2002 .
in total , 240 radio stations are under investigation , representing 40 per cent of the nation 's broadcasters . td / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two women in portugal attempted to marry in 2006 .
after being refused a license by a lisbon registry office , they sued . in a divided ruling against teresa pires and helena paixao , the high court said in a statement that it had reviewed a successful appeal by the two women that reversed an earlier court ruling denying them the right to wed , and reinstated the lower court 's verdict by three votes to two .
the portuguese constitution forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation . the women had been trying since 2006 to overturn the decision using that article .
the two women were turned away by a lisbon registry office because the law stipulates that marriage is between people of different sexes .
the constitutional court said in a statement on july 31 that the constitution does not state that same-sex marriages must be permitted .
on july 29 , prime minister jose socrates and his socialist party presented its manifesto for the sept .
27 general election .
allowing people of the same sex to wed in the predominantly roman catholic country was among the proposals .
the portuguese chapter of the international gay and lesbian association said in a statement : " the decision makes more evident the urgency of solving this issue via parliament by parties wanting to fight discrimination and promote basic equality , " av / ap / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the renewed tensions come just one week ahead of the first anniversary of the war . georgia on saturday denied firing mortars at the breakaway republic of south ossetia .
south ossetia claimed two mortar rounds were fired at a military observation post from the village of ditsi on the georgian side of the de facto border . also on saturday , moscow warned georgia that its military reserved the right to use force if necessary if the former soviet state continues " provocations " in the caucasas .
georgia , russia trade accusations both sides have accused the other of shelling earlier this week in tskhinvali , the capital of the south ossetian breakaway region , which is recognized as independent by russia .
georgian interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili , speaking to afp in tbilisi , denied any shooting had taken place .
but the russian defense ministry described the alleged georgian actions as an " attempt by the georgian leadership to inflame the situation in the region . "
utiashvili described the statement as " very worrisome " , saying russia " may be searching for a pretext " for military action against georgia .
" we hope the international community will condemn these clearly aggressive actions from the russians , " he said .
the latest tensions between georgia and russia come a week ahead of the august 7 anniversary of the five-day war between the two countries over south ossetia .
a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia was rebuffed by russia .
moscow then sent troops and tanks deep into georgian territory .
rebel leader calls for unification with russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetian president eduard kokoity would like the region to become part of russia in an interview with the reuters news agency the leader of the rebel enclave of south ossetia said he wanted to unite his people with russia and called on the kremlin to deploy more troops and weapons .
" my goal in life , my political goal , is to unite my people , " the self-styled president , eduard kokoity , said during the interview .
" we will build our own state , which will be in alliance with russia , together with russia and i am not excluding that one day , we will be part of russia , " he said .
" the people of south ossetia want to be united with russia . "
south ossetians , who are ethnically distinct from georgians , speak their own farsi-related language and say they have been separated from their fellow people in the neighboring region of north ossetia in russia .
ninety eight percent of south ossetia 's population hold russian passports .
russian is the lingua franca and the russian ruble is the currency used .
kokoity said russia was not yet ready for unification " because this involves a very serious accusation of annexing territory . "
" if ossetia is united , then i shall leave the political arena for good . " mrm / reuters / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .
" i 'm extremely pleased that political agreement has been reached with ukraine on reform of its gas sector , which opens the way for a financial assistance package to be provided by the international financial institutions to ukraine , " said commission chief jose manuel barroso .
“ the agreement should also provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia , ” he said , adding that that would provide “ the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect . "
price and pay disputes between russia and ukraine have led to serious disruptions to the natural gas supply in recent years across the european union , which relies on russia for around a quarter of its gas consumption .

the renewed tensions come just one week ahead of the first anniversary of the war . georgia on saturday denied firing mortars at the breakaway republic of south ossetia .
south ossetia claimed two mortar rounds were fired at a military observation post from the village of ditsi on the georgian side of the de facto border . also on saturday , moscow warned georgia that its military reserved the right to use force if necessary if the former soviet state continues " provocations " in the caucasas .
georgia , russia trade accusations both sides have accused the other of shelling earlier this week in tskhinvali , the capital of the south ossetian breakaway region , which is recognized as independent by russia .
georgian interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili , speaking to afp in tbilisi , denied any shooting had taken place .
but the russian defense ministry described the alleged georgian actions as an " attempt by the georgian leadership to inflame the situation in the region . "
utiashvili described the statement as " very worrisome " , saying russia " may be searching for a pretext " for military action against georgia .
" we hope the international community will condemn these clearly aggressive actions from the russians , " he said .
the latest tensions between georgia and russia come a week ahead of the august 7 anniversary of the five-day war between the two countries over south ossetia .
a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia was rebuffed by russia .
moscow then sent troops and tanks deep into georgian territory .

" we will build our own state , which will be in alliance with russia , together with russia and i am not excluding that one day , we will be part of russia , " he said .
" the people of south ossetia want to be united with russia . "
south ossetians , who are ethnically distinct from georgians , speak their own farsi-related language and say they have been separated from their fellow people in the neighboring region of north ossetia in russia .
ninety eight percent of south ossetia 's population hold russian passports .
russian is the lingua franca and the russian ruble is the currency used .
kokoity said russia was not yet ready for unification " because this involves a very serious accusation of annexing territory . "

two women in portugal attempted to marry in 2006 .
after being refused a license by a lisbon registry office , they sued . in a divided ruling against teresa pires and helena paixao , the high court said in a statement that it had reviewed a successful appeal by the two women that reversed an earlier court ruling denying them the right to wed , and reinstated the lower court 's verdict by three votes to two .
the portuguese constitution forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation . the women had been trying since 2006 to overturn the decision using that article .
the two women were turned away by a lisbon registry office because the law stipulates that marriage is between people of different sexes .
the constitutional court said in a statement on july 31 that the constitution does not state that same-sex marriages must be permitted .
on july 29 , prime minister jose socrates and his socialist party presented its manifesto for the sept .
27 general election .
allowing people of the same sex to wed in the predominantly roman catholic country was among the proposals .

" the trial on saturday was a show and the confessions are invalid ...
what was called a trial was a violation of the constitution , " the site said .
" such show trials will directly harm the system and will further damage public trust . "
more than 100 people went on trial on saturday , including several leading reformists , on charges including rioting , vandalism , and conspiracy .
mass demonstrations , many of which turned violent , were held following the electoral victory of incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad in presidential elections held on june 12 .
leading moderates say the vote was rigged in favor of the current president .
the authorities deny the charge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those on trial include prominent opposition members at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have been released , though there are still around 250 in jail .
according to the fars news agency , at least 100 of those taken into custody were prominent opposition leaders .
a few days ago , iranian media reported that 20 of the opposition supporters arrested while taking part in some of the earliest demonstrations would be the first to go on trial .
they are charged with " taking part in riots , inciting civil unrest , breaching national security , disturbance of public order and having ties to opposition groups . "
under iran 's islamic law , acting against national security , a common charge against dissenting voices in iran , could be punishable by the death penalty .

a new report out this week says rainy weather , smoking bans and higher prices have put a real dent in beer sales in germany this year . new data released this week by the federal statistics office showed that sales of beer from january to june dropped to their lowest level since the office began keeping track of the numbers back in 1991 .
german breweries sold 49,3 million hectoliters -lrb- 1.1 billion gallons -rrb- of beer in the first half of the year .
that 's down 4.5 percent on the same period last year .
" in addition to the weather conditions , the current increases in beer prices and the ban on smoking in restaurants and so on had an essential impact on the trend in beer sales , " the statistics office said .
breweries across the country say they do n't dare raise prices in an attempt to make up for the lost revenue for fear of ruining sales .
michael weiss , vice president of the federation of german brewers , told german news agency dpa that it was the worst decline in the industry 's modern history .
the czech republic overtook germany in per-capita beer consumption years ago .
the veltins brewery said german beer consumption declined more than five percent in annual terms in the first half of the year , with higher-priced brands like its own worst affected .
among the premium german brands , veltins , warsteiner , bitburger and jever reported slumps ranging from 4.6 to 7 per cent .
veltins did not expect any revival till 2012 .
beer sales have been sliding for years .
beer has gradually fallen out of fashion in germany as people switch to healthy drinks or to other alcoholic beverages such as wine. mrm / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

officials fear the oil spill could threaten bird sanctuaries and beaches . the oil tanker ' full city ' ran aground off the town of langesund on the norwegian coast after engine failure in stormy conditions , rescue officials said . the joint rescue coordination centre said 16 sailors had been evacuated from the vessel and seven remained on the ship .
the entire crew are chinese nationals .
a spokesman for the norwegian ministry of coastal affairs halvard wensel confirmed the vessel was leaking diesel oil into the surrounding coastal areas .
wensel said the ship drifted into shallow waters near langesund while moored during a squall early friday morning .
it remains unclear how much oil has leaked into the sea .
the spill is threatening the southern norwegian coast , home to protected seabird colonies .
according to the wwf , the accident took place close to the lille sastein bird sanctuary .

norway 's wildlife trust has criticized authorities for reacting too late in putting in place a floating oil barrier .
the coast guard , however , said priority had to be given to first saving the 23 crew members . bad weather conditions continue to hamper the operations .
the 167-meter ' full city ' is registered in panama . the vessel was carrying some 1,100 tons of fuel oil. ai / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have slammed the move as state censorship . diosdado cabello , the head of national telecommunications regulator conatel and minister of public works in president hugo chavez 's leftist government , said the decision to close the stations was part of " a new phase of information . "
cabello said the closures were due to the stations ' failures to meet legal operating requirements , and warned that more closures may follow .
he defended the closures , saying they were part of the government 's effort to " democratize the airwaves . "
but critics said the crackdown was arbitrary and the owners were not given the right to a proper defense .
the venezuelan chamber of radio broadcasters described the decision as an " enormous violation . "
freedom of expression the decision to shut down the 34 stations came one day after luisa ortega diaz , venezuela 's top prosecutor , suggested toughening the country 's media law to " regulate the freedom of expression . " it is not the first time chavez has recalled the licences of broadcasters considered critical of the government . opposition broadcaster globovision , which the president accused of " media terrorism , " has often been threatened with having its license revoked .
the broadcaster has also been slapped with hefty fines . in 2007 , chavez did not renew the license for a widely watched private tv station , rctv , that was a persistent critic of the government .
analysts believe the move is part of chavez 's payback to the media owners , who he has never forgiven for backing a failed coup against him in 2002 .
in total , 240 radio stations are under investigation , representing 40 per cent of the nation 's broadcasters . td / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have slammed the move as state censorship . diosdado cabello , the head of national telecommunications regulator conatel and minister of public works in president hugo chavez 's leftist government , said the decision to close the stations was part of " a new phase of information . "
cabello said the closures were due to the stations ' failures to meet legal operating requirements , and warned that more closures may follow .
he defended the closures , saying they were part of the government 's effort to " democratize the airwaves . "
but critics said the crackdown was arbitrary and the owners were not given the right to a proper defense .
the venezuelan chamber of radio broadcasters described the decision as an " enormous violation . "
freedom of expression the decision to shut down the 34 stations came one day after luisa ortega diaz , venezuela 's top prosecutor , suggested toughening the country 's media law to " regulate the freedom of expression . " it is not the first time chavez has recalled the licences of broadcasters considered critical of the government . opposition broadcaster globovision , which the president accused of " media terrorism , " has often been threatened with having its license revoked .
the broadcaster has also been slapped with hefty fines . in 2007 , chavez did not renew the license for a widely watched private tv station , rctv , that was a persistent critic of the government .
analysts believe the move is part of chavez 's payback to the media owners , who he has never forgiven for backing a failed coup against him in 2002 .
in total , 240 radio stations are under investigation , representing 40 per cent of the nation 's broadcasters . td / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2009 loan deal agreed for ukraine gas bills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dispute between moscow and kiev hit homes and businesses in europe in january the european commission says ukraine has reached a deal with international financial bodies and the eu for payment of russian gas bills .
the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .
" i 'm extremely pleased that political agreement has been reached with ukraine on reform of its gas sector , which opens the way for a financial assistance package to be provided by the international financial institutions to ukraine , " said commission chief jose manuel barroso .
“ the agreement should also provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia , ” he said , adding that that would provide “ the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect . "
price and pay disputes between russia and ukraine have led to serious disruptions to the natural gas supply in recent years across the european union , which relies on russia for around a quarter of its gas consumption .
a payment dispute between moscow and kiev halted european gas deliveries in january , cutting off heating to thousands of homes during a cold snap .
naftogaz says ukraine has to pay a gas bill of around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- on august 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past , russia has accused ukraine of stealing gas from pipelines leading to europe politics or commerce ?
the eu has sought more transparent and commercial terms for how gas is traded between russia and ukraine .
both russia 's gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz are owned by their governments , leading to charges that the trade is more about politics than commerce .
a european commission spokesman said the deal agreed to on friday also allows for an influx of funding totaling 570 million euros from the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- in october .
one of the conditions for the loans is a recapitalization of naftogaz to the tune of two billion dollars , according to the eu commission .
a statement on the ebrd website made it clear that its funding was conditional on ukraine modernizing its energy sector , in particular naftogaz .
" our aim is to improve the sustainability , accountability and above all , the transparency of the ukrainian gas market to the benefit of both ukraine and of energy security in all of europe , " said ebrd president thomas mirow .
an imf official said ukraine would also have to increase its domestic gas prices to bring them into line with international prices. rb / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics have slammed the move as state censorship . diosdado cabello , the head of national telecommunications regulator conatel and minister of public works in president hugo chavez 's leftist government , said the decision to close the stations was part of " a new phase of information . "
cabello said the closures were due to the stations ' failures to meet legal operating requirements , and warned that more closures may follow .
he defended the closures , saying they were part of the government 's effort to " democratize the airwaves . "
but critics said the crackdown was arbitrary and the owners were not given the right to a proper defense .
the venezuelan chamber of radio broadcasters described the decision as an " enormous violation . "
freedom of expression the decision to shut down the 34 stations came one day after luisa ortega diaz , venezuela 's top prosecutor , suggested toughening the country 's media law to " regulate the freedom of expression . " it is not the first time chavez has recalled the licences of broadcasters considered critical of the government . opposition broadcaster globovision , which the president accused of " media terrorism , " has often been threatened with having its license revoked .
the broadcaster has also been slapped with hefty fines . in 2007 , chavez did not renew the license for a widely watched private tv station , rctv , that was a persistent critic of the government .
analysts believe the move is part of chavez 's payback to the media owners , who he has never forgiven for backing a failed coup against him in 2002 .

the renewed tensions come just one week ahead of the first anniversary of the war . georgia on saturday denied firing mortars at the breakaway republic of south ossetia .
south ossetia claimed two mortar rounds were fired at a military observation post from the village of ditsi on the georgian side of the de facto border . also on saturday , moscow warned georgia that its military reserved the right to use force if necessary if the former soviet state continues " provocations " in the caucasas .
georgia , russia trade accusations both sides have accused the other of shelling earlier this week in tskhinvali , the capital of the south ossetian breakaway region , which is recognized as independent by russia .
georgian interior ministry spokesman shota utiashvili , speaking to afp in tbilisi , denied any shooting had taken place .
but the russian defense ministry described the alleged georgian actions as an " attempt by the georgian leadership to inflame the situation in the region . "
utiashvili described the statement as " very worrisome " , saying russia " may be searching for a pretext " for military action against georgia .
" we hope the international community will condemn these clearly aggressive actions from the russians , " he said .
the latest tensions between georgia and russia come a week ahead of the august 7 anniversary of the five-day war between the two countries over south ossetia .
a georgian military attempt to retake south ossetia was rebuffed by russia .
moscow then sent troops and tanks deep into georgian territory .

" my goal in life , my political goal , is to unite my people , " the self-styled president , eduard kokoity , said during the interview .
" we will build our own state , which will be in alliance with russia , together with russia and i am not excluding that one day , we will be part of russia , " he said .
" the people of south ossetia want to be united with russia . "
south ossetians , who are ethnically distinct from georgians , speak their own farsi-related language and say they have been separated from their fellow people in the neighboring region of north ossetia in russia .
ninety eight percent of south ossetia 's population hold russian passports .
russian is the lingua franca and the russian ruble is the currency used .
kokoity said russia was not yet ready for unification " because this involves a very serious accusation of annexing territory . "

his comments come amid reports that western soldiers were killed by insurgents in afghanistan on saturday . officials say three us troops and one french soldier were killed in separate attacks in afghanistan on saturday .
the americans were killed in roadside bomb blasts in kandahar province and the french soldier was killed in a gun battle north of the capital , kabul .
the latest deaths in afghanistan come after comments by the new head of nato and former danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen that he would be willing to talk with moderate sections of the taliban to try and win the war there .
barely hours after taking over the reins at nato on aug 1 , rasmussen told the danish newspaper politiken that he favors setting up negotiations with the radical islamist taliban in afghanistan .
however , he emphasized that such a dialogue was only possible with certain sections of the taliban .
" there is certainly a hard core that is impossible to reach any deals with .
they have only respect for military powers , " he told the newspaper , " i certainly do n't know why one should strike any agreements with those who are killing our soldiers . " but he said he would support dialogue with " moderate groups on the outer reaches of the taliban . " and added , " we obviously want to co-operate with those who want to contribute to a safer situation in afghanistan and to create a framework for reconstruction and economic and social development . " rising casualties and low morale the conflict in afghanistan is the largest military campaign in nato 's history .
it 's also the bloodiest , with over 1,000 western troops killed since the alliance began operations in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nato countries are doubting the afghan mission as casulties add up there are around 90,000 international troops under the nato military alliance and us-led coalition command in afghanistan , fighting alongside afghan forces against the taliban and other radical groups . but the insurgency against the western-backed afghan government has steadily worsened despite a growing international presence . rasmussen will have to try to persuade reluctant european allies to commit more troops , money and other resources to afghanistan at a time when opinion polls show public support for the war waning as casualties grow . many nato members have begun to lose faith in the mission , and one by one they have begun making plans to pull out their troops . the dutch are expected to recall their soldiers from afghanistan next year , and canada is debating a 2011 pull-out .
meanwhile , great britain 's role in the conflict has come under fire at home after 22 soldiers were killed during fighting last month alone. mrm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new report out this week says rainy weather , smoking bans and higher prices have put a real dent in beer sales in germany this year . new data released this week by the federal statistics office showed that sales of beer from january to june dropped to their lowest level since the office began keeping track of the numbers back in 1991 .
german breweries sold 49,3 million hectoliters -lrb- 1.1 billion gallons -rrb- of beer in the first half of the year .
that 's down 4.5 percent on the same period last year .
" in addition to the weather conditions , the current increases in beer prices and the ban on smoking in restaurants and so on had an essential impact on the trend in beer sales , " the statistics office said .
breweries across the country say they do n't dare raise prices in an attempt to make up for the lost revenue for fear of ruining sales .
michael weiss , vice president of the federation of german brewers , told german news agency dpa that it was the worst decline in the industry 's modern history .
the czech republic overtook germany in per-capita beer consumption years ago .
the veltins brewery said german beer consumption declined more than five percent in annual terms in the first half of the year , with higher-priced brands like its own worst affected .
among the premium german brands , veltins , warsteiner , bitburger and jever reported slumps ranging from 4.6 to 7 per cent .
veltins did not expect any revival till 2012 .
beer sales have been sliding for years .
beer has gradually fallen out of fashion in germany as people switch to healthy drinks or to other alcoholic beverages such as wine. mrm / dpa / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2009 loan deal agreed for ukraine gas bills großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dispute between moscow and kiev hit homes and businesses in europe in january the european commission says ukraine has reached a deal with international financial bodies and the eu for payment of russian gas bills .
the agreement is expected to allay fears in europe of a supply cutoff . the deal , which will allow kiev to restock its gas reservoirs , will see the international monetary fund releasing a third tranche worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- from a credit line worth more than 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.4 billion -rrb- over a period of two years .
" i 'm extremely pleased that political agreement has been reached with ukraine on reform of its gas sector , which opens the way for a financial assistance package to be provided by the international financial institutions to ukraine , " said commission chief jose manuel barroso .
“ the agreement should also provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia , ” he said , adding that that would provide “ the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect . "
price and pay disputes between russia and ukraine have led to serious disruptions to the natural gas supply in recent years across the european union , which relies on russia for around a quarter of its gas consumption .
a payment dispute between moscow and kiev halted european gas deliveries in january , cutting off heating to thousands of homes during a cold snap .
naftogaz says ukraine has to pay a gas bill of around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- on august 7 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past , russia has accused ukraine of stealing gas from pipelines leading to europe politics or commerce ?
the eu has sought more transparent and commercial terms for how gas is traded between russia and ukraine .
both russia 's gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz are owned by their governments , leading to charges that the trade is more about politics than commerce .
a european commission spokesman said the deal agreed to on friday also allows for an influx of funding totaling 570 million euros from the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- in october .
one of the conditions for the loans is a recapitalization of naftogaz to the tune of two billion dollars , according to the eu commission .
a statement on the ebrd website made it clear that its funding was conditional on ukraine modernizing its energy sector , in particular naftogaz .
" our aim is to improve the sustainability , accountability and above all , the transparency of the ukrainian gas market to the benefit of both ukraine and of energy security in all of europe , " said ebrd president thomas mirow .
an imf official said ukraine would also have to increase its domestic gas prices to bring them into line with international prices. rb / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

loans worth $ 1.7bn -lrb- £ 1bn -rrb- were agreed in return for reforms to ukraine 's gas sector , the european commission said .
the deal is meant to include money to help ukrainian national gas company naftogaz pay off large debts to russia .
in january , many countries were left without gas because of a payment dispute between moscow and kiev .
the new deal will allow ukraine to replenish its reserves of russian gas before the winter .
commission president jose manuel barroso said ukraine had made commitments which would ensure increased transparency and the long-term viability of the industry , though he did not give details .
" the agreement should provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia and therefore provide the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect , " he said .
the institutions that will provide funding include the international monetary fund , the world bank , and the european bank for reconstruction and development .
lenders have called for naftogaz to end subsidies of gas supplies within ukraine as a condition for making loans , correspondents say .
russia provides about a quarter of the gas consumed in the eu and 80 % of that is piped through ukraine .

loans worth $ 1.7bn -lrb- £ 1bn -rrb- were agreed in return for reforms to ukraine 's gas sector , the european commission said .
the deal is meant to include money to help ukrainian national gas company naftogaz pay off large debts to russia .
in january , many countries were left without gas because of a payment dispute between moscow and kiev .
the new deal will allow ukraine to replenish its reserves of russian gas before the winter .
commission president jose manuel barroso said ukraine had made commitments which would ensure increased transparency and the long-term viability of the industry , though he did not give details .
" the agreement should provide the stability needed to significantly reduce the risk of a further gas crisis between ukraine and russia and therefore provide the security of supply that member states and our consumers expect , " he said .
the institutions that will provide funding include the international monetary fund , the world bank , and the european bank for reconstruction and development .
lenders have called for naftogaz to end subsidies of gas supplies within ukraine as a condition for making loans , correspondents say .
russia provides about a quarter of the gas consumed in the eu and 80 % of that is piped through ukraine .
