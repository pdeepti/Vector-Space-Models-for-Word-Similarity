26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .

steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .
german carmakers including volkswagen , bmw and daimler , the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz cars have already cut production and placed employees on reduced working hours as they face up to the global economic slowdown. nda / th -lrb- dpa / afp / rtrs -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .

echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .

opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .

however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .

but his successor milan milutinovic has walked out of the courtroom a free man . the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague has convicted five former high-ranking yugoslav and serbian political , military and police officials for crimes against humanity committed in kosovo in 1999 .
all of the men were given sentences of between 15 and 22 years but milan milutinovic , the former president of serbia , was acquitted of all charges , according to a icty press release .
milutinovic was elected in 1997 , succeeding slobodan milosevic .
the chamber said the prosecution had not proven that milutinovic had actual control over yugoslav army -lrb- vj -rrb- and interior ministry police forces -lrb- mup -rrb- forces in kosovo .
" in practice , it was milosevic , sometimes termed the ' supreme commander , ' who exercised actual command authority over the vj during the nato campaign , " said icty 's presiding judge iain bonomy on thursday , feb .
26 .
milosevic died in a cell of the icty tribunal in march 2006 , where he was being tried for war crimes .
long prison terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court did find that war crimes were committed in kosovo former yugoslav deputy prime minister nikola sainovic , vj general nebojsa pavkovic and serbian police general sreten lukic were each sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment for crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war .
vj general vladimir lazarevic and chief of the general staff dragoljub ojdanic were found guilty of aiding and abetting the deportation and forcible transfer of the ethnic albanian population of kosovo .
they were each sentenced to 15 years ' imprisonment .
the prosecution had charged the six defendants with crimes committed during a campaign of terror and violence directed against the ethnic albanian population of kosovo in early 1999 .
its aim was to amend the ethnic structure in kosovo to ensure continued control by serbian authorities .
" the plan was to be executed by criminal means , including deportations , murders , forcible transfers and persecutions of kosovo albanians , " the court said in a statement .
violence against kosovo albanians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court convicted five other high-ranking serb officials the court said that there had been a broad campaign of violence directed against the kosovo albanian civilian population during the course of nato airstrikes in the federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- that began on march 24 , 1999 .
this campaign was conducted by army and mup forces under the control of fry and serbian authorities .
they were " responsible for mass expulsions of kosovo albanian civilians from their homes , as well as incidents of killing , sexual assault , and the intentional destruction of mosques , " the court said .
" it was the deliberate actions of these forces during this campaign that caused the departure of at least 700,000 kosovo albanians from kosovo in the short period of time between the end of march and beginning of june 1999 , " bonomy said .
the judgment is the first handed down by the tribunal for crimes committed by fry and serbian forces against kosovo albanians during the 1999 conflict in kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february of 2008 .
the declaration has been recognized by the united states and many european countries , but not by serbia . serbs unhappy with decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic died before his war crimes trial came to an end serbia 's socialist party said it is unhappy with the convictions .
" in the softest possible terms , this is an unjust verdict , " said djordje milicevic , the spokesman of the party which forms a key part of serbia 's ruling coalition government .
" those who defended their country and their people against aggression were convicted , " milicevic was quoted as telling beta news agency .
milicevic made no comment about the acquittal , but said he expected the convictions to be overturned on appeal. sac / th -lrb- dpa / ap / reuters / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

but his successor milan milutinovic has walked out of the courtroom a free man . the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague has convicted five former high-ranking yugoslav and serbian political , military and police officials for crimes against humanity committed in kosovo in 1999 .
all of the men were given sentences of between 15 and 22 years but milan milutinovic , the former president of serbia , was acquitted of all charges , according to a icty press release .
milutinovic was elected in 1997 , succeeding slobodan milosevic .
the chamber said the prosecution had not proven that milutinovic had actual control over yugoslav army -lrb- vj -rrb- and interior ministry police forces -lrb- mup -rrb- forces in kosovo .
" in practice , it was milosevic , sometimes termed the ' supreme commander , ' who exercised actual command authority over the vj during the nato campaign , " said icty 's presiding judge iain bonomy on thursday , feb .
26 .
milosevic died in a cell of the icty tribunal in march 2006 , where he was being tried for war crimes .
long prison terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court did find that war crimes were committed in kosovo former yugoslav deputy prime minister nikola sainovic , vj general nebojsa pavkovic and serbian police general sreten lukic were each sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment for crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war .
vj general vladimir lazarevic and chief of the general staff dragoljub ojdanic were found guilty of aiding and abetting the deportation and forcible transfer of the ethnic albanian population of kosovo .
they were each sentenced to 15 years ' imprisonment .
the prosecution had charged the six defendants with crimes committed during a campaign of terror and violence directed against the ethnic albanian population of kosovo in early 1999 .
its aim was to amend the ethnic structure in kosovo to ensure continued control by serbian authorities .
" the plan was to be executed by criminal means , including deportations , murders , forcible transfers and persecutions of kosovo albanians , " the court said in a statement .
violence against kosovo albanians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court convicted five other high-ranking serb officials the court said that there had been a broad campaign of violence directed against the kosovo albanian civilian population during the course of nato airstrikes in the federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- that began on march 24 , 1999 .
this campaign was conducted by army and mup forces under the control of fry and serbian authorities .
they were " responsible for mass expulsions of kosovo albanian civilians from their homes , as well as incidents of killing , sexual assault , and the intentional destruction of mosques , " the court said .
" it was the deliberate actions of these forces during this campaign that caused the departure of at least 700,000 kosovo albanians from kosovo in the short period of time between the end of march and beginning of june 1999 , " bonomy said .
the judgment is the first handed down by the tribunal for crimes committed by fry and serbian forces against kosovo albanians during the 1999 conflict in kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february of 2008 .
the declaration has been recognized by the united states and many european countries , but not by serbia . serbs unhappy with decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic died before his war crimes trial came to an end serbia 's socialist party said it is unhappy with the convictions .
" in the softest possible terms , this is an unjust verdict , " said djordje milicevic , the spokesman of the party which forms a key part of serbia 's ruling coalition government .
" those who defended their country and their people against aggression were convicted , " milicevic was quoted as telling beta news agency .
milicevic made no comment about the acquittal , but said he expected the convictions to be overturned on appeal. sac / th -lrb- dpa / ap / reuters / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have no interest in the collapse of the us car industry , but what happens there to help them must follow international rules , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said on wednesday , feb .
25 .
" we will not hesitate to take the necessary steps if that should not happen . " the brussels-based executive will make sure that national governments stick to the rules on fair competition " both inside and outside the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market , " he stressed . us automakers gm and chrysler have already received $ 17.4 billion -lrb- 13.7 billion euros -rrb- in emergency government loans , but said on feb .
17 that they would need nearly $ 10 billion in additional federal aid over the coming months if they were to turn the corner . on the same day , gm said that it would sell its swedish-based subsidiary , saab , and could do the same with german subsidiary opel .
saab filed for bankruptcy protection three days later , while opel has asked the german government for an estimated 3.3 billion euros in loan guarantees . gm to blame for opel 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bungling at us headquarters has wrought bad times in germany verheugen said the commission intended to protect gm 's european subsidiaries , adding , " we do not believe that you can solve the overcapacity problem by throwing the weakest people off the sledge . " but he also stressed that any aid to opel would have to be accompanied by thorough restructuring plans , placing the blame for the situation squarely on gm . " the problems do not simply stem from the sales crisis , they are the result of years of management failure in the -lrb- gm -rrb- headquarters in detroit , " he said .
" the european tax-payer can not foot the bill for it just like that . " thousands of opel employees had gathered to demonstrate on thursday , to call for the german company to become independent of its troubled american parent .
opel is also expected to unveil a new business plan this week amidst speculation that it might look for government support , perhaps even combined with independence from gm . lobby wants to increase demand for cars the car industry accounts for some 12 million jobs across europe , but it has been especially hard hit by the global economic crash , with new passenger car registrations in january slumping by 27 percent compared with the same month last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new-car registrations plummeted sharply in january on wednesday , the european car manufacturers ' umbrella group , acea , called on the eu to protect the industry by allowing state lending support , boosting funding by the european investment bank and bringing in measures to encourage consumers to buy new cars . france , italy , spain , britain , germany and sweden have all launched plans in recent days to support domestic car makers . strings being attached concerns have , however , arisen over clauses such as a french condition that any company that receives state aid should promise not to close its factories in france . such a clause would break the eu 's rules on the free movement of companies , and could force the closure of french-owned factories in other eu member states , commission officials have warned . " you ca n't be a believer in the single market for car sales and on the other hand say ' i 'm not a believer in the single market for production ' , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . on tuesday , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his policy , saying he had been forced to launch it because the eu had failed to approve a europe-wide support scheme . but a report in wednesday 's edition of french daily le figaro suggested that paris was prepared to back down on the clause . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 26.02.2009 berlin politician reignites debate on npd ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians would ultimately like to see the npd banned berlin 's interior minister has disclosed restricted information on undercover infiltration of the far-right npd .
his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .
he joined the npd in 2000. sac / th -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .

this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .
he joined the npd in 2000. sac / th -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bavarians blew away sporting lisbon 5-0 . the german champions made history with the widest ever away victory margin in the champions league by trouncing sporting lisbon 5-0 . bayern , who went into the game on the back of a miserable start to the second half of the bundesliga side and lost 2-1 at home to cologne on the weekend , started much stronger in lisbon . sporting are the only team left in the champions league who have never reached the competition 's quarter-finals and the thumping they received at home has likely put that goal out of reach this season as well . ribery sublime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich were caught flat-footed by cologne in the bundesliga although bayern still had problems creating chances in the first half , the defense stood tall , and , somewhat against the run of play , franck ribery gave the visitors the lead three minutes from the break after claiming the ball close to the center line . the french international ran through the sporting half , evaded two markers and waved away italian striker luca toni , opting to shoot himself , and he made no mistake , slotting past sporting goalkeeper tiago . bayern added a second in the 57th minute when germany striker miroslav klose stole past his marker and pushed a long cross from massimo oddo over the goal line .
as toni just touched the ball with his head before it came to klose , the scorer was in an offside position , but referee bertrand layec gave the goal . worse was to follow for sporting as fabio rochemback brought down germany defender philipp lahm in the area just five minutes later , and ribery made no mistake from the spot to make it 3-0 . problems at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said there is still plenty of room to improve for bayern late in the game , toni added two more with ribery providing the assists in both cases to totally humiliate the home side . bayern coach juergen klinsmann said that even though he was proud of his side , they needed to concentrate on their next game . " i am hopeful that this has given the side a boost ahead of our next game in the bundesliga , " he said .
" i am confident that the players will not get carried away by this result .
the team can be proud of their game in lisbon , but we now need to concentrate on the bundesliga . " bayern captain mark van bommel also that the victory was great but means little if they do n't follow it up with a good game in the bundesliga . " after the win , there was no euphoria amongst the players in the change rooms , " he said .

the bavarians blew away sporting lisbon 5-0 . the german champions made history with the widest ever away victory margin in the champions league by trouncing sporting lisbon 5-0 . bayern , who went into the game on the back of a miserable start to the second half of the bundesliga side and lost 2-1 at home to cologne on the weekend , started much stronger in lisbon . sporting are the only team left in the champions league who have never reached the competition 's quarter-finals and the thumping they received at home has likely put that goal out of reach this season as well . ribery sublime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich were caught flat-footed by cologne in the bundesliga although bayern still had problems creating chances in the first half , the defense stood tall , and , somewhat against the run of play , franck ribery gave the visitors the lead three minutes from the break after claiming the ball close to the center line . the french international ran through the sporting half , evaded two markers and waved away italian striker luca toni , opting to shoot himself , and he made no mistake , slotting past sporting goalkeeper tiago . bayern added a second in the 57th minute when germany striker miroslav klose stole past his marker and pushed a long cross from massimo oddo over the goal line .
as toni just touched the ball with his head before it came to klose , the scorer was in an offside position , but referee bertrand layec gave the goal . worse was to follow for sporting as fabio rochemback brought down germany defender philipp lahm in the area just five minutes later , and ribery made no mistake from the spot to make it 3-0 . problems at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said there is still plenty of room to improve for bayern late in the game , toni added two more with ribery providing the assists in both cases to totally humiliate the home side . bayern coach juergen klinsmann said that even though he was proud of his side , they needed to concentrate on their next game . " i am hopeful that this has given the side a boost ahead of our next game in the bundesliga , " he said .
" i am confident that the players will not get carried away by this result .
the team can be proud of their game in lisbon , but we now need to concentrate on the bundesliga . " bayern captain mark van bommel also that the victory was great but means little if they do n't follow it up with a good game in the bundesliga . " after the win , there was no euphoria amongst the players in the change rooms , " he said .
" on sunday we have an important bundesliga match , and we are looking towards that .
we played a good game and made it very difficult for them to get through . " author : sean sinico -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bavarians blew away sporting lisbon 5-0 . the german champions made history with the widest ever away victory margin in the champions league by trouncing sporting lisbon 5-0 . bayern , who went into the game on the back of a miserable start to the second half of the bundesliga side and lost 2-1 at home to cologne on the weekend , started much stronger in lisbon . sporting are the only team left in the champions league who have never reached the competition 's quarter-finals and the thumping they received at home has likely put that goal out of reach this season as well . ribery sublime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich were caught flat-footed by cologne in the bundesliga although bayern still had problems creating chances in the first half , the defense stood tall , and , somewhat against the run of play , franck ribery gave the visitors the lead three minutes from the break after claiming the ball close to the center line . the french international ran through the sporting half , evaded two markers and waved away italian striker luca toni , opting to shoot himself , and he made no mistake , slotting past sporting goalkeeper tiago . bayern added a second in the 57th minute when germany striker miroslav klose stole past his marker and pushed a long cross from massimo oddo over the goal line .
as toni just touched the ball with his head before it came to klose , the scorer was in an offside position , but referee bertrand layec gave the goal . worse was to follow for sporting as fabio rochemback brought down germany defender philipp lahm in the area just five minutes later , and ribery made no mistake from the spot to make it 3-0 . problems at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said there is still plenty of room to improve for bayern late in the game , toni added two more with ribery providing the assists in both cases to totally humiliate the home side . bayern coach juergen klinsmann said that even though he was proud of his side , they needed to concentrate on their next game . " i am hopeful that this has given the side a boost ahead of our next game in the bundesliga , " he said .
" i am confident that the players will not get carried away by this result .
the team can be proud of their game in lisbon , but we now need to concentrate on the bundesliga . " bayern captain mark van bommel also that the victory was great but means little if they do n't follow it up with a good game in the bundesliga . " after the win , there was no euphoria amongst the players in the change rooms , " he said .

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .
german carmakers including volkswagen , bmw and daimler , the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz cars have already cut production and placed employees on reduced working hours as they face up to the global economic slowdown. nda / th -lrb- dpa / afp / rtrs -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .

the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "

some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 26.02.2009 berlin politician reignites debate on npd ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians would ultimately like to see the npd banned berlin 's interior minister has disclosed restricted information on undercover infiltration of the far-right npd .
his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .
he joined the npd in 2000. sac / th -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but his successor milan milutinovic has walked out of the courtroom a free man . the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague has convicted five former high-ranking yugoslav and serbian political , military and police officials for crimes against humanity committed in kosovo in 1999 .
all of the men were given sentences of between 15 and 22 years but milan milutinovic , the former president of serbia , was acquitted of all charges , according to a icty press release .
milutinovic was elected in 1997 , succeeding slobodan milosevic .
the chamber said the prosecution had not proven that milutinovic had actual control over yugoslav army -lrb- vj -rrb- and interior ministry police forces -lrb- mup -rrb- forces in kosovo .
" in practice , it was milosevic , sometimes termed the ' supreme commander , ' who exercised actual command authority over the vj during the nato campaign , " said icty 's presiding judge iain bonomy on thursday , feb .
26 .
milosevic died in a cell of the icty tribunal in march 2006 , where he was being tried for war crimes .
long prison terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court did find that war crimes were committed in kosovo former yugoslav deputy prime minister nikola sainovic , vj general nebojsa pavkovic and serbian police general sreten lukic were each sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment for crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war .
vj general vladimir lazarevic and chief of the general staff dragoljub ojdanic were found guilty of aiding and abetting the deportation and forcible transfer of the ethnic albanian population of kosovo .
they were each sentenced to 15 years ' imprisonment .
the prosecution had charged the six defendants with crimes committed during a campaign of terror and violence directed against the ethnic albanian population of kosovo in early 1999 .
its aim was to amend the ethnic structure in kosovo to ensure continued control by serbian authorities .
" the plan was to be executed by criminal means , including deportations , murders , forcible transfers and persecutions of kosovo albanians , " the court said in a statement .
violence against kosovo albanians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court convicted five other high-ranking serb officials the court said that there had been a broad campaign of violence directed against the kosovo albanian civilian population during the course of nato airstrikes in the federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- that began on march 24 , 1999 .
this campaign was conducted by army and mup forces under the control of fry and serbian authorities .
they were " responsible for mass expulsions of kosovo albanian civilians from their homes , as well as incidents of killing , sexual assault , and the intentional destruction of mosques , " the court said .
" it was the deliberate actions of these forces during this campaign that caused the departure of at least 700,000 kosovo albanians from kosovo in the short period of time between the end of march and beginning of june 1999 , " bonomy said .
the judgment is the first handed down by the tribunal for crimes committed by fry and serbian forces against kosovo albanians during the 1999 conflict in kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february of 2008 .
the declaration has been recognized by the united states and many european countries , but not by serbia . serbs unhappy with decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic died before his war crimes trial came to an end serbia 's socialist party said it is unhappy with the convictions .
" in the softest possible terms , this is an unjust verdict , " said djordje milicevic , the spokesman of the party which forms a key part of serbia 's ruling coalition government .
" those who defended their country and their people against aggression were convicted , " milicevic was quoted as telling beta news agency .
milicevic made no comment about the acquittal , but said he expected the convictions to be overturned on appeal. sac / th -lrb- dpa / ap / reuters / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bavarians blew away sporting lisbon 5-0 . the german champions made history with the widest ever away victory margin in the champions league by trouncing sporting lisbon 5-0 . bayern , who went into the game on the back of a miserable start to the second half of the bundesliga side and lost 2-1 at home to cologne on the weekend , started much stronger in lisbon . sporting are the only team left in the champions league who have never reached the competition 's quarter-finals and the thumping they received at home has likely put that goal out of reach this season as well . ribery sublime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich were caught flat-footed by cologne in the bundesliga although bayern still had problems creating chances in the first half , the defense stood tall , and , somewhat against the run of play , franck ribery gave the visitors the lead three minutes from the break after claiming the ball close to the center line . the french international ran through the sporting half , evaded two markers and waved away italian striker luca toni , opting to shoot himself , and he made no mistake , slotting past sporting goalkeeper tiago . bayern added a second in the 57th minute when germany striker miroslav klose stole past his marker and pushed a long cross from massimo oddo over the goal line .
as toni just touched the ball with his head before it came to klose , the scorer was in an offside position , but referee bertrand layec gave the goal . worse was to follow for sporting as fabio rochemback brought down germany defender philipp lahm in the area just five minutes later , and ribery made no mistake from the spot to make it 3-0 . problems at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said there is still plenty of room to improve for bayern late in the game , toni added two more with ribery providing the assists in both cases to totally humiliate the home side . bayern coach juergen klinsmann said that even though he was proud of his side , they needed to concentrate on their next game . " i am hopeful that this has given the side a boost ahead of our next game in the bundesliga , " he said .
" i am confident that the players will not get carried away by this result .
the team can be proud of their game in lisbon , but we now need to concentrate on the bundesliga . " bayern captain mark van bommel also that the victory was great but means little if they do n't follow it up with a good game in the bundesliga . " after the win , there was no euphoria amongst the players in the change rooms , " he said .
" on sunday we have an important bundesliga match , and we are looking towards that .
we played a good game and made it very difficult for them to get through . " author : sean sinico -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.02.2009 spotlight berlin : illegal immigrants and the health care dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no sure way to know how many people live in germany illegally berlin may introduce an " anonymous insurance certificate " to allow illegal residents to see a doctor without legal repercussions .
deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 26.02.2009 berlin politician reignites debate on npd ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians would ultimately like to see the npd banned berlin 's interior minister has disclosed restricted information on undercover infiltration of the far-right npd .
his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .
he joined the npd in 2000. sac / th -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but his successor milan milutinovic has walked out of the courtroom a free man . the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague has convicted five former high-ranking yugoslav and serbian political , military and police officials for crimes against humanity committed in kosovo in 1999 .
all of the men were given sentences of between 15 and 22 years but milan milutinovic , the former president of serbia , was acquitted of all charges , according to a icty press release .
milutinovic was elected in 1997 , succeeding slobodan milosevic .
the chamber said the prosecution had not proven that milutinovic had actual control over yugoslav army -lrb- vj -rrb- and interior ministry police forces -lrb- mup -rrb- forces in kosovo .
" in practice , it was milosevic , sometimes termed the ' supreme commander , ' who exercised actual command authority over the vj during the nato campaign , " said icty 's presiding judge iain bonomy on thursday , feb .
26 .
milosevic died in a cell of the icty tribunal in march 2006 , where he was being tried for war crimes .
long prison terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court did find that war crimes were committed in kosovo former yugoslav deputy prime minister nikola sainovic , vj general nebojsa pavkovic and serbian police general sreten lukic were each sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment for crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war .
vj general vladimir lazarevic and chief of the general staff dragoljub ojdanic were found guilty of aiding and abetting the deportation and forcible transfer of the ethnic albanian population of kosovo .
they were each sentenced to 15 years ' imprisonment .
the prosecution had charged the six defendants with crimes committed during a campaign of terror and violence directed against the ethnic albanian population of kosovo in early 1999 .
its aim was to amend the ethnic structure in kosovo to ensure continued control by serbian authorities .
" the plan was to be executed by criminal means , including deportations , murders , forcible transfers and persecutions of kosovo albanians , " the court said in a statement .
violence against kosovo albanians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court convicted five other high-ranking serb officials the court said that there had been a broad campaign of violence directed against the kosovo albanian civilian population during the course of nato airstrikes in the federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- that began on march 24 , 1999 .
this campaign was conducted by army and mup forces under the control of fry and serbian authorities .
they were " responsible for mass expulsions of kosovo albanian civilians from their homes , as well as incidents of killing , sexual assault , and the intentional destruction of mosques , " the court said .
" it was the deliberate actions of these forces during this campaign that caused the departure of at least 700,000 kosovo albanians from kosovo in the short period of time between the end of march and beginning of june 1999 , " bonomy said .
the judgment is the first handed down by the tribunal for crimes committed by fry and serbian forces against kosovo albanians during the 1999 conflict in kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february of 2008 .
the declaration has been recognized by the united states and many european countries , but not by serbia . serbs unhappy with decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic died before his war crimes trial came to an end serbia 's socialist party said it is unhappy with the convictions .

" those who defended their country and their people against aggression were convicted , " milicevic was quoted as telling beta news agency .

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .

but his successor milan milutinovic has walked out of the courtroom a free man . the united nations international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague has convicted five former high-ranking yugoslav and serbian political , military and police officials for crimes against humanity committed in kosovo in 1999 .
all of the men were given sentences of between 15 and 22 years but milan milutinovic , the former president of serbia , was acquitted of all charges , according to a icty press release .
milutinovic was elected in 1997 , succeeding slobodan milosevic .
the chamber said the prosecution had not proven that milutinovic had actual control over yugoslav army -lrb- vj -rrb- and interior ministry police forces -lrb- mup -rrb- forces in kosovo .
" in practice , it was milosevic , sometimes termed the ' supreme commander , ' who exercised actual command authority over the vj during the nato campaign , " said icty 's presiding judge iain bonomy on thursday , feb .
26 .
milosevic died in a cell of the icty tribunal in march 2006 , where he was being tried for war crimes .
long prison terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court did find that war crimes were committed in kosovo former yugoslav deputy prime minister nikola sainovic , vj general nebojsa pavkovic and serbian police general sreten lukic were each sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment for crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war .
vj general vladimir lazarevic and chief of the general staff dragoljub ojdanic were found guilty of aiding and abetting the deportation and forcible transfer of the ethnic albanian population of kosovo .
they were each sentenced to 15 years ' imprisonment .
the prosecution had charged the six defendants with crimes committed during a campaign of terror and violence directed against the ethnic albanian population of kosovo in early 1999 .
its aim was to amend the ethnic structure in kosovo to ensure continued control by serbian authorities .
" the plan was to be executed by criminal means , including deportations , murders , forcible transfers and persecutions of kosovo albanians , " the court said in a statement .
violence against kosovo albanians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court convicted five other high-ranking serb officials the court said that there had been a broad campaign of violence directed against the kosovo albanian civilian population during the course of nato airstrikes in the federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- that began on march 24 , 1999 .
this campaign was conducted by army and mup forces under the control of fry and serbian authorities .
they were " responsible for mass expulsions of kosovo albanian civilians from their homes , as well as incidents of killing , sexual assault , and the intentional destruction of mosques , " the court said .
" it was the deliberate actions of these forces during this campaign that caused the departure of at least 700,000 kosovo albanians from kosovo in the short period of time between the end of march and beginning of june 1999 , " bonomy said .
the judgment is the first handed down by the tribunal for crimes committed by fry and serbian forces against kosovo albanians during the 1999 conflict in kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february of 2008 .
the declaration has been recognized by the united states and many european countries , but not by serbia . serbs unhappy with decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic died before his war crimes trial came to an end serbia 's socialist party said it is unhappy with the convictions .
" in the softest possible terms , this is an unjust verdict , " said djordje milicevic , the spokesman of the party which forms a key part of serbia 's ruling coalition government .
" those who defended their country and their people against aggression were convicted , " milicevic was quoted as telling beta news agency .
milicevic made no comment about the acquittal , but said he expected the convictions to be overturned on appeal. sac / th -lrb- dpa / ap / reuters / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.02.2009 thousands demonstrate to save jobs at crisis-hit opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not the first time opel workers have taken to the streets ; 2004 also saw demonstrations auto manufacturer opel is fighting to survive after being plunged into crisis by struggling parent us giant general motors .
now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .

the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .

his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .

his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .
german carmakers including volkswagen , bmw and daimler , the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz cars have already cut production and placed employees on reduced working hours as they face up to the global economic slowdown. nda / th -lrb- dpa / afp / rtrs -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de thousands demonstrate to save jobs at crisis-hit opel auto manufacturer opel is fighting to survive after being plunged into crisis by struggling parent us giant general motors .
now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs .

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .
german carmakers including volkswagen , bmw and daimler , the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz cars have already cut production and placed employees on reduced working hours as they face up to the global economic slowdown. nda / th -lrb- dpa / afp / rtrs -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all of the men were given sentences of between 15 and 22 years but milan milutinovic , the former president of serbia , was acquitted of all charges , according to a icty press release .
milutinovic was elected in 1997 , succeeding slobodan milosevic .
the chamber said the prosecution had not proven that milutinovic had actual control over yugoslav army -lrb- vj -rrb- and interior ministry police forces -lrb- mup -rrb- forces in kosovo .
" in practice , it was milosevic , sometimes termed the ' supreme commander , ' who exercised actual command authority over the vj during the nato campaign , " said icty 's presiding judge iain bonomy on thursday , feb .
26 .
milosevic died in a cell of the icty tribunal in march 2006 , where he was being tried for war crimes .
long prison terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court did find that war crimes were committed in kosovo former yugoslav deputy prime minister nikola sainovic , vj general nebojsa pavkovic and serbian police general sreten lukic were each sentenced to 22 years of imprisonment for crimes against humanity and violation of the laws or customs of war .
vj general vladimir lazarevic and chief of the general staff dragoljub ojdanic were found guilty of aiding and abetting the deportation and forcible transfer of the ethnic albanian population of kosovo .
they were each sentenced to 15 years ' imprisonment .
the prosecution had charged the six defendants with crimes committed during a campaign of terror and violence directed against the ethnic albanian population of kosovo in early 1999 .
its aim was to amend the ethnic structure in kosovo to ensure continued control by serbian authorities .
" the plan was to be executed by criminal means , including deportations , murders , forcible transfers and persecutions of kosovo albanians , " the court said in a statement .
violence against kosovo albanians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court convicted five other high-ranking serb officials the court said that there had been a broad campaign of violence directed against the kosovo albanian civilian population during the course of nato airstrikes in the federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- that began on march 24 , 1999 .
this campaign was conducted by army and mup forces under the control of fry and serbian authorities .
they were " responsible for mass expulsions of kosovo albanian civilians from their homes , as well as incidents of killing , sexual assault , and the intentional destruction of mosques , " the court said .
" it was the deliberate actions of these forces during this campaign that caused the departure of at least 700,000 kosovo albanians from kosovo in the short period of time between the end of march and beginning of june 1999 , " bonomy said .
the judgment is the first handed down by the tribunal for crimes committed by fry and serbian forces against kosovo albanians during the 1999 conflict in kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february of 2008 .
the declaration has been recognized by the united states and many european countries , but not by serbia . serbs unhappy with decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic died before his war crimes trial came to an end serbia 's socialist party said it is unhappy with the convictions .
" in the softest possible terms , this is an unjust verdict , " said djordje milicevic , the spokesman of the party which forms a key part of serbia 's ruling coalition government .
" those who defended their country and their people against aggression were convicted , " milicevic was quoted as telling beta news agency .
milicevic made no comment about the acquittal , but said he expected the convictions to be overturned on appeal. sac / th -lrb- dpa / ap / reuters / afp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 26.02.2009 berlin politician reignites debate on npd ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians would ultimately like to see the npd banned berlin 's interior minister has disclosed restricted information on undercover infiltration of the far-right npd .
his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .

his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .

his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bavarians blew away sporting lisbon 5-0 . the german champions made history with the widest ever away victory margin in the champions league by trouncing sporting lisbon 5-0 . bayern , who went into the game on the back of a miserable start to the second half of the bundesliga side and lost 2-1 at home to cologne on the weekend , started much stronger in lisbon . sporting are the only team left in the champions league who have never reached the competition 's quarter-finals and the thumping they received at home has likely put that goal out of reach this season as well . ribery sublime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich were caught flat-footed by cologne in the bundesliga although bayern still had problems creating chances in the first half , the defense stood tall , and , somewhat against the run of play , franck ribery gave the visitors the lead three minutes from the break after claiming the ball close to the center line . the french international ran through the sporting half , evaded two markers and waved away italian striker luca toni , opting to shoot himself , and he made no mistake , slotting past sporting goalkeeper tiago . bayern added a second in the 57th minute when germany striker miroslav klose stole past his marker and pushed a long cross from massimo oddo over the goal line .
as toni just touched the ball with his head before it came to klose , the scorer was in an offside position , but referee bertrand layec gave the goal . worse was to follow for sporting as fabio rochemback brought down germany defender philipp lahm in the area just five minutes later , and ribery made no mistake from the spot to make it 3-0 . problems at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said there is still plenty of room to improve for bayern late in the game , toni added two more with ribery providing the assists in both cases to totally humiliate the home side . bayern coach juergen klinsmann said that even though he was proud of his side , they needed to concentrate on their next game . " i am hopeful that this has given the side a boost ahead of our next game in the bundesliga , " he said .
" i am confident that the players will not get carried away by this result .
the team can be proud of their game in lisbon , but we now need to concentrate on the bundesliga . " bayern captain mark van bommel also that the victory was great but means little if they do n't follow it up with a good game in the bundesliga . " after the win , there was no euphoria amongst the players in the change rooms , " he said .
" on sunday we have an important bundesliga match , and we are looking towards that .
we played a good game and made it very difficult for them to get through . " author : sean sinico -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.02.2009 spotlight berlin : illegal immigrants and the health care dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no sure way to know how many people live in germany illegally berlin may introduce an " anonymous insurance certificate " to allow illegal residents to see a doctor without legal repercussions .
deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .

the bavarians blew away sporting lisbon 5-0 . the german champions made history with the widest ever away victory margin in the champions league by trouncing sporting lisbon 5-0 . bayern , who went into the game on the back of a miserable start to the second half of the bundesliga side and lost 2-1 at home to cologne on the weekend , started much stronger in lisbon . sporting are the only team left in the champions league who have never reached the competition 's quarter-finals and the thumping they received at home has likely put that goal out of reach this season as well . ribery sublime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich were caught flat-footed by cologne in the bundesliga although bayern still had problems creating chances in the first half , the defense stood tall , and , somewhat against the run of play , franck ribery gave the visitors the lead three minutes from the break after claiming the ball close to the center line . the french international ran through the sporting half , evaded two markers and waved away italian striker luca toni , opting to shoot himself , and he made no mistake , slotting past sporting goalkeeper tiago . bayern added a second in the 57th minute when germany striker miroslav klose stole past his marker and pushed a long cross from massimo oddo over the goal line .
as toni just touched the ball with his head before it came to klose , the scorer was in an offside position , but referee bertrand layec gave the goal . worse was to follow for sporting as fabio rochemback brought down germany defender philipp lahm in the area just five minutes later , and ribery made no mistake from the spot to make it 3-0 . problems at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said there is still plenty of room to improve for bayern late in the game , toni added two more with ribery providing the assists in both cases to totally humiliate the home side . bayern coach juergen klinsmann said that even though he was proud of his side , they needed to concentrate on their next game . " i am hopeful that this has given the side a boost ahead of our next game in the bundesliga , " he said .
" i am confident that the players will not get carried away by this result .
the team can be proud of their game in lisbon , but we now need to concentrate on the bundesliga .

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .

“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .
" state governments should ... ensure that their legislation and procedures are compatible with germany 's international human rights obligations , guaranteeing in particular that these do not discriminate on grounds of gender or religion , " the group said . nda / th -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .

carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .
german carmakers including volkswagen , bmw and daimler , the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz cars have already cut production and placed employees on reduced working hours as they face up to the global economic slowdown. nda / th -lrb- dpa / afp / rtrs -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have no interest in the collapse of the us car industry , but what happens there to help them must follow international rules , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said on wednesday , feb .
25 .
" we will not hesitate to take the necessary steps if that should not happen . " the brussels-based executive will make sure that national governments stick to the rules on fair competition " both inside and outside the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market , " he stressed . us automakers gm and chrysler have already received $ 17.4 billion -lrb- 13.7 billion euros -rrb- in emergency government loans , but said on feb .
17 that they would need nearly $ 10 billion in additional federal aid over the coming months if they were to turn the corner . on the same day , gm said that it would sell its swedish-based subsidiary , saab , and could do the same with german subsidiary opel .
saab filed for bankruptcy protection three days later , while opel has asked the german government for an estimated 3.3 billion euros in loan guarantees . gm to blame for opel 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bungling at us headquarters has wrought bad times in germany verheugen said the commission intended to protect gm 's european subsidiaries , adding , " we do not believe that you can solve the overcapacity problem by throwing the weakest people off the sledge . " but he also stressed that any aid to opel would have to be accompanied by thorough restructuring plans , placing the blame for the situation squarely on gm . " the problems do not simply stem from the sales crisis , they are the result of years of management failure in the -lrb- gm -rrb- headquarters in detroit , " he said .
" the european tax-payer can not foot the bill for it just like that . " thousands of opel employees had gathered to demonstrate on thursday , to call for the german company to become independent of its troubled american parent .
opel is also expected to unveil a new business plan this week amidst speculation that it might look for government support , perhaps even combined with independence from gm . lobby wants to increase demand for cars the car industry accounts for some 12 million jobs across europe , but it has been especially hard hit by the global economic crash , with new passenger car registrations in january slumping by 27 percent compared with the same month last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new-car registrations plummeted sharply in january on wednesday , the european car manufacturers ' umbrella group , acea , called on the eu to protect the industry by allowing state lending support , boosting funding by the european investment bank and bringing in measures to encourage consumers to buy new cars . france , italy , spain , britain , germany and sweden have all launched plans in recent days to support domestic car makers . strings being attached concerns have , however , arisen over clauses such as a french condition that any company that receives state aid should promise not to close its factories in france . such a clause would break the eu 's rules on the free movement of companies , and could force the closure of french-owned factories in other eu member states , commission officials have warned . " you ca n't be a believer in the single market for car sales and on the other hand say ' i 'm not a believer in the single market for production ' , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . on tuesday , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his policy , saying he had been forced to launch it because the eu had failed to approve a europe-wide support scheme . but a report in wednesday 's edition of french daily le figaro suggested that paris was prepared to back down on the clause . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .
" state governments should ... ensure that their legislation and procedures are compatible with germany 's international human rights obligations , guaranteeing in particular that these do not discriminate on grounds of gender or religion , " the group said . nda / th -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .

einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .

they were " responsible for mass expulsions of kosovo albanian civilians from their homes , as well as incidents of killing , sexual assault , and the intentional destruction of mosques , " the court said .
" it was the deliberate actions of these forces during this campaign that caused the departure of at least 700,000 kosovo albanians from kosovo in the short period of time between the end of march and beginning of june 1999 , " bonomy said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.02.2009 spotlight berlin : illegal immigrants and the health care dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no sure way to know how many people live in germany illegally berlin may introduce an " anonymous insurance certificate " to allow illegal residents to see a doctor without legal repercussions .
deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.02.2009 thousands demonstrate to save jobs at crisis-hit opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not the first time opel workers have taken to the streets ; 2004 also saw demonstrations auto manufacturer opel is fighting to survive after being plunged into crisis by struggling parent us giant general motors .
now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.02.2009 thousands demonstrate to save jobs at crisis-hit opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not the first time opel workers have taken to the streets ; 2004 also saw demonstrations auto manufacturer opel is fighting to survive after being plunged into crisis by struggling parent us giant general motors .
now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 26.02.2009 berlin politician reignites debate on npd ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians would ultimately like to see the npd banned berlin 's interior minister has disclosed restricted information on undercover infiltration of the far-right npd .
his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .
he joined the npd in 2000. sac / th -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bavarians blew away sporting lisbon 5-0 . the german champions made history with the widest ever away victory margin in the champions league by trouncing sporting lisbon 5-0 . bayern , who went into the game on the back of a miserable start to the second half of the bundesliga side and lost 2-1 at home to cologne on the weekend , started much stronger in lisbon . sporting are the only team left in the champions league who have never reached the competition 's quarter-finals and the thumping they received at home has likely put that goal out of reach this season as well . ribery sublime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich were caught flat-footed by cologne in the bundesliga although bayern still had problems creating chances in the first half , the defense stood tall , and , somewhat against the run of play , franck ribery gave the visitors the lead three minutes from the break after claiming the ball close to the center line . the french international ran through the sporting half , evaded two markers and waved away italian striker luca toni , opting to shoot himself , and he made no mistake , slotting past sporting goalkeeper tiago . bayern added a second in the 57th minute when germany striker miroslav klose stole past his marker and pushed a long cross from massimo oddo over the goal line .
as toni just touched the ball with his head before it came to klose , the scorer was in an offside position , but referee bertrand layec gave the goal . worse was to follow for sporting as fabio rochemback brought down germany defender philipp lahm in the area just five minutes later , and ribery made no mistake from the spot to make it 3-0 . problems at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said there is still plenty of room to improve for bayern late in the game , toni added two more with ribery providing the assists in both cases to totally humiliate the home side . bayern coach juergen klinsmann said that even though he was proud of his side , they needed to concentrate on their next game .

" we have no interest in the collapse of the us car industry , but what happens there to help them must follow international rules , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said on wednesday , feb .
25 .
" we will not hesitate to take the necessary steps if that should not happen . " the brussels-based executive will make sure that national governments stick to the rules on fair competition " both inside and outside the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market , " he stressed . us automakers gm and chrysler have already received $ 17.4 billion -lrb- 13.7 billion euros -rrb- in emergency government loans , but said on feb .
17 that they would need nearly $ 10 billion in additional federal aid over the coming months if they were to turn the corner . on the same day , gm said that it would sell its swedish-based subsidiary , saab , and could do the same with german subsidiary opel .
saab filed for bankruptcy protection three days later , while opel has asked the german government for an estimated 3.3 billion euros in loan guarantees . gm to blame for opel 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bungling at us headquarters has wrought bad times in germany verheugen said the commission intended to protect gm 's european subsidiaries , adding , " we do not believe that you can solve the overcapacity problem by throwing the weakest people off the sledge . " but he also stressed that any aid to opel would have to be accompanied by thorough restructuring plans , placing the blame for the situation squarely on gm . " the problems do not simply stem from the sales crisis , they are the result of years of management failure in the -lrb- gm -rrb- headquarters in detroit , " he said .
" the european tax-payer can not foot the bill for it just like that . " thousands of opel employees had gathered to demonstrate on thursday , to call for the german company to become independent of its troubled american parent .
opel is also expected to unveil a new business plan this week amidst speculation that it might look for government support , perhaps even combined with independence from gm . lobby wants to increase demand for cars the car industry accounts for some 12 million jobs across europe , but it has been especially hard hit by the global economic crash , with new passenger car registrations in january slumping by 27 percent compared with the same month last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new-car registrations plummeted sharply in january on wednesday , the european car manufacturers ' umbrella group , acea , called on the eu to protect the industry by allowing state lending support , boosting funding by the european investment bank and bringing in measures to encourage consumers to buy new cars . france , italy , spain , britain , germany and sweden have all launched plans in recent days to support domestic car makers . strings being attached concerns have , however , arisen over clauses such as a french condition that any company that receives state aid should promise not to close its factories in france . such a clause would break the eu 's rules on the free movement of companies , and could force the closure of french-owned factories in other eu member states , commission officials have warned . " you ca n't be a believer in the single market for car sales and on the other hand say ' i 'm not a believer in the single market for production ' , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . on tuesday , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his policy , saying he had been forced to launch it because the eu had failed to approve a europe-wide support scheme . but a report in wednesday 's edition of french daily le figaro suggested that paris was prepared to back down on the clause . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .

his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .

the bavarians blew away sporting lisbon 5-0 . the german champions made history with the widest ever away victory margin in the champions league by trouncing sporting lisbon 5-0 . bayern , who went into the game on the back of a miserable start to the second half of the bundesliga side and lost 2-1 at home to cologne on the weekend , started much stronger in lisbon . sporting are the only team left in the champions league who have never reached the competition 's quarter-finals and the thumping they received at home has likely put that goal out of reach this season as well . ribery sublime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich were caught flat-footed by cologne in the bundesliga although bayern still had problems creating chances in the first half , the defense stood tall , and , somewhat against the run of play , franck ribery gave the visitors the lead three minutes from the break after claiming the ball close to the center line . the french international ran through the sporting half , evaded two markers and waved away italian striker luca toni , opting to shoot himself , and he made no mistake , slotting past sporting goalkeeper tiago . bayern added a second in the 57th minute when germany striker miroslav klose stole past his marker and pushed a long cross from massimo oddo over the goal line .
as toni just touched the ball with his head before it came to klose , the scorer was in an offside position , but referee bertrand layec gave the goal . worse was to follow for sporting as fabio rochemback brought down germany defender philipp lahm in the area just five minutes later , and ribery made no mistake from the spot to make it 3-0 . problems at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said there is still plenty of room to improve for bayern late in the game , toni added two more with ribery providing the assists in both cases to totally humiliate the home side . bayern coach juergen klinsmann said that even though he was proud of his side , they needed to concentrate on their next game . " i am hopeful that this has given the side a boost ahead of our next game in the bundesliga , " he said .
" i am confident that the players will not get carried away by this result .
the team can be proud of their game in lisbon , but we now need to concentrate on the bundesliga . " bayern captain mark van bommel also that the victory was great but means little if they do n't follow it up with a good game in the bundesliga . " after the win , there was no euphoria amongst the players in the change rooms , " he said .
" on sunday we have an important bundesliga match , and we are looking towards that .
we played a good game and made it very difficult for them to get through . " author : sean sinico -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .

" we have no interest in the collapse of the us car industry , but what happens there to help them must follow international rules , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said on wednesday , feb .
25 .
" we will not hesitate to take the necessary steps if that should not happen . " the brussels-based executive will make sure that national governments stick to the rules on fair competition " both inside and outside the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market , " he stressed . us automakers gm and chrysler have already received $ 17.4 billion -lrb- 13.7 billion euros -rrb- in emergency government loans , but said on feb .
17 that they would need nearly $ 10 billion in additional federal aid over the coming months if they were to turn the corner . on the same day , gm said that it would sell its swedish-based subsidiary , saab , and could do the same with german subsidiary opel .
saab filed for bankruptcy protection three days later , while opel has asked the german government for an estimated 3.3 billion euros in loan guarantees . gm to blame for opel 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bungling at us headquarters has wrought bad times in germany verheugen said the commission intended to protect gm 's european subsidiaries , adding , " we do not believe that you can solve the overcapacity problem by throwing the weakest people off the sledge . " but he also stressed that any aid to opel would have to be accompanied by thorough restructuring plans , placing the blame for the situation squarely on gm . " the problems do not simply stem from the sales crisis , they are the result of years of management failure in the -lrb- gm -rrb- headquarters in detroit , " he said .
" the european tax-payer can not foot the bill for it just like that . " thousands of opel employees had gathered to demonstrate on thursday , to call for the german company to become independent of its troubled american parent .
opel is also expected to unveil a new business plan this week amidst speculation that it might look for government support , perhaps even combined with independence from gm . lobby wants to increase demand for cars the car industry accounts for some 12 million jobs across europe , but it has been especially hard hit by the global economic crash , with new passenger car registrations in january slumping by 27 percent compared with the same month last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new-car registrations plummeted sharply in january on wednesday , the european car manufacturers ' umbrella group , acea , called on the eu to protect the industry by allowing state lending support , boosting funding by the european investment bank and bringing in measures to encourage consumers to buy new cars . france , italy , spain , britain , germany and sweden have all launched plans in recent days to support domestic car makers . strings being attached concerns have , however , arisen over clauses such as a french condition that any company that receives state aid should promise not to close its factories in france . such a clause would break the eu 's rules on the free movement of companies , and could force the closure of french-owned factories in other eu member states , commission officials have warned . " you ca n't be a believer in the single market for car sales and on the other hand say ' i 'm not a believer in the single market for production ' , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . on tuesday , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his policy , saying he had been forced to launch it because the eu had failed to approve a europe-wide support scheme . but a report in wednesday 's edition of french daily le figaro suggested that paris was prepared to back down on the clause . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bavarians blew away sporting lisbon 5-0 . the german champions made history with the widest ever away victory margin in the champions league by trouncing sporting lisbon 5-0 . bayern , who went into the game on the back of a miserable start to the second half of the bundesliga side and lost 2-1 at home to cologne on the weekend , started much stronger in lisbon . sporting are the only team left in the champions league who have never reached the competition 's quarter-finals and the thumping they received at home has likely put that goal out of reach this season as well . ribery sublime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich were caught flat-footed by cologne in the bundesliga although bayern still had problems creating chances in the first half , the defense stood tall , and , somewhat against the run of play , franck ribery gave the visitors the lead three minutes from the break after claiming the ball close to the center line . the french international ran through the sporting half , evaded two markers and waved away italian striker luca toni , opting to shoot himself , and he made no mistake , slotting past sporting goalkeeper tiago . bayern added a second in the 57th minute when germany striker miroslav klose stole past his marker and pushed a long cross from massimo oddo over the goal line .
as toni just touched the ball with his head before it came to klose , the scorer was in an offside position , but referee bertrand layec gave the goal . worse was to follow for sporting as fabio rochemback brought down germany defender philipp lahm in the area just five minutes later , and ribery made no mistake from the spot to make it 3-0 . problems at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said there is still plenty of room to improve for bayern late in the game , toni added two more with ribery providing the assists in both cases to totally humiliate the home side . bayern coach juergen klinsmann said that even though he was proud of his side , they needed to concentrate on their next game . " i am hopeful that this has given the side a boost ahead of our next game in the bundesliga , " he said .
" i am confident that the players will not get carried away by this result .
the team can be proud of their game in lisbon , but we now need to concentrate on the bundesliga . " bayern captain mark van bommel also that the victory was great but means little if they do n't follow it up with a good game in the bundesliga . " after the win , there was no euphoria amongst the players in the change rooms , " he said .

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.02.2009 thousands demonstrate to save jobs at crisis-hit opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not the first time opel workers have taken to the streets ; 2004 also saw demonstrations auto manufacturer opel is fighting to survive after being plunged into crisis by struggling parent us giant general motors .
now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .

germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 26.02.2009 berlin politician reignites debate on npd ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians would ultimately like to see the npd banned berlin 's interior minister has disclosed restricted information on undercover infiltration of the far-right npd .
his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .
he joined the npd in 2000. sac / th -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 26.02.2009 berlin politician reignites debate on npd ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians would ultimately like to see the npd banned berlin 's interior minister has disclosed restricted information on undercover infiltration of the far-right npd .
his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .

but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .

his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .

" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .

it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .

the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .

the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .

einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .

echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .

opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .

another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.02.2009 german ban on headscarves violates rights , says watchdog großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of german states have laws banning headscarves according to a report published by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , the law banning female teachers from wearing the islamic headscarf in parts of germany violates the rights of muslim women . in its 67-page report , published thursday , feb .
26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .
" state governments should ... ensure that their legislation and procedures are compatible with germany 's international human rights obligations , guaranteeing in particular that these do not discriminate on grounds of gender or religion , " the group said . nda / th -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .
german carmakers including volkswagen , bmw and daimler , the manufacturer of luxury mercedes-benz cars have already cut production and placed employees on reduced working hours as they face up to the global economic slowdown. nda / th -lrb- dpa / afp / rtrs -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.02.2009 spotlight berlin : illegal immigrants and the health care dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no sure way to know how many people live in germany illegally berlin may introduce an " anonymous insurance certificate " to allow illegal residents to see a doctor without legal repercussions .
deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .

26 , to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs . thousands of workers employed by general motors in europe took to the streets thursday to demonstrate against the giant us carmaker 's sweeping restructuring plans and to save their jobs .
the protests came as gm 's german offshoot opel prepared to unveil a rescue plan for the german operations and the government in berlin stepped up its criticism of the us-based auto group amid a deepening crisis in the global car industry .
carrying placards saying " no closures in europe , " " free opel " and " opel can not be allowed to die , " up to 15,000 demonstrators turned up for the rally held at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
many workers were bussed in from other opel plants in eisenach , bochum and kaiserslautern to protest planned job cuts and closures .
trade union ig metall 's boss berthold huber told the assembled masses that opel could not be allowed to perish .
" we 're not going to accept plant closures or layoffs , " he said .
steinmeier pledges to keep opel in business demonstrators listened intently as germany 's vice chancellor and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier pledged to help keep opel in business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he would fight for opel jobs " this is a fight for jobs and i 'm fighting without any reservation for you , " steinmeier said outside the company , which has been making cars in germany since 1899 .
" opel is a part of german history .
we 've got to defend that history .
" this is about more than just opel .
it 's about the future of the car industry in germany .
the car sector is n't just any ordinary industry here .
it 's the backbone of our economy , " steinmeier , the social democrat 's chancellor candidate chosen to run against chancellor angela merkel in september 's federal election , said .
merkel told a news conference in berlin she had not yet seen the required restructuring plan to decide on any state help for opel but that if it needed it , the priority would be financing guarantees rather than more direct state aid .
" germany has an interest in strengthening companies which have a strong foundation , " she said .
opel , once germany 's biggest carmaker , is just one of general motors ' european brands which are near collapse in the wake of the global crisis .
the german firm has been hit by weak demand and its woes have been aggravated by troubles at its us parent .
it became the first european carmaker to seek a government bailout since the financial crisis began , asking the german government for backing to guarantee loans of about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for 2009 .
sources close to the company say it needs 3.3 billion euros to keep afloat through to the end of 2011 .
economics minister blasts gm at the same time of the demonstrations , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was lashing out at detroit-based gm , criticizing the company for failing to provide adequate information about future business plan for opel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg made it clear who he thinks is to blame the german economics minister said up until now both potential investors and the german government still did not know what the gm group planned for opel , which is expected to unveil a rescue plan possibly on friday which opel hopes will pave the way for berlin to provide the struggling carmaker with aid .
but the european commission warned thursday that it would take action to head off countries providing what it considered to be unfair support to their national car sectors .
in addition to germany , gm has operations in britain , spain and sweden .
however , gm 's swedish saab company has already filed for bankruptcy protection .
as part of the plans under consideration by opel , the auto group is also weighing up breaking away completely from its troubled us parent that is threatened with insolvency despite $ 17.4 billion washington lent gm and rival chrysler last year .
gm 's far-reaching restructuring plans include big job cuts worldwide and could result in its hiving off parts of its international operations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.02.2009 thousands demonstrate to save jobs at crisis-hit opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its not the first time opel workers have taken to the streets ; 2004 also saw demonstrations auto manufacturer opel is fighting to survive after being plunged into crisis by struggling parent us giant general motors .
now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .
24 .
einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .
leaflets handed out at opel 's plant in ruesselsheim demanded that there should be " no plant closures and no layoffs " and called for workers to protest .
opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .

now , workers at the company 's plants across europe are demonstrating to save their jobs . between 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators were expected to attend a midmorning rally at opel 's german headquarters in the western city of ruesselsheim .
germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the social democrat candidate in september 's general elections , was expected to attend the rally along with bertold huber , the head of germany 's powerful ig metall union .
demonstrations were also planned at the plants in kaiserslautern and the eastern city of eisenach .
" we want to expose our demands clearly once again , " rainer einenkel , the head of the works council at gm 's plant in bochum , western germany , had told reporters on tuesday , feb .

einenkel said he would attend a meeting of opel 's supervisory board on friday , feb .
27 , where management would present an " opel rescue plan " at the meeting at the request of the german government .
echoing einenkel 's call to protest , the european metalworkers federation -lrb- emf -rrb- said in a statement tuesday that it would oppose any forced plant closures or job cuts .

opel backtracks on job cuts at eisenach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for the corsa has saved jobs in eisenach - for now the protests come despite opel 's announcement on wednesday that it had dropped plans to push through redundancies at its plant in eisenach and would assign additional technical teams at the plant to increase its output of the popular corsa model .
the company " no longer needs the initial plan for shorter work hours in eisenach , " a statement said .
while auto demand and production overall has slumped dramatically as the global economic crisis slashes consumer spending , cost-conscious customers have been looking at smaller , more-efficient and cheaper models as a result .
demand for the corsa has also been boosted by a government incentive scheme that encourages drivers to turn in old cars for new models that pollute less .
european commission gets tough on bail outs meanwhile , any plans for the german government to bail out the stricken car manufacturer were dealt a blow from brussels when the european union 's executive announced that it would use the force of law to fight countries that give unfair support to their national car industries , be it in the eu or the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants more aid from the us government to survive the financial times deutschland reported tuesday that berlin may be willing to pump money into opel , without citing sources .
however , it was reported that berlin told opel to come up with a viable business plan if it wants to benefit from state aid .
another option would be the acquisition of a direct stake in the ailing automaker , although the idea is opposed by some within the country 's ruling coalition .
eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said that the european commission would protect gm 's european subsidiaries but stressed that any aid to opel would have to come from restructuring plans .
gm employs 55,000 workers in europe , primarily in britain , germany , spain and sweden .
the company wants to restructure its european organization as it looks to stem huge losses .

" we have no interest in the collapse of the us car industry , but what happens there to help them must follow international rules , " eu industry commissioner guenter verheugen said on wednesday , feb .
25 .
" we will not hesitate to take the necessary steps if that should not happen . " the brussels-based executive will make sure that national governments stick to the rules on fair competition " both inside and outside the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market , " he stressed . us automakers gm and chrysler have already received $ 17.4 billion -lrb- 13.7 billion euros -rrb- in emergency government loans , but said on feb .
17 that they would need nearly $ 10 billion in additional federal aid over the coming months if they were to turn the corner . on the same day , gm said that it would sell its swedish-based subsidiary , saab , and could do the same with german subsidiary opel .
saab filed for bankruptcy protection three days later , while opel has asked the german government for an estimated 3.3 billion euros in loan guarantees . gm to blame for opel 's woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bungling at us headquarters has wrought bad times in germany verheugen said the commission intended to protect gm 's european subsidiaries , adding , " we do not believe that you can solve the overcapacity problem by throwing the weakest people off the sledge . " but he also stressed that any aid to opel would have to be accompanied by thorough restructuring plans , placing the blame for the situation squarely on gm . " the problems do not simply stem from the sales crisis , they are the result of years of management failure in the -lrb- gm -rrb- headquarters in detroit , " he said .
" the european tax-payer can not foot the bill for it just like that . " thousands of opel employees had gathered to demonstrate on thursday , to call for the german company to become independent of its troubled american parent .
opel is also expected to unveil a new business plan this week amidst speculation that it might look for government support , perhaps even combined with independence from gm . lobby wants to increase demand for cars the car industry accounts for some 12 million jobs across europe , but it has been especially hard hit by the global economic crash , with new passenger car registrations in january slumping by 27 percent compared with the same month last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new-car registrations plummeted sharply in january on wednesday , the european car manufacturers ' umbrella group , acea , called on the eu to protect the industry by allowing state lending support , boosting funding by the european investment bank and bringing in measures to encourage consumers to buy new cars . france , italy , spain , britain , germany and sweden have all launched plans in recent days to support domestic car makers . strings being attached concerns have , however , arisen over clauses such as a french condition that any company that receives state aid should promise not to close its factories in france . such a clause would break the eu 's rules on the free movement of companies , and could force the closure of french-owned factories in other eu member states , commission officials have warned . " you ca n't be a believer in the single market for car sales and on the other hand say ' i 'm not a believer in the single market for production ' , " eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said . on tuesday , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his policy , saying he had been forced to launch it because the eu had failed to approve a europe-wide support scheme . but a report in wednesday 's edition of french daily le figaro suggested that paris was prepared to back down on the clause . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 26.02.2009 german ban on headscarves violates rights , says watchdog großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of german states have laws banning headscarves according to a report published by human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- , the law banning female teachers from wearing the islamic headscarf in parts of germany violates the rights of muslim women . in its 67-page report , published thursday , feb .
26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .
" state governments should ... ensure that their legislation and procedures are compatible with germany 's international human rights obligations , guaranteeing in particular that these do not discriminate on grounds of gender or religion , " the group said . nda / th -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de french headscarf ban not discrimination , says european court europe ’ s top courts have ruled in favor of a french school that expelled two muslim girls for refusing to remove their headscarves for physical education classes .

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .
" state governments should ... ensure that their legislation and procedures are compatible with germany 's international human rights obligations , guaranteeing in particular that these do not discriminate on grounds of gender or religion , " the group said . nda / th -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 26.02.2009 berlin politician reignites debate on npd ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many politicians would ultimately like to see the npd banned berlin 's interior minister has disclosed restricted information on undercover infiltration of the far-right npd .
his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .
he joined the npd in 2000. sac / th -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as toni just touched the ball with his head before it came to klose , the scorer was in an offside position , but referee bertrand layec gave the goal . worse was to follow for sporting as fabio rochemback brought down germany defender philipp lahm in the area just five minutes later , and ribery made no mistake from the spot to make it 3-0 . problems at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann said there is still plenty of room to improve for bayern late in the game , toni added two more with ribery providing the assists in both cases to totally humiliate the home side . bayern coach juergen klinsmann said that even though he was proud of his side , they needed to concentrate on their next game . " i am hopeful that this has given the side a boost ahead of our next game in the bundesliga , " he said .
" i am confident that the players will not get carried away by this result .
the team can be proud of their game in lisbon , but we now need to concentrate on the bundesliga . " bayern captain mark van bommel also that the victory was great but means little if they do n't follow it up with a good game in the bundesliga . " after the win , there was no euphoria amongst the players in the change rooms , " he said .
" on sunday we have an important bundesliga match , and we are looking towards that .
we played a good game and made it very difficult for them to get through . " author : sean sinico -lrb- afp / dpa / reuters -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks at the issue of illegal immigration and health care in germany . germany is home to an estimated one million illegal migrants ; in berlin alone , up to 250,000 people live without any personal identity documents .
that means they also lack the health insurance card that 's required to get full medical treatment here . according to german asylum laws , these people are entitled to medical treatment in cases of emergency .
the problem is that if they reveal their identity they will be treated - but might end up being deported as a result . no political solution to this dilemma in the form of new laws is in sight .
but the city state of berlin is now seriously considering introducing an anonymous health insurance card for illegal residents on a case-by-case basis . welfare offices would cover the costs for cardholders ' treatments .
the senate is looking into the feasability of such a scheme . read on for background information on health care and illegal immigration in germany . germany classifies as an illegal migrant foreigners who enter germany without a valid passport , residence permit or visa .
they are not otherwise exempt from these requirements , such as through european union law or other international agreements . also , breaking the conditions set by a visa or residency permit , such as staying longer in germany than allowed , can result in a person becoming an illegal immigrant . in germany , doctors , hospitals , social workers , teachers and other employees at public institutions - often called upon to help illegal immigrants - are among those who can be subject to legal action if they fail to report illegal immigrants to authorities .
this is not the case in many other european countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors can be stuck with the bill for treating illegal immigrants the german legal clause that governs this issue states that people who help instigate , prolong or support the stay of an illegal immigrant can be penalized . yet doctors ' groups , among others , oppose this ruling .
they say they should n't be required to report patients ' personal information , including immigration status , to authorities . because public health care is covered by insurance providers , facilities that provide care to illegal immigrants without health insurance often have to pay for the treatment themselves . in its 2007 migration report , the german federal office for migration and refugees -lrb- bamf -rrb- said the covert nature of illegal immigration makes it difficult to discern the exact number of illegal immigrants in germany .
but non-governmental organizations in germany have estimated the number of illegal immigrants in the country to be between 100,000 and one million . the bamf , however , added that indicators - including the number of people caught trying to illegally enter the country , raids against human trafficking and smuggling operations , and the number of crimes committed by illegal immigrants - pointed to a nearly constant decrease in illegal immigration since 1998 . escaping poverty , war and repression , as well as family reunification , are among the main reasons people attempt to illegally enter germany , the government said . authors : hardy graupner / sean sinico editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .

most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .

26 , showed . the nuremberg-based labor office said the nation 's dole queues swelled by a seasonally adjusted 40,000 this month to 3.311 million after the numbers out of work rose by 56,000 in january .
this pushed the unemployment rate up to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent .
analysts had predicted the numbers without jobs in february would rise to 60,000 in seasonally adjusted terms , which analysts see as pointing to the underlying labor market trends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weise was the bearer of more bad news " unemployment is rising , employment is declining and the demand for labor is falling , " said labor office chief frank-juergen weise .
in the politically more important unadjusted terms , the unemployment rose by 63,000 to 3.552 million , as a result pushing the jobless rate up from 8.3 percent in january to 8.5 percent this month .
a hard winter that curbed construction activity in the biggest european economy played a major role in the rise while a series of announcements by companies about plans for layoffs were also likely to have impacted on the february labor market data .
after resisting the effects of the global economic downturn , the german labor market has deteriorated quickly .
in november the number of unemployed dipped briefly below the level of 3.0 million .
and without the widespread use of part-time working hours by german companies the overall deterioration would have been much worse .

his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .

koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court refused to ban the npd in 2003 " talk is silver , silence is golden , mr. koerting , " paris said .
brandenburg 's interior minister joerg schoenbohm from the cdu said koerting 's statements " broke a taboo " in the conference of interior ministers by divulging information .
but koerting said his statements corresponded to the openly presented line agreed on by the spd interior ministers in 2007 .
it had stated that police informants in top npd positions were inacceptable .
new ban ?
koerting 's remarks have sparked a renewed discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
the move is disputed among the federal states .
schoenbohm said there was no majority in the upper and lower houses of parliament for new ban proceedings .
the debate about it would only benefit the npd in this election year , he said .
politicians from the spd and the opposition greens said it was important to pull together on the issue .
green party head claudia roth said the debate about a new ban could not become " a place for tactical profiling among democrats . "
she said pulling out informants could increase the chances of success in new ban proceedings .
" but it 's clear that all democratic forces have to act in concert here , " roth said .
konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .
" nothing would play into the hands of right-wing extremists more than a quarrel among democrats , " freiberg said .
paris said the conference of interior ministers in april 2008 had agreed on battling the npd with all democratic means .
the consensus had been to distance themselves from further ban proceedings , he said .
most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .
but they said they would continue using police informants in order to have adequate material .
the spd expert on domestic affairs dieter wiefelspuetz said , however , police moles were overestimated .
he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .
he was directly arrested in the courtroom due to flight risk .
once a left-wing militant and founding member of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , mahler is a trained lawyer who later in life switched sides and became a far-right activist .
he joined the npd in 2000. sac / th -lrb- ap / dpa / reuters -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .

according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "

some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .

his claims have caused outrage among leading politicians and set off a new dispute on banning the party . berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting has defended his statements calling for an end to undercover police informants within the far-right extremist party npd .
" i find it to be objectionable if , for instance , the head of berlin 's npd was a police informant , " koerting told the newspaper tagesspiegel on thursday , feb .
26 .
" it 's not right for a democracy to indirectly lead unconstitutional parties . "
koerting - a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - earlier this week said that he and his three spd counterparts from schleswig-holstein , saxony-anhalt and rhineland-palatinate had shut down their undercover agents in top npd bodies .
this would allow them to try again to ban the npd , koerting had told the left-wing newspaper neues deutschland .
germany 's previous center-left government had tried to outlaw the party .
but the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe dismissed the case in 2003 .
it said that the government had relied on evidence supplied by secret informants paid to incriminate the party .
breaking a taboo the federal interior minister and member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- wolfgang schaeuble sharply criticized koerting 's statements .
divulging facts about undercover operations made it harder for the federal security agency bfv to do their work .
this was " grossly negligent , " schaeuble 's spokesman stefan paris said .

konrad freiberg , head of the german police officers ' union , agreed .

most conservative politicians said they were in favor of an npd ban only if it had chance of success .

he told the newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung on thursday that their significance as sources were " excessively overrated " as they usually did not deliver any reliable information on the party .
" anyone who says otherwise has no clue , " wiefelspuetz said .
far-right extremist sentenced to prison term meanwhile , the munich district court on wednesday sentenced lawyer and right-wing extremist horst mahler on three charges of inciting racial hatred and denying the holocaust .
the 73-year-old was sentenced to six years in prison .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahler has been repeatedly sentenced for holocaust denial the leading judge martin rieder said mahler was " entirely unrepentant . "
in his closing words lasting some 10 hours , mahler said he would " not cease to battle the holocaust lie . "
mahler was charged after holding a public speech in which he denied the holocaust took place and posting holocaust denials on the internet .
mahler reacted to the sentence with a snicker .

26 , hrw said that ban , in force in half of the 16 german states , " discriminates against muslim women , excluding them from teaching and other public sector employment on the basis of their faith . "
the laws were all introduced in the last five years , following a 2003 constitutional court ruling that restrictions on religious dress are only permissible if explicitly laid down by law .
the remaining eight german states have no such restrictions .
based on extensive research and interviews with women affected by the law over an eight-month period , the hrw " discrimination in the name of neutrality : headscarf bans for teachers and civil servants in germany , " analyzes the human rights implications of the bans and their effect on the lives of muslim women teachers , including those who have been employed for many years .
it says that the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave germany , where they have lived all their lives .
teachers forced to choose between job and religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teachers who do not comply face consequences " the measures effectively force women to choose between their employment and the manifestation of their religious beliefs , violating their right to freedom of religion and equal treatment , " the new york-based hrw said .
" the regulations are not abstract concerns .
the restrictions have a profound effect on women 's lives . "
" these laws discriminate on the grounds of both gender and religion and violate these women 's human rights , " said haleh chahrokh , researcher in the europe and central asia division at hrw in a statement .
according to the hrw report , while none of the laws explicitly target the headscarf , parliamentary debates and official explanatory documents prior to their introduction make clear that the headscarf is the focus .
“ every court case about the restrictions has concerned the headscarf issue , ” the report states .
" the claim that these restrictions do n't discriminate does n't stand up , " said chahrokh , " in practice , the only people affected by them are muslim women who wear the headscarf .
" people should be judged on the basis of their conduct , not views imputed to them by virtue of a religious symbol they wear , " chahrokh added .
" if there are concrete concerns about individuals , they should be addressed through ordinary disciplinary procedures , on a case-by-case basis . "
compromises rebutted , says hrw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alternative headscarf designs were rejected the hrw report claims that teachers wearing the headscarf have been told to remove it and been have subject to disciplinary action if they refused .
some of the teachers affected told human rights watch that they had offered to wear alternatives to the headscarf , such as large hats , or to tie the scarves in atypical styles , but that these offers were rejected .
the islamic headscarf has been the subject of heated political debate in germany , home to three million muslims and the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
following a series of court cases , the federal constitutional court ruled it was up to germany 's states to decide their policy , prompting an even split amongst the 16 regions .
hrw recommended that the eight states where a ban is in force should repeal the laws .
" state governments should ... ensure that their legislation and procedures are compatible with germany 's international human rights obligations , guaranteeing in particular that these do not discriminate on grounds of gender or religion , " the group said . nda / th -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i got married , had my wife there , when -lsb- my brother -rsb- got married , he had his wife there so we ended up being 10 people in one property in the end , " he told me .
but before investing more in state housing , it is important to learn the lessons of the past .
the original mission of social housing was not simply to put a roof over people 's heads , but to ensure that poor people were able to remain in the mainstream of society , rather than being distanced by their poverty ; and to provide a secure base upon which people could seek work .
on both these counts , the evidence suggests social housing has been failing in recent decades .
' living tapestry ' post-war labour housing minister nye bevan argued for a social mix on council estates .
he aimed to replicate " the lovely feature of the english and welsh village , where the doctor , the grocer , the butcher and farm labourer all lived on the same street - the living tapestry of a mixed community . "

until the 1980s , council housing was in fact embraced by a fairly broad swathe of the population .
since then , council estates have seen increased concentration of social problems , in part because of a shift towards providing homes on the basis of social need .
professor john hills from the london school of economics is britain 's leading analyst of social housing .
he is worried about the consequences of this policy .
" if you had started saying what we want is housing provided for people in greatest need , i do n't think anybody in their right mind would have thought let 's build it all in big estates and put all those people together in the same place . "
most working-age adults in social housing are out of paid work .
seven out of 10 tenant families are in the bottom two-fifths of the population in terms of income .
social housing tenants are twice as likely to be unemployed and twice as likely to be lone parents as those living in private rented accommodation or their own homes .
" you are then creating a situation where one group of people , who end up with difficulties in the labour market to start with , are away from contact with the run-of-the-mill services , jobs , knowledge about jobs that one would expect in the rest of society , " says hills .
" from the point of view of society as a whole , the idea of walling away one group of people from the rest of the society , so that people become invisible to the mainstream , is not a healthy part of the political process . "
security if social housing is - for good reason - going to be focused on the most needy , the only way to avoid vast monoculture estates is to build " mixed tenure " developments . "
what people want is a home , not just somewhere to lay down their head for a few nights " alan walter , defend council housing housing associations - private but not-for-profit providers - were leading this charge until they were hit hard by the downturn in the owner-occupied sector , which helped fund these developments .
but there is no reason why local authorities should not show more imagination in the way they construct estates , and go for a better social mix .
one of the most controversial and sensitive areas in social housing policy is security of tenure .
this means that once you have got a council tenancy you can keep it , regardless of any later changes in family size or income .
in theory , you can go from an impoverished single parent of five to a millionaire lottery winner and keep your council flat .
one of the main arguments for this policy is to ensure that social housing tenants are not put off going into a job .
the fear of many policymakers is that if people fear losing their home if they succeed in getting paid work they will be less likely to look for a job .
alan walter , of defend council housing , wants to ensure social housing tenants do not face any more insecurity .
" what people want is a home , not just somewhere to lay down their head for a few nights , " he says .
" there is something that i find really offensive when you have politicians talking about council housing as if it is just a short-term fallback for those in desperate need . "
on the other hand , security of tenure does not appear to having the positive effects on levels of employment that the economic textbooks suggest it should .
social housing tenants are significantly less likely to move into paid work than private renters .
the goals of social housing remain salient : to provide decent , affordable homes for those unable to secure them , to allow children of low-income families to grow up in the mainstream of society , and to provide adults with a platform upon which to build independent lives and careers .
the trouble is , social housing is not delivering on its promise .
on current trends , it risks becoming anti-social housing .

but before investing more in state housing , it is important to learn the lessons of the past .
the original mission of social housing was not simply to put a roof over people 's heads , but to ensure that poor people were able to remain in the mainstream of society , rather than being distanced by their poverty ; and to provide a secure base upon which people could seek work .
on both these counts , the evidence suggests social housing has been failing in recent decades .
' living tapestry ' post-war labour housing minister nye bevan argued for a social mix on council estates .

listen to the programme analysis : anti-social housing will be broadcast on bbc radio 4 thursday 26 february at 2030 gmt or subscribe to the programme 's podcast .
until the 1980s , council housing was in fact embraced by a fairly broad swathe of the population .
since then , council estates have seen increased concentration of social problems , in part because of a shift towards providing homes on the basis of social need .
professor john hills from the london school of economics is britain 's leading analyst of social housing .
he is worried about the consequences of this policy .
" if you had started saying what we want is housing provided for people in greatest need , i do n't think anybody in their right mind would have thought let 's build it all in big estates and put all those people together in the same place . "
most working-age adults in social housing are out of paid work .
seven out of 10 tenant families are in the bottom two-fifths of the population in terms of income .
social housing tenants are twice as likely to be unemployed and twice as likely to be lone parents as those living in private rented accommodation or their own homes .
" you are then creating a situation where one group of people , who end up with difficulties in the labour market to start with , are away from contact with the run-of-the-mill services , jobs , knowledge about jobs that one would expect in the rest of society , " says hills .
" from the point of view of society as a whole , the idea of walling away one group of people from the rest of the society , so that people become invisible to the mainstream , is not a healthy part of the political process . "
security if social housing is - for good reason - going to be focused on the most needy , the only way to avoid vast monoculture estates is to build " mixed tenure " developments .
what people want is a home , not just somewhere to lay down their head for a few nights alan walter , defend council housing housing associations - private but not-for-profit providers - were leading this charge until they were hit hard by the downturn in the owner-occupied sector , which helped fund these developments .
but there is no reason why local authorities should not show more imagination in the way they construct estates , and go for a better social mix .
one of the most controversial and sensitive areas in social housing policy is security of tenure .
this means that once you have got a council tenancy you can keep it , regardless of any later changes in family size or income .
in theory , you can go from an impoverished single parent of five to a millionaire lottery winner and keep your council flat .
one of the main arguments for this policy is to ensure that social housing tenants are not put off going into a job .
the fear of many policymakers is that if people fear losing their home if they succeed in getting paid work they will be less likely to look for a job .
alan walter , of defend council housing , wants to ensure social housing tenants do not face any more insecurity .
" what people want is a home , not just somewhere to lay down their head for a few nights , " he says .
" there is something that i find really offensive when you have politicians talking about council housing as if it is just a short-term fallback for those in desperate need . "
on the other hand , security of tenure does not appear to having the positive effects on levels of employment that the economic textbooks suggest it should .
social housing tenants are significantly less likely to move into paid work than private renters .
the goals of social housing remain salient : to provide decent , affordable homes for those unable to secure them , to allow children of low-income families to grow up in the mainstream of society , and to provide adults with a platform upon which to build independent lives and careers .
the trouble is , social housing is not delivering on its promise .
on current trends , it risks becoming anti-social housing .

on both these counts , the evidence suggests social housing has been failing in recent decades .
' living tapestry ' post-war labour housing minister nye bevan argued for a social mix on council estates .
he aimed to replicate " the lovely feature of the english and welsh village , where the doctor , the grocer , the butcher and farm labourer all lived on the same street - the living tapestry of a mixed community . "
listen to the programme analysis : anti-social housing will be broadcast on bbc radio 4 thursday 26 february at 2030 gmt or subscribe to the programme 's podcast .
until the 1980s , council housing was in fact embraced by a fairly broad swathe of the population .
since then , council estates have seen increased concentration of social problems , in part because of a shift towards providing homes on the basis of social need .
professor john hills from the london school of economics is britain 's leading analyst of social housing .
he is worried about the consequences of this policy .
" if you had started saying what we want is housing provided for people in greatest need , i do n't think anybody in their right mind would have thought let 's build it all in big estates and put all those people together in the same place . "
most working-age adults in social housing are out of paid work .
seven out of 10 tenant families are in the bottom two-fifths of the population in terms of income .
social housing tenants are twice as likely to be unemployed and twice as likely to be lone parents as those living in private rented accommodation or their own homes .
" you are then creating a situation where one group of people , who end up with difficulties in the labour market to start with , are away from contact with the run-of-the-mill services , jobs , knowledge about jobs that one would expect in the rest of society , " says hills .
" from the point of view of society as a whole , the idea of walling away one group of people from the rest of the society , so that people become invisible to the mainstream , is not a healthy part of the political process . "
security if social housing is - for good reason - going to be focused on the most needy , the only way to avoid vast monoculture estates is to build " mixed tenure " developments .
what people want is a home , not just somewhere to lay down their head for a few nights alan walter , defend council housing housing associations - private but not-for-profit providers - were leading this charge until they were hit hard by the downturn in the owner-occupied sector , which helped fund these developments .
but there is no reason why local authorities should not show more imagination in the way they construct estates , and go for a better social mix .
one of the most controversial and sensitive areas in social housing policy is security of tenure .
this means that once you have got a council tenancy you can keep it , regardless of any later changes in family size or income .
in theory , you can go from an impoverished single parent of five to a millionaire lottery winner and keep your council flat .
one of the main arguments for this policy is to ensure that social housing tenants are not put off going into a job .
the fear of many policymakers is that if people fear losing their home if they succeed in getting paid work they will be less likely to look for a job .
alan walter , of defend council housing , wants to ensure social housing tenants do not face any more insecurity .
" what people want is a home , not just somewhere to lay down their head for a few nights , " he says .
" there is something that i find really offensive when you have politicians talking about council housing as if it is just a short-term fallback for those in desperate need . "
on the other hand , security of tenure does not appear to having the positive effects on levels of employment that the economic textbooks suggest it should .
social housing tenants are significantly less likely to move into paid work than private renters .
the goals of social housing remain salient : to provide decent , affordable homes for those unable to secure them , to allow children of low-income families to grow up in the mainstream of society , and to provide adults with a platform upon which to build independent lives and careers .
the trouble is , social housing is not delivering on its promise .
on current trends , it risks becoming anti-social housing .

the state would become landlord instead .
after falling out of favour during the thatcher and blair administrations , council housing is back on the political agenda .

it has been a lifeline for people like emran shaheen .
he has just moved into a housing association flat in south london .
until recently , both his and his brother 's family had been sharing a two-bedroom flat .
" i got married , had my wife there , when -lsb- my brother -rsb- got married , he had his wife there so we ended up being 10 people in one property in the end , " he told me .
but before investing more in state housing , it is important to learn the lessons of the past .
the original mission of social housing was not simply to put a roof over people 's heads , but to ensure that poor people were able to remain in the mainstream of society , rather than being distanced by their poverty ; and to provide a secure base upon which people could seek work .
on both these counts , the evidence suggests social housing has been failing in recent decades .
' living tapestry ' post-war labour housing minister nye bevan argued for a social mix on council estates .
he aimed to replicate " the lovely feature of the english and welsh village , where the doctor , the grocer , the butcher and farm labourer all lived on the same street - the living tapestry of a mixed community . "
listen to the programme analysis : anti-social housing will be broadcast on bbc radio 4 thursday 26 february at 2030 gmt or subscribe to the programme 's podcast .
until the 1980s , council housing was in fact embraced by a fairly broad swathe of the population .
since then , council estates have seen increased concentration of social problems , in part because of a shift towards providing homes on the basis of social need .
professor john hills from the london school of economics is britain 's leading analyst of social housing .
he is worried about the consequences of this policy .
" if you had started saying what we want is housing provided for people in greatest need , i do n't think anybody in their right mind would have thought let 's build it all in big estates and put all those people together in the same place . "
most working-age adults in social housing are out of paid work .
seven out of 10 tenant families are in the bottom two-fifths of the population in terms of income .
social housing tenants are twice as likely to be unemployed and twice as likely to be lone parents as those living in private rented accommodation or their own homes .
" you are then creating a situation where one group of people , who end up with difficulties in the labour market to start with , are away from contact with the run-of-the-mill services , jobs , knowledge about jobs that one would expect in the rest of society , " says hills .
" from the point of view of society as a whole , the idea of walling away one group of people from the rest of the society , so that people become invisible to the mainstream , is not a healthy part of the political process . "
security if social housing is - for good reason - going to be focused on the most needy , the only way to avoid vast monoculture estates is to build " mixed tenure " developments .
what people want is a home , not just somewhere to lay down their head for a few nights alan walter , defend council housing housing associations - private but not-for-profit providers - were leading this charge until they were hit hard by the downturn in the owner-occupied sector , which helped fund these developments .
but there is no reason why local authorities should not show more imagination in the way they construct estates , and go for a better social mix .
one of the most controversial and sensitive areas in social housing policy is security of tenure .
this means that once you have got a council tenancy you can keep it , regardless of any later changes in family size or income .
in theory , you can go from an impoverished single parent of five to a millionaire lottery winner and keep your council flat .
one of the main arguments for this policy is to ensure that social housing tenants are not put off going into a job .
the fear of many policymakers is that if people fear losing their home if they succeed in getting paid work they will be less likely to look for a job .
alan walter , of defend council housing , wants to ensure social housing tenants do not face any more insecurity .
" what people want is a home , not just somewhere to lay down their head for a few nights , " he says .
" there is something that i find really offensive when you have politicians talking about council housing as if it is just a short-term fallback for those in desperate need . "
on the other hand , security of tenure does not appear to having the positive effects on levels of employment that the economic textbooks suggest it should .
social housing tenants are significantly less likely to move into paid work than private renters .
the goals of social housing remain salient : to provide decent , affordable homes for those unable to secure them , to allow children of low-income families to grow up in the mainstream of society , and to provide adults with a platform upon which to build independent lives and careers .
the trouble is , social housing is not delivering on its promise .
on current trends , it risks becoming anti-social housing .
richard reeves is director of the independent think tank demos .

on both these counts , the evidence suggests social housing has been failing in recent decades .
' living tapestry ' post-war labour housing minister nye bevan argued for a social mix on council estates .
he aimed to replicate " the lovely feature of the english and welsh village , where the doctor , the grocer , the butcher and farm labourer all lived on the same street - the living tapestry of a mixed community . "
listen to the programme analysis : anti-social housing will be broadcast on bbc radio 4 thursday 26 february at 2030 gmt or subscribe to the programme 's podcast .
until the 1980s , council housing was in fact embraced by a fairly broad swathe of the population .
since then , council estates have seen increased concentration of social problems , in part because of a shift towards providing homes on the basis of social need .
professor john hills from the london school of economics is britain 's leading analyst of social housing .
he is worried about the consequences of this policy .
" if you had started saying what we want is housing provided for people in greatest need , i do n't think anybody in their right mind would have thought let 's build it all in big estates and put all those people together in the same place . "
most working-age adults in social housing are out of paid work .
seven out of 10 tenant families are in the bottom two-fifths of the population in terms of income .
social housing tenants are twice as likely to be unemployed and twice as likely to be lone parents as those living in private rented accommodation or their own homes .
" you are then creating a situation where one group of people , who end up with difficulties in the labour market to start with , are away from contact with the run-of-the-mill services , jobs , knowledge about jobs that one would expect in the rest of society , " says hills .
" from the point of view of society as a whole , the idea of walling away one group of people from the rest of the society , so that people become invisible to the mainstream , is not a healthy part of the political process . "
security if social housing is - for good reason - going to be focused on the most needy , the only way to avoid vast monoculture estates is to build " mixed tenure " developments .
what people want is a home , not just somewhere to lay down their head for a few nights alan walter , defend council housing housing associations - private but not-for-profit providers - were leading this charge until they were hit hard by the downturn in the owner-occupied sector , which helped fund these developments .
but there is no reason why local authorities should not show more imagination in the way they construct estates , and go for a better social mix .
one of the most controversial and sensitive areas in social housing policy is security of tenure .
this means that once you have got a council tenancy you can keep it , regardless of any later changes in family size or income .
in theory , you can go from an impoverished single parent of five to a millionaire lottery winner and keep your council flat .
one of the main arguments for this policy is to ensure that social housing tenants are not put off going into a job .
the fear of many policymakers is that if people fear losing their home if they succeed in getting paid work they will be less likely to look for a job .
alan walter , of defend council housing , wants to ensure social housing tenants do not face any more insecurity .
" what people want is a home , not just somewhere to lay down their head for a few nights , " he says .
" there is something that i find really offensive when you have politicians talking about council housing as if it is just a short-term fallback for those in desperate need . "
on the other hand , security of tenure does not appear to having the positive effects on levels of employment that the economic textbooks suggest it should .
social housing tenants are significantly less likely to move into paid work than private renters .
the goals of social housing remain salient : to provide decent , affordable homes for those unable to secure them , to allow children of low-income families to grow up in the mainstream of society , and to provide adults with a platform upon which to build independent lives and careers .
the trouble is , social housing is not delivering on its promise .
on current trends , it risks becoming anti-social housing .

the occasions in which we write by hand are fewer and fewer , says neil hallows .
so is the ancient art form of handwriting dying out ?
a century from now , our handwriting may only be legible to experts .
for some , that is already the case .
but writer kitty burns florey says the art of handwriting is declining so fast that ordinary , joined-up script may become as hard to read as a medieval manuscript .
" when your great-great-grandchildren find that letter of yours in the attic , they 'll have to take it to a specialist , an old guy at the library who would decipher the strange symbols for them , " says ms florey , author of the newly-published script and scribble : the rise and fall of handwriting .
she argues that children - if not this generation then one soon to come - may grow up using only a crude form of printing for the rare occasions in life they need to communicate by pen .
the way handwriting is taught has undoubtedly changed .
at ms florey 's school in 1950s america , a nun beat time with a stick as the class copied letters from the blackboard .
it was not a place for individuals .
there was a right way to form letters and very many wrong ways .
for much of the last century british schools ran in a similar way .
at my primary school in the 1970s , whole classes were devoted to work being " written up for best " and i remember a story coming back unmarked because i had crossed out a single word .
i wonder what my teachers would have made of a james joyce manuscript .
crossing 7s many found the experience tedious , but for left-handers it could be torture .
often they were forced to write with their right , while their " bad " hand was tied down .
more than a century of children turning out letters by the yard produced a great conformity .
in the 1940s ealing drama , went the day well ? , a contingent of german soldiers sets up camp in the english countryside , disguised as royal engineers .
one reason they get rumbled is that a soldier writes a " 7 " with a line through it .
" why should they form their figures in a continental way ? " a villager asks . "
if everything we do still had to be done by hand , there would not be enough hours in the day " registrar ruth hodson send us your handwriting these days , the shape of a child 's ovals , loops and slants matters less than what they write .
" content is everything , " says mark brown , head teacher of st mary 's catholic primary school in axminster , devon .
" the emphasis is much more on having a go , and expressing yourself , and getting the ideas down . "
he says letter formation is still taught in the early years of primary school , but the appearance of handwriting takes less of a priority as children get older , provided it remains legible .
some parents expect handwriting to be drilled in the same way as they experienced themselves , but mr brown argues the content of children 's writing has significantly improved as a result of the change in emphasis , and that they write far more at school than they will as adults .
scrawling so once we leave school , does it really matter ?
apart from the odd shopping list , do people still need to use a pen ?
some do .
registrars of births , deaths and marriages have been recording life 's significant events in their usually impeccable writing since 1837 .
" all registrars are conscious that they follow a long and noble tradition , " says ruth hodson , interim registration manager for peterborough city council .
but even their fountain pens will soon barely be heard scratching on the registers .
under a modernisation programme , an increasing amount of the information is being entered directly on to a computer .
ms hodson is unsentimental .
" if everything we do still had to be done by hand , there would not be enough hours in the day . "
but perhaps handwriting gains its greatest importance when it is least legible .
the reputation of doctors for scrawling was enhanced by a study in the british medical journal which found medics ' writing was considerably worse than other healthcare workers or administrative staff .
poor writing has often been blamed for medication errors .
gwyn williams , a junior doctor in carmarthen , says that despite technological advances , a great deal of clinical communication is still handwritten .
" we have to write so much , on so many occasions , with the clock ticking .
the end result is so difficult to interpret that even i have to concentrate on occasions to work out what -lsb- i have written -rsb- .
" there does n't seem to be any other logical way of doing it .
typing clinical notes on a computer seems so cumbersome in the limited time available that i ca n't see how it would work . "
in many jobs though , a person can go for months , even years , writing only the odd phone message in their own script .
nevertheless , some employers still ask for a handwritten application , or a sample of writing , although the chartered institute of personnel and development warns employers they need to be clear about the reason for that , to avoid accusations of discrimination .
10-page letters there are those who see handwriting 's slip in educational priority and increasingly eccentric role in the workplace as evidence that , in the west at least , we are forgetting an ancient art form .
a panic , perhaps , and one witnessed every time the dominant style of writing changed or a new form of technology seemed to threaten it .
an early typewriter led the scientific american in 1867 to marvel that " the weary process of learning penmanship in schools will be reduced to -lsb- writing -rsb- one 's own signature and playing on the literary piano " . "
maybe a couple of times a week -lsb- pupils -rsb- could produce something handwritten that is judged partly on its legibility , or even its beauty " kitty burns florey but look at the decline in letter writing .
the students i knew two decades ago who knocked out 10-page letters during a morning in bed have probably not yet written 10 pages of handwritten prose of any kind this year .
for ms florey , the answer should start in the classroom .
not a return to the nuns with sticks , but for children to value handwriting by learning a simple , legible , attractive script from the start - in her view a form of italic - and then keep reinforcing it beyond the early years .
" maybe a couple of times a week -lsb- pupils -rsb- could produce something handwritten that is judged partly on its legibility , or even its beauty . "
adults too can improve their writing , in a matter of weeks with a textbook and expert advice .
apple co-founder steve jobs has said that if he had not taken a calligraphy course at college , he would not have thought of putting multiple typefaces on the mac .
perhaps the best argument for keeping our pens is that otherwise , in a society that is recorded in more detail than any which came before it , we will leave plenty of data but very little of our personalities behind .
our descendants may struggle to read our letters , but they 'll never even see most of our texts and e-mails .

my handwriting deteriorated appallingly as i began to use computers almost exclusively for communication .
the pda i use has a stylus and is supposed to be able to learn and translate handwriting , but it , -lrb- quite understandably -rrb- , fails to translate anything i write .
i experimented last year and found that it was possible to write with a fountain pen if i concentrated exclusively upon forming the letters and keeping on a straight line , and felt some pride at my achievement .
if modern life were not so frantic and noisy , i daresay i could sit for an hour each day and write my journals in ink , but is it worth it ?
where 's the cut and paste , where 's the ability to search through months and years of notes for a phrase ?
nobody washes their clothes by hand anymore either .
should that too be taught in schools ?
adrian stapley , semley , wiltshire , uk kids in primary schools in japan spend a lesson or two a week learning " the way of writing " , using thick calligraphy brushes to write kanji characters .
it 's an art form and takes great skill .
at the start of a new year , many kids gather in the assembly hall and lay out long sheets of paper , prep their brushes and write something , usually with four kanji , that means something to them personally about how they 'd like the next year to pan out .
writing here has deep cultural roots .
dan in japan , japan fascinating article and something i have often thought about myself .
i recently noted at work that i have n't needed a pen in at least a year .
as a left-handed person who was forced to learn to write with my right i have always had dire handwriting and for some years nothing but block capitals has been my standard , personally i see little value in handwriting skills in the modern age and my son 's scrawl is of little concern to me compared to the actual learning he is doing at school .
personally i am glad to hear of the change of emphasis from appearance to content .
david goldsworthy , redditch it is surprising easy to create your own typeface for your computer , maybe this is answer .
i dislike my own handwriting but as a graphic designer have created some beautiful custom fonts for my work .
there will be no need for people to translate our scrawling just look at the google digitalisation of our worlds libraries to see we will simply upload it for a translation .
phil , devon i am sure there were plenty of people who bemoaned the demise of cuneiform as a writing technology .
however , the idea of keeping our children chipping away at muddy grey tablets seems as strange to me as wrestling with ink filled tubes .
time to move on people .
andy bird , lincoln i hand-write as a matter of course , many comment " how nice to receive a written letter " .
in france a handwritten letter is the expected form of formal communication tom davies , faucigny , bonneville , france until the age of 11 writing was the only thing i received 10/10 for .
i was always last out of school finishing off my writing .
in later years i became a calligrapher but calligraphy is not a way to improve handwriting as the letters are formed quite differently .
however , copperplate writing the victorians did should be brought back into schools for its clarity and beauty .
writing is an art .
although i type correctly and use a computer constantly i still send handwritten letters to those i deem it important to do so - it shows i care .
ann hall , bedford i was invited to a gentlemen 's dinner last night .
i am about to write a " thank you " letter to my host .
i will be using a fountain pen .
it is easy to bang out an e-mail , but a hand written note on headed paper conveys real gratitude patrick farrelly , saunton i realised , after the death of my parents , that i had kept very few of the letters they had sent me .
to me , writing is one of the most personal and intimate parts of any individual .
my mother wrote often as i was living in france and i feel that i have too lightly discarded this part of my memories of her .
for this reason i started a handwritten journal for each of my three children .
i write of my thoughts and their actions and i hope they will read them when i am gone and smile , laugh and even shed a few fond tears when recalling the events of which i write .
david harrison , saint-sulpice-de-favieres , france when i was at primary school , in the late forties , we had wooden pens with a metal pen nib and our source of ink was an ink well .
being left handed was a problem because the ink well was always sunk in to the top right hand corner of the desk .
this meant that frequently my exercise book pages became dog-eared and sometimes there were dribbles of ink across the page .
punishments were usually in the form of writing the same sentence 100 times , commonly called lines .
so we had plenty of practise at writing .
today i am frequently asked to write addresses on envelopes , at work as well as at home because my handwriting is legible .
i have always maintained a legible signature .
i encouraged both my son and daughter to develop a reasonable , legible standard of hand writing .
i told them that an essay legibly and neatly written usually attracted extra marks for presentation .
tom brockett , manchester , england i am surprised that your article did not mention the need for writing by hand in exams .
i only completed my masters degree two years ago and there was no hint of typing my exam answers .
i needed to be ready to write solidly and legibly for three hours and it is important that children and made ready for this by some importance placed on handwriting .
claire , watford , uk i have awful handwriting , it is poorly formed and not uniform- despite my best efforts at school and now i just do not have neat -lrb- although it is legible -rrb- handwriting .
during my early years at school -lrb- in the 1980s -rrb- i was constanty bullied by teachers a for my poor writing .
one teacher even commented that i would not get anywhere in life because of my handwriting .
i am sure i am not the only one .
i applaud a change in the education system where a student can be marked on the contents of their written expression , not just the appearance .
little miss messy , brisbane , australia i have often expressed my opinions on the decline of handwriting .
i was taught by nuns in my primary years and we were always helped and encouraged to produce good handwriting .
i also think we have lost an awful lot with electronically produced birth , marriage & death certificates .
it is a joy to read old handwritten documents .

the occasions in which we write by hand are fewer and fewer , says neil hallows .
so is the ancient art form of handwriting dying out ?
a century from now , our handwriting may only be legible to experts .
for some , that is already the case .
but writer kitty burns florey says the art of handwriting is declining so fast that ordinary , joined-up script may become as hard to read as a medieval manuscript .
" when your great-great-grandchildren find that letter of yours in the attic , they 'll have to take it to a specialist , an old guy at the library who would decipher the strange symbols for them , " says ms florey , author of the newly-published script and scribble : the rise and fall of handwriting .
famous handwriting king henry viii wrote this love letter to anne boleyn -lrb- pic : british library -rrb- jane austen completed her last novel , persuasion , in 1816 in 1864 , lewis carroll wrote his most famous work for alice liddell .
aged 16 , winston churchill wrote to his mother lady randolph churchill jimi hendrix 's lyrics for machine gun were written in 1969 back -lcb- current -rcb- of -lcb- total -rcb- next she argues that children - if not this generation then one soon to come - may grow up using only a crude form of printing for the rare occasions in life they need to communicate by pen .
the way handwriting is taught has undoubtedly changed .
at ms florey 's school in 1950s america , a nun beat time with a stick as the class copied letters from the blackboard .
it was not a place for individuals .
there was a right way to form letters and very many wrong ways .
for much of the last century british schools ran in a similar way .
at my primary school in the 1970s , whole classes were devoted to work being " written up for best " and i remember a story coming back unmarked because i had crossed out a single word .
i wonder what my teachers would have made of a james joyce manuscript .
crossing 7s many found the experience tedious , but for left-handers it could be torture .
often they were forced to write with their right , while their " bad " hand was tied down .
more than a century of children turning out letters by the yard produced a great conformity .
in the 1940s ealing drama , went the day well ? , a contingent of german soldiers sets up camp in the english countryside , disguised as royal engineers .
one reason they get rumbled is that a soldier writes a " 7 " with a line through it .
" why should they form their figures in a continental way ? " a villager asks .
if everything we do still had to be done by hand , there would not be enough hours in the day registrar ruth hodson send us your handwriting these days , the shape of a child 's ovals , loops and slants matters less than what they write .
" content is everything , " says mark brown , head teacher of st mary 's catholic primary school in axminster , devon .
" the emphasis is much more on having a go , and expressing yourself , and getting the ideas down . "
he says letter formation is still taught in the early years of primary school , but the appearance of handwriting takes less of a priority as children get older , provided it remains legible .
some parents expect handwriting to be drilled in the same way as they experienced themselves , but mr brown argues the content of children 's writing has significantly improved as a result of the change in emphasis , and that they write far more at school than they will as adults .
scrawling so once we leave school , does it really matter ?
apart from the odd shopping list , do people still need to use a pen ?
some do .
registrars of births , deaths and marriages have been recording life 's significant events in their usually impeccable writing since 1837 .
writer 's hand : not a word crossed out in this instance of neil hallows ' writing " all registrars are conscious that they follow a long and noble tradition , " says ruth hodson , interim registration manager for peterborough city council .
but even their fountain pens will soon barely be heard scratching on the registers .
under a modernisation programme , an increasing amount of the information is being entered directly on to a computer .
ms hodson is unsentimental .
" if everything we do still had to be done by hand , there would not be enough hours in the day . "
but perhaps handwriting gains its greatest importance when it is least legible .
the reputation of doctors for scrawling was enhanced by a study in the british medical journal which found medics ' writing was considerably worse than other healthcare workers or administrative staff .
poor writing has often been blamed for medication errors .
gwyn williams , a junior doctor in carmarthen , says that despite technological advances , a great deal of clinical communication is still handwritten .
remember this ?
" we have to write so much , on so many occasions , with the clock ticking .
the end result is so difficult to interpret that even i have to concentrate on occasions to work out what -lsb- i have written -rsb- .
" there does n't seem to be any other logical way of doing it .
typing clinical notes on a computer seems so cumbersome in the limited time available that i ca n't see how it would work . "
in many jobs though , a person can go for months , even years , writing only the odd phone message in their own script .
nevertheless , some employers still ask for a handwritten application , or a sample of writing , although the chartered institute of personnel and development warns employers they need to be clear about the reason for that , to avoid accusations of discrimination .
10-page letters there are those who see handwriting 's slip in educational priority and increasingly eccentric role in the workplace as evidence that , in the west at least , we are forgetting an ancient art form .
a panic , perhaps , and one witnessed every time the dominant style of writing changed or a new form of technology seemed to threaten it .
an early typewriter led the scientific american in 1867 to marvel that " the weary process of learning penmanship in schools will be reduced to -lsb- writing -rsb- one 's own signature and playing on the literary piano " .
maybe a couple of times a week -lsb- pupils -rsb- could produce something handwritten that is judged partly on its legibility , or even its beauty kitty burns florey but look at the decline in letter writing .
the students i knew two decades ago who knocked out 10-page letters during a morning in bed have probably not yet written 10 pages of handwritten prose of any kind this year .
for ms florey , the answer should start in the classroom .
not a return to the nuns with sticks , but for children to value handwriting by learning a simple , legible , attractive script from the start - in her view a form of italic - and then keep reinforcing it beyond the early years .
" maybe a couple of times a week -lsb- pupils -rsb- could produce something handwritten that is judged partly on its legibility , or even its beauty . "
adults too can improve their writing , in a matter of weeks with a textbook and expert advice .
apple co-founder steve jobs has said that if he had not taken a calligraphy course at college , he would not have thought of putting multiple typefaces on the mac .
perhaps the best argument for keeping our pens is that otherwise , in a society that is recorded in more detail than any which came before it , we will leave plenty of data but very little of our personalities behind .
our descendants may struggle to read our letters , but they 'll never even see most of our texts and e-mails .
show us your handwriting 1 .
here are three examples of handwriting , courtesy of the magazine team -lrb- in ascending order of readability -rrb- 2 .
we 've written the pangram : " how quickly daft jumping zebras vex " and underneath our name and age 3 .
now we want you to write the same sentence , with your name and age underneath 4 .

my handwriting deteriorated appallingly as i began to use computers almost exclusively for communication .
the pda i use has a stylus and is supposed to be able to learn and translate handwriting , but it , -lrb- quite understandably -rrb- , fails to translate anything i write .
i experimented last year and found that it was possible to write with a fountain pen if i concentrated exclusively upon forming the letters and keeping on a straight line , and felt some pride at my achievement .
if modern life were not so frantic and noisy , i daresay i could sit for an hour each day and write my journals in ink , but is it worth it ?
where 's the cut and paste , where 's the ability to search through months and years of notes for a phrase ?
nobody washes their clothes by hand anymore either .
should that too be taught in schools ?
adrian stapley , semley , wiltshire , uk kids in primary schools in japan spend a lesson or two a week learning " the way of writing " , using thick calligraphy brushes to write kanji characters .
it 's an art form and takes great skill .
at the start of a new year , many kids gather in the assembly hall and lay out long sheets of paper , prep their brushes and write something , usually with four kanji , that means something to them personally about how they 'd like the next year to pan out .
writing here has deep cultural roots .
dan in japan , japan fascinating article and something i have often thought about myself .
i recently noted at work that i have n't needed a pen in at least a year .
as a left-handed person who was forced to learn to write with my right i have always had dire handwriting and for some years nothing but block capitals has been my standard , personally i see little value in handwriting skills in the modern age and my son 's scrawl is of little concern to me compared to the actual learning he is doing at school .
personally i am glad to hear of the change of emphasis from appearance to content .
david goldsworthy , redditch it is surprising easy to create your own typeface for your computer , maybe this is answer .
i dislike my own handwriting but as a graphic designer have created some beautiful custom fonts for my work .
there will be no need for people to translate our scrawling just look at the google digitalisation of our worlds libraries to see we will simply upload it for a translation .
phil , devon i am sure there were plenty of people who bemoaned the demise of cuneiform as a writing technology .
however , the idea of keeping our children chipping away at muddy grey tablets seems as strange to me as wrestling with ink filled tubes .
time to move on people .
andy bird , lincoln i hand-write as a matter of course , many comment " how nice to receive a written letter " .
in france a handwritten letter is the expected form of formal communication tom davies , faucigny , bonneville , france until the age of 11 writing was the only thing i received 10/10 for .
i was always last out of school finishing off my writing .
in later years i became a calligrapher but calligraphy is not a way to improve handwriting as the letters are formed quite differently .
however , copperplate writing the victorians did should be brought back into schools for its clarity and beauty .
writing is an art .
although i type correctly and use a computer constantly i still send handwritten letters to those i deem it important to do so - it shows i care .

the occasions in which we write by hand are fewer and fewer , says neil hallows .
so is the ancient art form of handwriting dying out ?
a century from now , our handwriting may only be legible to experts .
for some , that is already the case .
but writer kitty burns florey says the art of handwriting is declining so fast that ordinary , joined-up script may become as hard to read as a medieval manuscript .
" when your great-great-grandchildren find that letter of yours in the attic , they 'll have to take it to a specialist , an old guy at the library who would decipher the strange symbols for them , " says ms florey , author of the newly-published script and scribble : the rise and fall of handwriting .
famous handwriting king henry viii wrote this love letter to anne boleyn -lrb- pic : british library -rrb- jane austen completed her last novel , persuasion , in 1816 in 1864 , lewis carroll wrote his most famous work for alice liddell .
aged 16 , winston churchill wrote to his mother lady randolph churchill jimi hendrix 's lyrics for machine gun were written in 1969 back -lcb- current -rcb- of -lcb- total -rcb- next she argues that children - if not this generation then one soon to come - may grow up using only a crude form of printing for the rare occasions in life they need to communicate by pen .
the way handwriting is taught has undoubtedly changed .
at ms florey 's school in 1950s america , a nun beat time with a stick as the class copied letters from the blackboard .
it was not a place for individuals .
there was a right way to form letters and very many wrong ways .
for much of the last century british schools ran in a similar way .
at my primary school in the 1970s , whole classes were devoted to work being " written up for best " and i remember a story coming back unmarked because i had crossed out a single word .
i wonder what my teachers would have made of a james joyce manuscript .
crossing 7s many found the experience tedious , but for left-handers it could be torture .
often they were forced to write with their right , while their " bad " hand was tied down .
more than a century of children turning out letters by the yard produced a great conformity .
in the 1940s ealing drama , went the day well ? , a contingent of german soldiers sets up camp in the english countryside , disguised as royal engineers .
one reason they get rumbled is that a soldier writes a " 7 " with a line through it .
" why should they form their figures in a continental way ? " a villager asks .
if everything we do still had to be done by hand , there would not be enough hours in the day registrar ruth hodson send us your handwriting these days , the shape of a child 's ovals , loops and slants matters less than what they write .
" content is everything , " says mark brown , head teacher of st mary 's catholic primary school in axminster , devon .
" the emphasis is much more on having a go , and expressing yourself , and getting the ideas down . "
he says letter formation is still taught in the early years of primary school , but the appearance of handwriting takes less of a priority as children get older , provided it remains legible .
some parents expect handwriting to be drilled in the same way as they experienced themselves , but mr brown argues the content of children 's writing has significantly improved as a result of the change in emphasis , and that they write far more at school than they will as adults .
scrawling so once we leave school , does it really matter ?
apart from the odd shopping list , do people still need to use a pen ?
some do .
registrars of births , deaths and marriages have been recording life 's significant events in their usually impeccable writing since 1837 .
writer 's hand : not a word crossed out in this instance of neil hallows ' writing " all registrars are conscious that they follow a long and noble tradition , " says ruth hodson , interim registration manager for peterborough city council .
but even their fountain pens will soon barely be heard scratching on the registers .
under a modernisation programme , an increasing amount of the information is being entered directly on to a computer .
ms hodson is unsentimental .
" if everything we do still had to be done by hand , there would not be enough hours in the day . "
but perhaps handwriting gains its greatest importance when it is least legible .
the reputation of doctors for scrawling was enhanced by a study in the british medical journal which found medics ' writing was considerably worse than other healthcare workers or administrative staff .
poor writing has often been blamed for medication errors .
gwyn williams , a junior doctor in carmarthen , says that despite technological advances , a great deal of clinical communication is still handwritten .
remember this ?
" we have to write so much , on so many occasions , with the clock ticking .
the end result is so difficult to interpret that even i have to concentrate on occasions to work out what -lsb- i have written -rsb- .
" there does n't seem to be any other logical way of doing it .
typing clinical notes on a computer seems so cumbersome in the limited time available that i ca n't see how it would work . "
in many jobs though , a person can go for months , even years , writing only the odd phone message in their own script .
nevertheless , some employers still ask for a handwritten application , or a sample of writing , although the chartered institute of personnel and development warns employers they need to be clear about the reason for that , to avoid accusations of discrimination .
10-page letters there are those who see handwriting 's slip in educational priority and increasingly eccentric role in the workplace as evidence that , in the west at least , we are forgetting an ancient art form .
a panic , perhaps , and one witnessed every time the dominant style of writing changed or a new form of technology seemed to threaten it .
an early typewriter led the scientific american in 1867 to marvel that " the weary process of learning penmanship in schools will be reduced to -lsb- writing -rsb- one 's own signature and playing on the literary piano " .
maybe a couple of times a week -lsb- pupils -rsb- could produce something handwritten that is judged partly on its legibility , or even its beauty kitty burns florey but look at the decline in letter writing .
the students i knew two decades ago who knocked out 10-page letters during a morning in bed have probably not yet written 10 pages of handwritten prose of any kind this year .
for ms florey , the answer should start in the classroom .
not a return to the nuns with sticks , but for children to value handwriting by learning a simple , legible , attractive script from the start - in her view a form of italic - and then keep reinforcing it beyond the early years .
" maybe a couple of times a week -lsb- pupils -rsb- could produce something handwritten that is judged partly on its legibility , or even its beauty . "
adults too can improve their writing , in a matter of weeks with a textbook and expert advice .
apple co-founder steve jobs has said that if he had not taken a calligraphy course at college , he would not have thought of putting multiple typefaces on the mac .
perhaps the best argument for keeping our pens is that otherwise , in a society that is recorded in more detail than any which came before it , we will leave plenty of data but very little of our personalities behind .
our descendants may struggle to read our letters , but they 'll never even see most of our texts and e-mails .

my handwriting deteriorated appallingly as i began to use computers almost exclusively for communication .
the pda i use has a stylus and is supposed to be able to learn and translate handwriting , but it , -lrb- quite understandably -rrb- , fails to translate anything i write .
i experimented last year and found that it was possible to write with a fountain pen if i concentrated exclusively upon forming the letters and keeping on a straight line , and felt some pride at my achievement .
if modern life were not so frantic and noisy , i daresay i could sit for an hour each day and write my journals in ink , but is it worth it ?
where 's the cut and paste , where 's the ability to search through months and years of notes for a phrase ?
nobody washes their clothes by hand anymore either .
should that too be taught in schools ?
adrian stapley , semley , wiltshire , uk kids in primary schools in japan spend a lesson or two a week learning " the way of writing " , using thick calligraphy brushes to write kanji characters .
it 's an art form and takes great skill .
at the start of a new year , many kids gather in the assembly hall and lay out long sheets of paper , prep their brushes and write something , usually with four kanji , that means something to them personally about how they 'd like the next year to pan out .
writing here has deep cultural roots .
dan in japan , japan fascinating article and something i have often thought about myself .
i recently noted at work that i have n't needed a pen in at least a year .
as a left-handed person who was forced to learn to write with my right i have always had dire handwriting and for some years nothing but block capitals has been my standard , personally i see little value in handwriting skills in the modern age and my son 's scrawl is of little concern to me compared to the actual learning he is doing at school .
personally i am glad to hear of the change of emphasis from appearance to content .
david goldsworthy , redditch it is surprising easy to create your own typeface for your computer , maybe this is answer .
i dislike my own handwriting but as a graphic designer have created some beautiful custom fonts for my work .
there will be no need for people to translate our scrawling just look at the google digitalisation of our worlds libraries to see we will simply upload it for a translation .

at the start of a new year , many kids gather in the assembly hall and lay out long sheets of paper , prep their brushes and write something , usually with four kanji , that means something to them personally about how they 'd like the next year to pan out .
writing here has deep cultural roots .
dan in japan , japan fascinating article and something i have often thought about myself .
i recently noted at work that i have n't needed a pen in at least a year .
as a left-handed person who was forced to learn to write with my right i have always had dire handwriting and for some years nothing but block capitals has been my standard , personally i see little value in handwriting skills in the modern age and my son 's scrawl is of little concern to me compared to the actual learning he is doing at school .
personally i am glad to hear of the change of emphasis from appearance to content .
david goldsworthy , redditch it is surprising easy to create your own typeface for your computer , maybe this is answer .
i dislike my own handwriting but as a graphic designer have created some beautiful custom fonts for my work .

phil , devon i am sure there were plenty of people who bemoaned the demise of cuneiform as a writing technology .
however , the idea of keeping our children chipping away at muddy grey tablets seems as strange to me as wrestling with ink filled tubes .
time to move on people .
andy bird , lincoln i hand-write as a matter of course , many comment " how nice to receive a written letter " .
in france a handwritten letter is the expected form of formal communication tom davies , faucigny , bonneville , france until the age of 11 writing was the only thing i received 10/10 for .
i was always last out of school finishing off my writing .
in later years i became a calligrapher but calligraphy is not a way to improve handwriting as the letters are formed quite differently .
however , copperplate writing the victorians did should be brought back into schools for its clarity and beauty .
writing is an art .
although i type correctly and use a computer constantly i still send handwritten letters to those i deem it important to do so - it shows i care .
ann hall , bedford i was invited to a gentlemen 's dinner last night .
i am about to write a " thank you " letter to my host .
i will be using a fountain pen .
it is easy to bang out an e-mail , but a hand written note on headed paper conveys real gratitude patrick farrelly , saunton i realised , after the death of my parents , that i had kept very few of the letters they had sent me .
to me , writing is one of the most personal and intimate parts of any individual .
my mother wrote often as i was living in france and i feel that i have too lightly discarded this part of my memories of her .
for this reason i started a handwritten journal for each of my three children .
i write of my thoughts and their actions and i hope they will read them when i am gone and smile , laugh and even shed a few fond tears when recalling the events of which i write .
david harrison , saint-sulpice-de-favieres , france when i was at primary school , in the late forties , we had wooden pens with a metal pen nib and our source of ink was an ink well .
being left handed was a problem because the ink well was always sunk in to the top right hand corner of the desk .
this meant that frequently my exercise book pages became dog-eared and sometimes there were dribbles of ink across the page .
punishments were usually in the form of writing the same sentence 100 times , commonly called lines .
so we had plenty of practise at writing .
today i am frequently asked to write addresses on envelopes , at work as well as at home because my handwriting is legible .
i have always maintained a legible signature .
i encouraged both my son and daughter to develop a reasonable , legible standard of hand writing .
i told them that an essay legibly and neatly written usually attracted extra marks for presentation .
tom brockett , manchester , england i am surprised that your article did not mention the need for writing by hand in exams .
i only completed my masters degree two years ago and there was no hint of typing my exam answers .
i needed to be ready to write solidly and legibly for three hours and it is important that children and made ready for this by some importance placed on handwriting .
claire , watford , uk i have awful handwriting , it is poorly formed and not uniform- despite my best efforts at school and now i just do not have neat -lrb- although it is legible -rrb- handwriting .
during my early years at school -lrb- in the 1980s -rrb- i was constanty bullied by teachers a for my poor writing .

i was taught by nuns in my primary years and we were always helped and encouraged to produce good handwriting .

the occasions in which we write by hand are fewer and fewer , says neil hallows .
so is the ancient art form of handwriting dying out ?
a century from now , our handwriting may only be legible to experts .
for some , that is already the case .
but writer kitty burns florey says the art of handwriting is declining so fast that ordinary , joined-up script may become as hard to read as a medieval manuscript .
" when your great-great-grandchildren find that letter of yours in the attic , they 'll have to take it to a specialist , an old guy at the library who would decipher the strange symbols for them , " says ms florey , author of the newly-published script and scribble : the rise and fall of handwriting .
famous handwriting king henry viii wrote this love letter to anne boleyn -lrb- pic : british library -rrb- jane austen completed her last novel , persuasion , in 1816 in 1864 , lewis carroll wrote his most famous work for alice liddell .
aged 16 , winston churchill wrote to his mother lady randolph churchill jimi hendrix 's lyrics for machine gun were written in 1969 back -lcb- current -rcb- of -lcb- total -rcb- next she argues that children - if not this generation then one soon to come - may grow up using only a crude form of printing for the rare occasions in life they need to communicate by pen .
the way handwriting is taught has undoubtedly changed .
at ms florey 's school in 1950s america , a nun beat time with a stick as the class copied letters from the blackboard .
it was not a place for individuals .
there was a right way to form letters and very many wrong ways .
for much of the last century british schools ran in a similar way .
at my primary school in the 1970s , whole classes were devoted to work being " written up for best " and i remember a story coming back unmarked because i had crossed out a single word .
i wonder what my teachers would have made of a james joyce manuscript .
crossing 7s many found the experience tedious , but for left-handers it could be torture .
often they were forced to write with their right , while their " bad " hand was tied down .
more than a century of children turning out letters by the yard produced a great conformity .
in the 1940s ealing drama , went the day well ? , a contingent of german soldiers sets up camp in the english countryside , disguised as royal engineers .
one reason they get rumbled is that a soldier writes a " 7 " with a line through it .
" why should they form their figures in a continental way ? " a villager asks .
if everything we do still had to be done by hand , there would not be enough hours in the day registrar ruth hodson send us your handwriting these days , the shape of a child 's ovals , loops and slants matters less than what they write .
" content is everything , " says mark brown , head teacher of st mary 's catholic primary school in axminster , devon .
" the emphasis is much more on having a go , and expressing yourself , and getting the ideas down . "
he says letter formation is still taught in the early years of primary school , but the appearance of handwriting takes less of a priority as children get older , provided it remains legible .
some parents expect handwriting to be drilled in the same way as they experienced themselves , but mr brown argues the content of children 's writing has significantly improved as a result of the change in emphasis , and that they write far more at school than they will as adults .
scrawling so once we leave school , does it really matter ?
apart from the odd shopping list , do people still need to use a pen ?
some do .
registrars of births , deaths and marriages have been recording life 's significant events in their usually impeccable writing since 1837 .
writer 's hand : not a word crossed out in this instance of neil hallows ' writing " all registrars are conscious that they follow a long and noble tradition , " says ruth hodson , interim registration manager for peterborough city council .
but even their fountain pens will soon barely be heard scratching on the registers .
under a modernisation programme , an increasing amount of the information is being entered directly on to a computer .
ms hodson is unsentimental .
" if everything we do still had to be done by hand , there would not be enough hours in the day . "
but perhaps handwriting gains its greatest importance when it is least legible .
the reputation of doctors for scrawling was enhanced by a study in the british medical journal which found medics ' writing was considerably worse than other healthcare workers or administrative staff .
poor writing has often been blamed for medication errors .
gwyn williams , a junior doctor in carmarthen , says that despite technological advances , a great deal of clinical communication is still handwritten .
remember this ?
" we have to write so much , on so many occasions , with the clock ticking .
the end result is so difficult to interpret that even i have to concentrate on occasions to work out what -lsb- i have written -rsb- .
" there does n't seem to be any other logical way of doing it .
typing clinical notes on a computer seems so cumbersome in the limited time available that i ca n't see how it would work . "
in many jobs though , a person can go for months , even years , writing only the odd phone message in their own script .
nevertheless , some employers still ask for a handwritten application , or a sample of writing , although the chartered institute of personnel and development warns employers they need to be clear about the reason for that , to avoid accusations of discrimination .
10-page letters there are those who see handwriting 's slip in educational priority and increasingly eccentric role in the workplace as evidence that , in the west at least , we are forgetting an ancient art form .
a panic , perhaps , and one witnessed every time the dominant style of writing changed or a new form of technology seemed to threaten it .
an early typewriter led the scientific american in 1867 to marvel that " the weary process of learning penmanship in schools will be reduced to -lsb- writing -rsb- one 's own signature and playing on the literary piano " .
maybe a couple of times a week -lsb- pupils -rsb- could produce something handwritten that is judged partly on its legibility , or even its beauty kitty burns florey but look at the decline in letter writing .
the students i knew two decades ago who knocked out 10-page letters during a morning in bed have probably not yet written 10 pages of handwritten prose of any kind this year .
for ms florey , the answer should start in the classroom .
not a return to the nuns with sticks , but for children to value handwriting by learning a simple , legible , attractive script from the start - in her view a form of italic - and then keep reinforcing it beyond the early years .
" maybe a couple of times a week -lsb- pupils -rsb- could produce something handwritten that is judged partly on its legibility , or even its beauty . "
adults too can improve their writing , in a matter of weeks with a textbook and expert advice .
apple co-founder steve jobs has said that if he had not taken a calligraphy course at college , he would not have thought of putting multiple typefaces on the mac .
perhaps the best argument for keeping our pens is that otherwise , in a society that is recorded in more detail than any which came before it , we will leave plenty of data but very little of our personalities behind .
our descendants may struggle to read our letters , but they 'll never even see most of our texts and e-mails .
show us your handwriting 1 .
here are three examples of handwriting , courtesy of the magazine team -lrb- in ascending order of readability -rrb- 2 .

my handwriting deteriorated appallingly as i began to use computers almost exclusively for communication .
the pda i use has a stylus and is supposed to be able to learn and translate handwriting , but it , -lrb- quite understandably -rrb- , fails to translate anything i write .
i experimented last year and found that it was possible to write with a fountain pen if i concentrated exclusively upon forming the letters and keeping on a straight line , and felt some pride at my achievement .
if modern life were not so frantic and noisy , i daresay i could sit for an hour each day and write my journals in ink , but is it worth it ?
where 's the cut and paste , where 's the ability to search through months and years of notes for a phrase ?
nobody washes their clothes by hand anymore either .
should that too be taught in schools ?

tony dicker , from cardiff , jumped on a bike for the first time in decades to take part in the enduro india ride .
mr dicker badly sprained a thumb after a fall but was soon back in the saddle of his royal enfield bullet motorcycle .
he even had his hair and beard shaved off during the 1,200-mile challenge to raise extra funds for a cancer charity .
mr dicker 's wife anne died from the disease in 2003 so cancer care cymru was one of the charities that benefited from his journey .
the enduro india runs from goa to cochin in the south of the country and features mountains , cities , tea plantations , national parks and even a wildlife sanctuary . "
it 's just a wonderful , wonderful experience " tony dicker temperatures can reach 32c -lrb- 90f -rrb- and sections of the ride are extremely difficult with numerous hairpin bends .
the demanding route means many participants suffer at least one fall and mr dicker was no exception .
" i hit some sand on a corner and i think my front wheel skidded .
i was taken for an x-ray the next day but it was just badly sprained , " he said .
mr dicker was given a splint and , although the injury meant missing a section of the ride , he was soon back on the road .
he said the event was a fantastic experience , and he particularly enjoyed the warmth of the indian people .
" i had never been to india before and i found it fascinating .
the people were just wonderful , " he said .
" looking at the people and their way of life and the wonderful friendliness we experienced everywhere , it changed me .
" i would say the vast majority of people in india have far less than people in the western world , but the vast majority of indians are far happier than people in britain that want , want , want . "
distinctive beard mr dicker raised £ 4,500 for cancer care cymru and £ 2,000 for the event 's four charities , but he unexpectedly raised even more cash during the celebration dinner on the final evening .
one of the marshals asked mr dicker if he had thought about having his distinctive beard shaved off for charity .
" he said ' how much do you want ' and i said ' about £ 150 or £ 200 ' , " said mr dicker .
" he asked about my hair too , which had taken me about three years to grow - it was below my shoulders - and i said ' about £ 500 ' . "
the shaving of his hair and beard eventually raised about £ 2,000 at the dinner as fellow riders pitched in with cash .
mr dicker , who stayed in india for a further two weeks after the ride with his partner jan ward , said he loved the country so much , he wanted to return .
" it 's just a wonderful , wonderful experience .
i plan to go back in 2011 with jan but not to ride the bike this time ! " he said .

" i would say the vast majority of people in india have far less than people in the western world , but the vast majority of indians are far happier than people in britain that want , want , want . "
distinctive beard mr dicker raised £ 4,500 for cancer care cymru and £ 2,000 for the event 's four charities , but he unexpectedly raised even more cash during the celebration dinner on the final evening .
one of the marshals asked mr dicker if he had thought about having his distinctive beard shaved off for charity .
" he said ' how much do you want ' and i said ' about £ 150 or £ 200 ' , " said mr dicker .
" he asked about my hair too , which had taken me about three years to grow - it was below my shoulders - and i said ' about £ 500 ' . "
the shaving of his hair and beard eventually raised about £ 2,000 at the dinner as fellow riders pitched in with cash .
mr dicker , who stayed in india for a further two weeks after the ride with his partner jan ward , said he loved the country so much , he wanted to return .
" it 's just a wonderful , wonderful experience .
i plan to go back in 2011 with jan but not to ride the bike this time ! " he said .

tony dicker , from cardiff , jumped on a bike for the first time in decades to take part in the enduro india ride .
mr dicker badly sprained a thumb after a fall but was soon back in the saddle of his royal enfield bullet motorcycle .
he even had his hair and beard shaved off during the 1,200-mile challenge to raise extra funds for a cancer charity .
mr dicker 's wife anne died from the disease in 2003 so cancer care cymru was one of the charities that benefited from his journey .
the enduro india runs from goa to cochin in the south of the country and features mountains , cities , tea plantations , national parks and even a wildlife sanctuary .
it 's just a wonderful , wonderful experience tony dicker temperatures can reach 32c -lrb- 90f -rrb- and sections of the ride are extremely difficult with numerous hairpin bends .
the demanding route means many participants suffer at least one fall and mr dicker was no exception .
" i hit some sand on a corner and i think my front wheel skidded .
i was taken for an x-ray the next day but it was just badly sprained , " he said .
mr dicker was given a splint and , although the injury meant missing a section of the ride , he was soon back on the road .
he said the event was a fantastic experience , and he particularly enjoyed the warmth of the indian people .
" i had never been to india before and i found it fascinating .

cabinet appointments remain subject to vetting and senate confirmation .
secretary of state : hillary clinton defence secretary : robert gates treasury secretary : timothy geithner health secretary : vacant attorney general -lrb- justice secretary -rrb- : eric holder homeland security secretary : janet napolitano un ambassador : susan rice energy secretary : steven chu epa administrator -lrb- environment secretary -rrb- : lisa jackson housing secretary : shaun donovan education secretary : arne duncan interior secretary : ken salazar agriculture secretary : tom vilsack cia director : leon panetta commerce secretary : gary locke secretary of state : hillary clinton mrs clinton , first lady from 1993 to 2001 , lost a close race against mr obama for the democratic party 's presidential nomination .
she will now have to step down as senator for new york .
mrs clinton will be able to hit the ground running , given her wide experience and international contacts .
mr obama and mrs clinton clashed on some foreign policy issues during the primary campaign , and with incoming vice-president joseph biden also well-versed in foreign policy , there is scope for friction within the obama team .
mr obama has also decided to give his ambassador to the un , susan rice , a seat in the cabinet .
full profile : hillary rodham clinton return to top defence secretary : robert gates us defence secretary robert gates will remain in charge of the pentagon when barack obama takes office , at least for the first year of his administration .
robert gates , 65 , is a former director of the cia and was appointed defence secretary by president bush in 2006 .
he has promoted the military surge in iraq that has been credited with stemming violence there .
mr obama opposed the surge but both men are agreed on a greater focus on afghanistan .
mr gates is seen as a moderate and is widely respected among both democrats and republicans in congress .
his appointment would also fulfil mr obama 's pledge to include a republican in his cabinet .
full profile : robert gates return to top treasury secretary : timothy geithner the 47-year-old head of the federal reserve bank of new york , timothy geithner , was instrumental in shaping the us government 's response to the banking crisis .
he played a pivotal role in the intense negotiations which took place before lehman brothers went bankrupt , and also helped forge the deals involving aig and jp morgan .
he regularly speaks about the need for major reforms in the financial system in order to avoid further turbulence .
before joining the federal reserve of new york , timothy geithner worked for the international monetary fund .
he was also the treasury 's under-secretary for international affairs from 1999 to 2001 .
full profile : timothy geithner return to top health secretary : vacant this post is still to be filled after former senator tom daschle withdrew his nomination on 3 february following revelations that he had failed to pay some $ 130,000 in taxes .
reforms to the us healthcare system are likely to be one of the top domestic priorities of the obama administration .
return to top attorney general : eric holder eric holder occupied the number two position in the justice department in bill clinton 's administration .
he was a senior legal adviser to mr obama 's campaign team and co-chaired the vice-presidential selection committee .
if confirmed , he would lead the administration 's efforts to close the guantanamo bay prison camp , a move mr obama has singled out as a priority .
mr holder , 57 , would be the first african-american to occupy the position of attorney general .
one issue that may surface during confirmation hearings is mr holder 's controversial advice on pardons to president clinton in 2000 , on the last day of his administration .
mr holder told the outgoing president that he was " neutral , leaning towards favourable " about pardoning fugitive financier marc rich .
return to top homeland security : janet napolitano arizona governor janet napolitano has been picked for the post of secretary of the department of homeland security .
this post was created in the wake of the 11 september 2001 attacks .
as a governor of a state bordering mexico , gov napolitano has wide experience on immigration issues .
she served as us attorney for arizona and was also state attorney general .
full profile : janet napolitano return to top un ambassador : susan rice barack obama 's un ambassador , susan rice , will hold cabinet rank , in a sign of mr obama 's plan to work more closely with un member states than the administration of george w bush has over the last eight years .
ms rice worked in the clinton administration from 1997 to 2001 but backed mr obama for the democratic nomination because of his opposition to the iraq war .
she is also an advocate of tough action to end the killing in darfur .
testifying before the senate foreign relations committee in april 2007 , she supported the idea of military action to force the sudanese government to halt the massacres .
full profile : susan rice return to top energy secretary : steven chu barack obama has picked leading scientist dr steven chu as his energy secretary .
dr chu is the director of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , which pioneers work to find scientific solutions to global warming .
in 1997 , he shared the nobel prize for physics for his research into supercooled atoms .
as energy secretary , he will have responsibility for maintaining america 's stockpile of nuclear arms , and for modernising its electrical supply grid .
he will also be able to direct efforts to find alternative energy sources .
full profile : steven chu return to top epa administrator : lisa jackson lisa jackson will head the environmental protection agency under mr obama .
she worked for the epa under bill clinton in the 1990s , before moving to the new jersey department of environmental protection , first as an officer and then , in 2006 , as its head .
she was recently picked by new jersey governor jon corzine to be his chief of staff .
she would be the first african-american epa administrator .
return to top housing secretary : shaun donovan mr obama used his weekly radio address on 13 december to announce he had chosen shaun donovan as secretary of housing and urban development - the department that helps provide affordable housing to americans .
mr donovan , a harvard-educated architect , is currently new york city commissioner of housing preservation and development .
in that role - which he has held since 2004 - mr donovan has managed a $ 7.5bn plan designed to put a half-million new yorkers in affordable housing by 2013 .
during the clinton administration , mr donovan was deputy assistant secretary for multi-family housing at the department he is now to head .
return to top education secretary : arne duncan arne duncan has been in charge of chicago 's public schools system since 2001 , so barack obama - as a senator from illinois - has had plenty of opportunities to study his work close up .
the windy city 's schools have improved on his watch , with sat results improving , and a number of failing schools closed or overhauled .
he is well-liked by teachers , despite his embrace of some of the education reforms that teachers ' unions oppose .
mr obama hinted at support for some of these reforms - like merit pay and charter schools - on the campaign trail , and mr duncan 's popularity within the education community may be an asset if the incoming president wants to change america 's schools .
return to top interior secretary : ken salazar interior secretaries - with their responsibility for overseeing the lease of drilling rights to energy companies - often hail from the mineral-rich mountain west , and mr obama 's first pick for the job is no exception .
ken salazar has been a colorado senator since 2004 , before which he served as the state 's attorney general .
environmentalists have raised eyebrows at some of his ties to oil and farming lobbyists , but mr salazar voted against oil drilling in alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge .
he is mr obama 's second hispanic cabinet pick , after commerce secretary bill richardson .
return to top agriculture secretary : tom vilsack tom vilsack , as a former governor of the agricultural state of iowa , is no stranger to farming .
indeed , some environmentalists have expressed concern that he is too friendly with the farming lobby and therefore unlikely to reform america 's heavily subsidised agricultural sector .
mr vilsack will be the fourth of mr obama 's former rivals for the democratic party 's 2008 preseidential nomination to join his inner circle , after joe biden , hillary clinton and bill richardson .
mr vilsack embarked on a brief presidential run in 2007 , but dropped out before the first selection contests .
he endorsed hillary clinton in the primaries .
return to top cia director : leon panetta former clinton white house chief of staff leon panetta is set to to head the cia , according to democratic officials .
mr panetta , 70 , has little direct experience in intelligence matters and may face a tough confirmation hearing on that account .
but he is regarded as a good manager who knows government operations well .
he was chief of staff from 1994 to 1997 , headed the office of management and budget , is a former eight-term member of congress , and most recently was a member of the iraq study group .
mr panetta has publicly criticised the cia 's harsh interrogation methods , such as waterboarding .
he would report directly to the director of national intelligence .
former navy admiral dennis blair is mr obama 's choice for this post , reports say .
return to top commerce secretary : gary locke former washington state governor gary locke is president obama 's third choice commerce secretary after his first two picks - bill richardson and judd gregg - withdrew their names from consideration .
mr locke was the first chinese-american governor of any us state , and if his nomination is approved , he would be the third asian-american member of mr obama 's cabinet .
he will bring his experience as a governor to the commerce department , which has oversight over the telecommunications industry , and responsibility for promoting economic development .

full profile : robert gates return to top treasury secretary : timothy geithner the 47-year-old head of the federal reserve bank of new york , timothy geithner , was instrumental in shaping the us government 's response to the banking crisis .
he played a pivotal role in the intense negotiations which took place before lehman brothers went bankrupt , and also helped forge the deals involving aig and jp morgan .
he regularly speaks about the need for major reforms in the financial system in order to avoid further turbulence .
before joining the federal reserve of new york , timothy geithner worked for the international monetary fund .
he was also the treasury 's under-secretary for international affairs from 1999 to 2001 .
full profile : timothy geithner return to top health secretary : vacant this post is still to be filled after former senator tom daschle withdrew his nomination on 3 february following revelations that he had failed to pay some $ 130,000 in taxes .
reforms to the us healthcare system are likely to be one of the top domestic priorities of the obama administration .
return to top attorney general : eric holder eric holder occupied the number two position in the justice department in bill clinton 's administration .
he was a senior legal adviser to mr obama 's campaign team and co-chaired the vice-presidential selection committee .
if confirmed , he would lead the administration 's efforts to close the guantanamo bay prison camp , a move mr obama has singled out as a priority .
mr holder , 57 , would be the first african-american to occupy the position of attorney general .
one issue that may surface during confirmation hearings is mr holder 's controversial advice on pardons to president clinton in 2000 , on the last day of his administration .
mr holder told the outgoing president that he was " neutral , leaning towards favourable " about pardoning fugitive financier marc rich .
return to top homeland security : janet napolitano arizona governor janet napolitano has been picked for the post of secretary of the department of homeland security .
this post was created in the wake of the 11 september 2001 attacks .
as a governor of a state bordering mexico , gov napolitano has wide experience on immigration issues .
she served as us attorney for arizona and was also state attorney general .
full profile : janet napolitano return to top un ambassador : susan rice barack obama 's un ambassador , susan rice , will hold cabinet rank , in a sign of mr obama 's plan to work more closely with un member states than the administration of george w bush has over the last eight years .
ms rice worked in the clinton administration from 1997 to 2001 but backed mr obama for the democratic nomination because of his opposition to the iraq war .
she is also an advocate of tough action to end the killing in darfur .
testifying before the senate foreign relations committee in april 2007 , she supported the idea of military action to force the sudanese government to halt the massacres .
full profile : susan rice return to top energy secretary : steven chu barack obama has picked leading scientist dr steven chu as his energy secretary .
dr chu is the director of the lawrence berkeley national laboratory , which pioneers work to find scientific solutions to global warming .
in 1997 , he shared the nobel prize for physics for his research into supercooled atoms .
as energy secretary , he will have responsibility for maintaining america 's stockpile of nuclear arms , and for modernising its electrical supply grid .
he will also be able to direct efforts to find alternative energy sources .
full profile : steven chu return to top epa administrator : lisa jackson lisa jackson will head the environmental protection agency under mr obama .
she worked for the epa under bill clinton in the 1990s , before moving to the new jersey department of environmental protection , first as an officer and then , in 2006 , as its head .
she was recently picked by new jersey governor jon corzine to be his chief of staff .
she would be the first african-american epa administrator .
return to top housing secretary : shaun donovan mr obama used his weekly radio address on 13 december to announce he had chosen shaun donovan as secretary of housing and urban development - the department that helps provide affordable housing to americans .
mr donovan , a harvard-educated architect , is currently new york city commissioner of housing preservation and development .
in that role - which he has held since 2004 - mr donovan has managed a $ 7.5bn plan designed to put a half-million new yorkers in affordable housing by 2013 .
during the clinton administration , mr donovan was deputy assistant secretary for multi-family housing at the department he is now to head .
return to top education secretary : arne duncan arne duncan has been in charge of chicago 's public schools system since 2001 , so barack obama - as a senator from illinois - has had plenty of opportunities to study his work close up .
the windy city 's schools have improved on his watch , with sat results improving , and a number of failing schools closed or overhauled .
he is well-liked by teachers , despite his embrace of some of the education reforms that teachers ' unions oppose .
mr obama hinted at support for some of these reforms - like merit pay and charter schools - on the campaign trail , and mr duncan 's popularity within the education community may be an asset if the incoming president wants to change america 's schools .
return to top interior secretary : ken salazar interior secretaries - with their responsibility for overseeing the lease of drilling rights to energy companies - often hail from the mineral-rich mountain west , and mr obama 's first pick for the job is no exception .
ken salazar has been a colorado senator since 2004 , before which he served as the state 's attorney general .
environmentalists have raised eyebrows at some of his ties to oil and farming lobbyists , but mr salazar voted against oil drilling in alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge .
he is mr obama 's second hispanic cabinet pick , after commerce secretary bill richardson .
return to top agriculture secretary : tom vilsack tom vilsack , as a former governor of the agricultural state of iowa , is no stranger to farming .
indeed , some environmentalists have expressed concern that he is too friendly with the farming lobby and therefore unlikely to reform america 's heavily subsidised agricultural sector .
mr vilsack will be the fourth of mr obama 's former rivals for the democratic party 's 2008 preseidential nomination to join his inner circle , after joe biden , hillary clinton and bill richardson .
mr vilsack embarked on a brief presidential run in 2007 , but dropped out before the first selection contests .
he endorsed hillary clinton in the primaries .
return to top cia director : leon panetta former clinton white house chief of staff leon panetta is set to to head the cia , according to democratic officials .
mr panetta , 70 , has little direct experience in intelligence matters and may face a tough confirmation hearing on that account .
but he is regarded as a good manager who knows government operations well .
he was chief of staff from 1994 to 1997 , headed the office of management and budget , is a former eight-term member of congress , and most recently was a member of the iraq study group .
mr panetta has publicly criticised the cia 's harsh interrogation methods , such as waterboarding .
he would report directly to the director of national intelligence .
former navy admiral dennis blair is mr obama 's choice for this post , reports say .
return to top commerce secretary : gary locke former washington state governor gary locke is president obama 's third choice commerce secretary after his first two picks - bill richardson and judd gregg - withdrew their names from consideration .
mr locke was the first chinese-american governor of any us state , and if his nomination is approved , he would be the third asian-american member of mr obama 's cabinet .
he will bring his experience as a governor to the commerce department , which has oversight over the telecommunications industry , and responsibility for promoting economic development .

the wildfowl and wetlands trust -lrb- wwt -rrb- in slimbridge , gloucestershire , began a crane-breeding scheme in 2007 .
the metre-high bird was extinct in the uk for four centuries and now only has a tenuous foothold in britain .
the somerset levels have been identified as the best location to release the cranes when they have matured .
the wwt 's crane-breeding programme involved a crane " school " , in which chicks were raised by keepers wearing crane suits and fed using customised crane head litter pickers to prevent them becoming used to humans .
the new rearing facility will be a scaled-up version of the crane school model .
eggs will be brought from a flourishing wild population in germany and incubated , hatched and hand-reared at slimbridge .
dr debbie pain , wwt 's director of conservation , said : " cranes are magnificent birds that were driven from their wetland habitats and hunted to extinction long ago .
" thanks to lessons learnt in crane school we now have the feathery-fingered skills to raise crane chicks .
" roll on 2010 - we can not wait to begin teaching these amazing birds how to live in british wetlands once again . "
patrick capper , chief executive of taunton-based viridor credits , which provided the grant , said he hoped the project would act as a beacon for conservation activity across the uk .

european elections in june will put the parliament in the spotlight .
in the first of a series of viewpoints on eu issues , lib dem mep chris davies explains why he is pressing for more transparency . "
preparations for the next european elections coincide with another row about meps ' expenses .
it was ever thus , not that repetition makes it any better .
bankers may currently occupy the prime slot as the public 's hate figures , but revelations that meps could add £ 1m to their family income over a five-year term suggest that we are strong challengers for the role .
it does n't have to be like this .
an mep 's salaries budget -lrb- £ 145,000 annually -rrb- can be used entirely to pay the salaries of staff .
the office budget -lrb- £ 36,000 -rrb- can be used entirely to pay the expenses of running an office .
even the ludicrously large sums handed over automatically for travel expenses that bear no relation to the actual cost of tickets can be handed back , although i have never done so myself .
-lrb- handing back money goes against the grain , so my own invented code of conscience has been to use it for charitable and political donations , rather than stuffing it into my back pocket . -rrb-
birthday present but the european parliament 's rules are n't designed to encourage an approach to the use of taxpayers ' money that meps would themselves expect of any other public body .
if you really do n't give a damn the system is open to abuse .
there is nothing to say that a member ca n't pay his spouse a salary equivalent to the entire budget . "
such curbs on perks as are being introduced will apply only to new members rather than existing ones - turkeys do n't vote for christmas ! "
mep expenses ' can reach £ 1m ' there is no requirement to produce any receipts to justify use of the office budget .
a signature to support a claim for the daily brussels subsistence allowance -lrb- £ 266 -rrb- does n't guarantee that any work is done .
and the travel allowance ?
well , it can be like a birthday present that arrives every week .
maybe i am too cynical .
the other week i asked a romanian mep what he did with his salaries budget .
" i only have two employees so i hand the rest back , " he said .
" you hand it back ? "
i questioned incredulously , not being sure whether i was more astonished by his honesty or by the fact that a politician could n't put to use all the money available to help promote his political agenda .
the trouble is , you just do n't know who is cheating and who is not .
secret my reforming colleagues tell me that improvements are on the way .
after the elections in june , travel expenses will be paid at actual cost , although with some extra allowances added .
assistants employed in brussels will be paid directly by the parliament , although not those working elsewhere .
there will still be no requirement to produce receipts for office expenditure , and such curbs on perks as are being introduced will apply only to new members rather than existing ones - turkeys do n't vote for christmas !
critics will still have plenty of scope for complaint , and with good reason ; that a majority of meps have voted to keep secret the results of future auditors ' investigations does not bode well .
there is another aspect of european parliament procedures that should also arouse concern , one relevant to the abuse of power rather than the abuse of expenses .
the parliament is far from toothless .
it may revise proposals for eu legislation rather than initiate them , but it has co-decision powers equal to the council of ministers .
with no executive body to insist upon a line to be followed , and with the freedom to forge cross-party alliances , individual meps can have a great deal more legislative influence than their counterparts at westminster .
their actions can change the law of the land in 27 countries , not just one , and the lobbyists know this very well indeed .
could do better first point of call for anyone seeking to know whether a parliamentarian has a financial interest that may sway a vote will be the register of interests .
procedures in brussels trail a long way behind those now established at westminster .
yes , a register is maintained , is available for public inspection in the parliament , and has to be updated annually .
entries are also published online , subject to the meps concerned having given their permission .
but this weakness is hardly relevant , for the gaping flaw in the european parliament rules is that no requirements whatsoever are imposed as to the content of the declarations to be made .
the information provided is left entirely to the discretion of each member , and there are no penalties for omission .
successive scandals have promoted reform in house of commons procedures .
they will have less influence over the european parliament unless the flames of public outrage are fanned simultaneously in a significant number of member states .
even then , national practices vary so greatly that what may be regarded as unacceptable in one may be greeted with stoic indifference in another .
by comparison with the italian parliament the european body is perhaps not doing too badly .
it would be nice to hope that we could do better , and that the european parliament could set standards of best practice by which others legislatures would be judged .
on current performance i am not sure that such hopes will ever be realised . "

" you hand it back ? "
i questioned incredulously , not being sure whether i was more astonished by his honesty or by the fact that a politician could n't put to use all the money available to help promote his political agenda .
the trouble is , you just do n't know who is cheating and who is not .

after the elections in june , travel expenses will be paid at actual cost , although with some extra allowances added .
assistants employed in brussels will be paid directly by the parliament , although not those working elsewhere .

it may revise proposals for eu legislation rather than initiate them , but it has co-decision powers equal to the council of ministers .
with no executive body to insist upon a line to be followed , and with the freedom to forge cross-party alliances , individual meps can have a great deal more legislative influence than their counterparts at westminster .
their actions can change the law of the land in 27 countries , not just one , and the lobbyists know this very well indeed .

procedures in brussels trail a long way behind those now established at westminster .
yes , a register is maintained , is available for public inspection in the parliament , and has to be updated annually .
entries are also published online , subject to the meps concerned having given their permission .
but this weakness is hardly relevant , for the gaping flaw in the european parliament rules is that no requirements whatsoever are imposed as to the content of the declarations to be made .
the information provided is left entirely to the discretion of each member , and there are no penalties for omission .
successive scandals have promoted reform in house of commons procedures .
they will have less influence over the european parliament unless the flames of public outrage are fanned simultaneously in a significant number of member states .
even then , national practices vary so greatly that what may be regarded as unacceptable in one may be greeted with stoic indifference in another .
by comparison with the italian parliament the european body is perhaps not doing too badly .
it would be nice to hope that we could do better , and that the european parliament could set standards of best practice by which others legislatures would be judged .
on current performance i am not sure that such hopes will ever be realised .

european elections in june will put the parliament in the spotlight .
chris davies is liberal democrat mep for the north-west of england in the first of a series of viewpoints on eu issues , lib dem mep chris davies explains why he is pressing for more transparency .
preparations for the next european elections coincide with another row about meps ' expenses .
it was ever thus , not that repetition makes it any better .
bankers may currently occupy the prime slot as the public 's hate figures , but revelations that meps could add £ 1m to their family income over a five-year term suggest that we are strong challengers for the role .
it does n't have to be like this .
an mep 's salaries budget -lrb- £ 145,000 annually -rrb- can be used entirely to pay the salaries of staff .
the office budget -lrb- £ 36,000 -rrb- can be used entirely to pay the expenses of running an office .
even the ludicrously large sums handed over automatically for travel expenses that bear no relation to the actual cost of tickets can be handed back , although i have never done so myself .
-lrb- handing back money goes against the grain , so my own invented code of conscience has been to use it for charitable and political donations , rather than stuffing it into my back pocket . -rrb-
birthday present but the european parliament 's rules are n't designed to encourage an approach to the use of taxpayers ' money that meps would themselves expect of any other public body .
if you really do n't give a damn the system is open to abuse .
there is nothing to say that a member ca n't pay his spouse a salary equivalent to the entire budget .
such curbs on perks as are being introduced will apply only to new members rather than existing ones - turkeys do n't vote for christmas !
mep expenses ' can reach £ 1m ' there is no requirement to produce any receipts to justify use of the office budget .
a signature to support a claim for the daily brussels subsistence allowance -lrb- £ 266 -rrb- does n't guarantee that any work is done .
and the travel allowance ?
well , it can be like a birthday present that arrives every week .
maybe i am too cynical .
the other week i asked a romanian mep what he did with his salaries budget .
" i only have two employees so i hand the rest back , " he said .
" you hand it back ? "
i questioned incredulously , not being sure whether i was more astonished by his honesty or by the fact that a politician could n't put to use all the money available to help promote his political agenda .
the trouble is , you just do n't know who is cheating and who is not .
secret my reforming colleagues tell me that improvements are on the way .
after the elections in june , travel expenses will be paid at actual cost , although with some extra allowances added .
assistants employed in brussels will be paid directly by the parliament , although not those working elsewhere .
each month meps and their staff move to strasbourg for full sessions there will still be no requirement to produce receipts for office expenditure , and such curbs on perks as are being introduced will apply only to new members rather than existing ones - turkeys do n't vote for christmas !
critics will still have plenty of scope for complaint , and with good reason ; that a majority of meps have voted to keep secret the results of future auditors ' investigations does not bode well .
there is another aspect of european parliament procedures that should also arouse concern , one relevant to the abuse of power rather than the abuse of expenses .
the parliament is far from toothless .
it may revise proposals for eu legislation rather than initiate them , but it has co-decision powers equal to the council of ministers .
with no executive body to insist upon a line to be followed , and with the freedom to forge cross-party alliances , individual meps can have a great deal more legislative influence than their counterparts at westminster .
their actions can change the law of the land in 27 countries , not just one , and the lobbyists know this very well indeed .
could do better first point of call for anyone seeking to know whether a parliamentarian has a financial interest that may sway a vote will be the register of interests .
procedures in brussels trail a long way behind those now established at westminster .
yes , a register is maintained , is available for public inspection in the parliament , and has to be updated annually .
entries are also published online , subject to the meps concerned having given their permission .
but this weakness is hardly relevant , for the gaping flaw in the european parliament rules is that no requirements whatsoever are imposed as to the content of the declarations to be made .
the information provided is left entirely to the discretion of each member , and there are no penalties for omission .
successive scandals have promoted reform in house of commons procedures .
they will have less influence over the european parliament unless the flames of public outrage are fanned simultaneously in a significant number of member states .
even then , national practices vary so greatly that what may be regarded as unacceptable in one may be greeted with stoic indifference in another .
by comparison with the italian parliament the european body is perhaps not doing too badly .
it would be nice to hope that we could do better , and that the european parliament could set standards of best practice by which others legislatures would be judged .
on current performance i am not sure that such hopes will ever be realised .

your cv is your shop window the first thing you have to remember when you are working on your cv is that this might be your one and only chance to sell yourself to your prospective employer .
when you write your cv , it is just a document , but when you send it out it becomes your sales brochure .
the employer is probably going to be wading through hundreds of cvs so you need to make yours easy to read , interesting , and memorable .
here are some ways to achieve that .
what to put into your cv try to keep your cv short .
if you can get it down to a page or two , then it is going to be much easier for the employer to read .
some pieces of information are vital .
make sure you include all your contact details , your career history and a good section on your relevant skills and strengths .
in addition , make sure you write a few lines introducing yourself and tell the reader what your career ambitions are .
your covering letter will explain why you are applying for the role , but it is good to outline where you want to be and how your experience fits into that .
write a few bullet points with your success and achievements for each job you have had , such as winning major accounts or exceeding key targets .
if you have worked for one employer for several years in a number of different positions , group them all under one title in order to keep it brief .
so for example , if you worked for one retailer for 10 years as a shop assistant and then as a stock manager and then as a store manager ; block this whole section down under one title and explain the various roles you held underneath .
this will help you to pare down the amount information you are including .
what not to put in do not include lots of irrelevant information .
no one wants to wade through pages of details on your primary school education .
and there 's no need to include all your interests - unless they are relevant .
if you are applying for a job as a walking tour guide in a library it is good to know that you read a lot and you enjoy walking ; but if you are applying for a job as a sales manager , it is less relevant .
sending out your cv when you write your covering letter to accompany your cv , i advise you to do your research .
you should always include information about the company that you are applying to .
you need to write something like , " dear mr blogs , i understand you are looking for someone to fill such and such a position .
your organisation is one that i 've always been very impressed with and i 've admired .
i understand the business was established 20 years ago and you operate in 50 countries . "
information like this can be found really easily on any company website , and it will make your covering letter come alive .
another important point is to spell check your letter and cv .
in fact , i would recommend that you check it , check it and re-check it and then get someone one else to check it too .
do not send out your cv with spelling or punctuation errors in it .
if i am wading through 200 cvs for one job , the easiest way to discard cvs at a first pass is if they contain errors .
when you are printing your cv and letter , print them on the best quality paper you can afford .
it helps to improve that all-important first impression .
and do print and post your cv , do not email it .
nowadays , 90 % of job applications are sent by email .
when i get a cv in the post , i am much more likely to read it , because it seems more personal .
how to get that job obviously , your skills and experience are of the utmost importance when you go for a job , but ultimately companies are employing people , not skills .
when you go for your interview you need to be positive , dynamic and interesting .
one of the key ways to demonstrate this is to do your research .
one of the most memorable interviews i ever had was when a man came in and quizzed me about something that had happened in my company 10 years earlier .
it put me on the spot , but it made me realise that this guy knew what he was talking about .
and more than that , he showed me that he cared about the job opportunity enough to do his homework .
finally , dress appropriately .
when in doubt look smart .
no one ever got marked down for wearing a suit , but you can lose credibility if you have n't made an effort with your appearance .
if you show your prospective employer that you care about this opportunity then you are much more likely to get the job .

your cv is your shop window the first thing you have to remember when you are working on your cv is that this might be your one and only chance to sell yourself to your prospective employer .
when you write your cv , it is just a document , but when you send it out it becomes your sales brochure .
the employer is probably going to be wading through hundreds of cvs so you need to make yours easy to read , interesting , and memorable .
here are some ways to achieve that .
what to put into your cv try to keep your cv short .
if you can get it down to a page or two , then it is going to be much easier for the employer to read .
some pieces of information are vital .
make sure you include all your contact details , your career history and a good section on your relevant skills and strengths .
in addition , make sure you write a few lines introducing yourself and tell the reader what your career ambitions are .
your covering letter will explain why you are applying for the role , but it is good to outline where you want to be and how your experience fits into that .
write a few bullet points with your success and achievements for each job you have had , such as winning major accounts or exceeding key targets .
if you have worked for one employer for several years in a number of different positions , group them all under one title in order to keep it brief .
so for example , if you worked for one retailer for 10 years as a shop assistant and then as a stock manager and then as a store manager ; block this whole section down under one title and explain the various roles you held underneath .
this will help you to pare down the amount information you are including .
what not to put in do not include lots of irrelevant information .
no one wants to wade through pages of details on your primary school education .
and there 's no need to include all your interests - unless they are relevant .
if you are applying for a job as a walking tour guide in a library it is good to know that you read a lot and you enjoy walking ; but if you are applying for a job as a sales manager , it is less relevant .
sending out your cv when you write your covering letter to accompany your cv , i advise you to do your research .
you should always include information about the company that you are applying to .
you need to write something like , " dear mr blogs , i understand you are looking for someone to fill such and such a position .
your organisation is one that i 've always been very impressed with and i 've admired .
i understand the business was established 20 years ago and you operate in 50 countries . "
information like this can be found really easily on any company website , and it will make your covering letter come alive .
another important point is to spell check your letter and cv .
in fact , i would recommend that you check it , check it and re-check it and then get someone one else to check it too .
do not send out your cv with spelling or punctuation errors in it .
if i am wading through 200 cvs for one job , the easiest way to discard cvs at a first pass is if they contain errors .
when you are printing your cv and letter , print them on the best quality paper you can afford .
it helps to improve that all-important first impression .
and do print and post your cv , do not email it .
nowadays , 90 % of job applications are sent by email .
when i get a cv in the post , i am much more likely to read it , because it seems more personal .
how to get that job obviously , your skills and experience are of the utmost importance when you go for a job , but ultimately companies are employing people , not skills .
when you go for your interview you need to be positive , dynamic and interesting .
one of the key ways to demonstrate this is to do your research .

by jacqui farnham bbc money programme figures released earlier this month show that unemployment is lurching towards a staggering two million .
what can be done to help the uk 's jobless find work ?
the number of vacancies in the uk has fallen by 76,000 in the last three months .
some employers are cutting up to 75 % of their staff .
as many as 600 applicants are fighting over some jobs .
every day new headlines bring more bad news of job cuts and shrinking businesses and this recession has hit every sector of the economy .
banking to blame the problem started with the banks . "
it is a bit like telling somebody about a death in the family " architect george ferguson when the infamous credit crunch hit , the banks began to fail and inevitably , job losses followed .
since august 2007 , more than 150,000 people have been made redundant from the finance industry .
whilst sympathy may be in short supply for some ex-bankers , there is a big question over what the jobless city worker can do .
given how many people are now fighting over so few city jobs , some are considering a change of career .
and teaching is proving a popular option .
applications for teacher training are up nearly 11 % on last year , according to figures for the last six months released by the training and development agency for schools -lrb- tda -rrb- .
" we 're seeing an unprecedented and sustained rise in enquiries about teaching , " says a delighted graham holley , chief executive of the tda .
" over 1,000 people have visited our ' city seminars ' for those in the financial sector considering teaching . "
this recession may prove to be a boon for the teaching industry but the collapse of banking has set off a domino effect which has clattered through the whole economy .
building industry demolished as trouble brewed in the banks , the construction industry also came under intense pressure .
at one end of the building scale , fewer home owners are adding extensions and loft conversions .
at the other end of the market , big construction projects usually funded by bank loans are being moth-balled .
since late 2007 , the capital required to fund these projects has been hard to find .
architect george ferguson specialises in urban regeneration , and work at his practice in bristol has dropped off sharply .
as a result , he and his fellow directors have taken a pay cut , and they have had to make 10 out of 30 staff redundant .
like most employers , he finds it hard to let members of his team go .
" it is a bit like telling somebody about a death in the family , " mr ferguson says .
" i think it 's important to make people feel appreciated and make them realise that it 's just a matter of who is going to be appropriate for what we are doing now and what we will be doing in the future . "
manufacturing broken down as architects and building companies feel the pinch , pressure also falls on another industry , namely manufacturing . "
people spend their money when they 're reliant on benefits .
they 're not hoarding it away " brendan barber of the tuc once the backbone of the british economy , manufacturing is now seeing its most high pressure squeeze so far , with output falling by 5 % in the last quarter of 2008 .
this sector of the economy is no stranger to the pain of recession .
in the 1980s , the british manufacturing industry took a major hit .
many firms were mired in inefficiency , heavily dependent on government subsidy and prone to frequent striking .
but margaret thatcher changed all that .
she cut subsidies to nationalised companies , confronted the unions and instituted policies which made imported goods far cheaper than home grown products .
companies had to raise their game , or go to the wall .
these days , uk manufacturing firms are amongst the most efficient in europe .
a few months ago , this would have been a source of pride , but right now it is causing heavy job losses because there simply is not room for much more efficiency savings in their processes .
the fall in the value of sterling has helped with exports , but not enough to save jobs .
many manufacturing firms have no choice but to make widespread redundancies .
all shopped out on the high street and as redundancies increase and credit becomes harder to find , the domino effect claims another victim , namely retail .
in this recession people from every economic level have been watching the pennies .
the impact on the high street has been significant .
in the last three months , some 40,000 people have lost their jobs in the retail sector .
almost 30,000 of those were made redundant by high street icon woolworths .
the future for the high street may look bleak , but according to bryan roberts from analysts planet retail there are good signs from some retailers .
" the supermarkets are insulated because people need to eat , " says mr roberts .
" discount brands are doing well .
retailers like primark and aldi tend to thrive in a recession as people trade down in search of value for money . "
pay cuts and short time working whilst job opportunities may exist for retail workers , hundreds of thousands of jobless may be facing longer term unemployment . "
print and post your cv , do not email it " james caan , dragon james caan 's cv workshop so what can be done to help ?
some experts say that one possible solution for cash-strapped businesses may be for some workers to take a pay cut or work fewer hours in order to cut costs .
this can mean that fewer or no job losses result .
bristol architect , george ferguson , took a pay cut in october last year in order to limit the number of redundancies his company would have to make .
he says it is important to keep skilled workers onboard .
" without the proper talent and skills and experience , we 're lost , " says mr ferguson .
" as soon as we let that go , we 're not able to serve our clients properly .
and if we ca n't serve our clients properly then we have n't got a business . "
brendan barber , general secretary of the tuc , agrees that businesses need to think about how they will deal with the upturn when it comes .
" they can struggle if they are faced with skill shortages , so holding on to their workforce can make real economic sense . "
but retaining staff is only one side of the equation .
new positions also have to be created and that could still be difficult long after the " green shoots " of an economic recovery begin to push through .
job protection laws too stringent ?
some businesses claim that the laws that protect employees from unscrupulous employers are too complex and actively put them off taking on new staff . "
companies must do what brings the greatest benefit and the least costs for all concerned " anja schaefer open university blog : what are employees owed ?
in the us , employees have fewer rights than they do in the uk .
some say that when the upturn does come , us employers will respond more quickly than british businesses because they do not have to wade through complex laws when dealing with employees .
ruth lea , former head of policy at the institute of directors , often hears this complaint from small enterprises .
" when i talk to small businesses , one of their big problems is struggling with the employment regulations , " she says .
" i have looked at these in a lot of detail and they are amazingly complex . "
but will hutton of the work foundation says that the laws are not that difficult to work with .
in his opinion , they are actually quite adaptable .
" in britain there is a flexible labour market , " he says .
" it 's one of the things we have built and i 'm strongly in favour of it , but i would n't make it yet more flexible . "
the dole a few years ago , politicians may have thought they had got away from facing difficult debates like these , but now policies on unemployment are at the top of the agenda .
one of the most difficult political hot potatoes around unemployment is the level of jobseekers allowance .
at present it stands at £ 60.50 per week .
according to unemployed draftsman anthony robinson from hull , it does not go very far .
" once you 've paid your gas , electric , water , tv , food , you 've got nothing left , " he says .
" you get the money and by the end of the day you 've spent it paying bills . "
given that it has n't gone up for 10 years , mr barber of the tuc would like to see the dole increased .
" we would like to see it raised by £ 15 , " he says .
" that would bring it into line with what 's happened with earnings in the economy over the last 10 years . "
and he thinks that increasing the dole could help the rest of the economy too .
" all the evidence shows that this is money that gets recycled very quickly into the rest of the economy , " he says .
" people spend their money when they 're reliant on benefits .
they 're not hoarding it away . "
whichever way our politicians look , they are faced with difficult decisions regarding the economy and unemployment .
with jobless figures predicted to rise to three million by the end of the year , they have a tough job on their hands to make their policies work .

by jacqui farnham bbc money programme searching for work can be difficult and depressing figures released earlier this month show that unemployment is lurching towards a staggering two million .
what can be done to help the uk 's jobless find work ?
the number of vacancies in the uk has fallen by 76,000 in the last three months .
some employers are cutting up to 75 % of their staff .
as many as 600 applicants are fighting over some jobs .
every day new headlines bring more bad news of job cuts and shrinking businesses and this recession has hit every sector of the economy .
banking to blame the problem started with the banks .
it is a bit like telling somebody about a death in the family architect george ferguson when the infamous credit crunch hit , the banks began to fail and inevitably , job losses followed .
since august 2007 , more than 150,000 people have been made redundant from the finance industry .
whilst sympathy may be in short supply for some ex-bankers , there is a big question over what the jobless city worker can do .
given how many people are now fighting over so few city jobs , some are considering a change of career .
and teaching is proving a popular option .
applications for teacher training are up nearly 11 % on last year , according to figures for the last six months released by the training and development agency for schools -lrb- tda -rrb- .
" we 're seeing an unprecedented and sustained rise in enquiries about teaching , " says a delighted graham holley , chief executive of the tda .
" over 1,000 people have visited our ' city seminars ' for those in the financial sector considering teaching . "
this recession may prove to be a boon for the teaching industry but the collapse of banking has set off a domino effect which has clattered through the whole economy .
building industry demolished as trouble brewed in the banks , the construction industry also came under intense pressure .
at one end of the building scale , fewer home owners are adding extensions and loft conversions .
unemployment is yet again a politically hot potato at the other end of the market , big construction projects usually funded by bank loans are being moth-balled .
since late 2007 , the capital required to fund these projects has been hard to find .
architect george ferguson specialises in urban regeneration , and work at his practice in bristol has dropped off sharply .
as a result , he and his fellow directors have taken a pay cut , and they have had to make 10 out of 30 staff redundant .
like most employers , he finds it hard to let members of his team go .
" it is a bit like telling somebody about a death in the family , " mr ferguson says .
" i think it 's important to make people feel appreciated and make them realise that it 's just a matter of who is going to be appropriate for what we are doing now and what we will be doing in the future . "
manufacturing broken down as architects and building companies feel the pinch , pressure also falls on another industry , namely manufacturing .
people spend their money when they 're reliant on benefits .
they 're not hoarding it away brendan barber of the tuc once the backbone of the british economy , manufacturing is now seeing its most high pressure squeeze so far , with output falling by 5 % in the last quarter of 2008 .
this sector of the economy is no stranger to the pain of recession .
in the 1980s , the british manufacturing industry took a major hit .
many firms were mired in inefficiency , heavily dependent on government subsidy and prone to frequent striking .
but margaret thatcher changed all that .
she cut subsidies to nationalised companies , confronted the unions and instituted policies which made imported goods far cheaper than home grown products .
companies had to raise their game , or go to the wall .
these days , uk manufacturing firms are amongst the most efficient in europe .
a few months ago , this would have been a source of pride , but right now it is causing heavy job losses because there simply is not room for much more efficiency savings in their processes .
the fall in the value of sterling has helped with exports , but not enough to save jobs .
many manufacturing firms have no choice but to make widespread redundancies .
all shopped out on the high street and as redundancies increase and credit becomes harder to find , the domino effect claims another victim , namely retail .
thatcher transformed the uk corporate sector in this recession people from every economic level have been watching the pennies .
the impact on the high street has been significant .
in the last three months , some 40,000 people have lost their jobs in the retail sector .
almost 30,000 of those were made redundant by high street icon woolworths .
the future for the high street may look bleak , but according to bryan roberts from analysts planet retail there are good signs from some retailers .
" the supermarkets are insulated because people need to eat , " says mr roberts .
" discount brands are doing well .
retailers like primark and aldi tend to thrive in a recession as people trade down in search of value for money . "
pay cuts and short time working whilst job opportunities may exist for retail workers , hundreds of thousands of jobless may be facing longer term unemployment .

some experts say that one possible solution for cash-strapped businesses may be for some workers to take a pay cut or work fewer hours in order to cut costs .
this can mean that fewer or no job losses result .
bristol architect , george ferguson , took a pay cut in october last year in order to limit the number of redundancies his company would have to make .
he says it is important to keep skilled workers onboard .
" without the proper talent and skills and experience , we 're lost , " says mr ferguson .
" as soon as we let that go , we 're not able to serve our clients properly .
and if we ca n't serve our clients properly then we have n't got a business . "
brendan barber , general secretary of the tuc , agrees that businesses need to think about how they will deal with the upturn when it comes .
" they can struggle if they are faced with skill shortages , so holding on to their workforce can make real economic sense . "
but retaining staff is only one side of the equation .
new positions also have to be created and that could still be difficult long after the " green shoots " of an economic recovery begin to push through .
job protection laws too stringent ?
some businesses claim that the laws that protect employees from unscrupulous employers are too complex and actively put them off taking on new staff .
companies must do what brings the greatest benefit and the least costs for all concerned anja schaefer open university blog : what are employees owed ?
in the us , employees have fewer rights than they do in the uk .
some say that when the upturn does come , us employers will respond more quickly than british businesses because they do not have to wade through complex laws when dealing with employees .
ruth lea , former head of policy at the institute of directors , often hears this complaint from small enterprises .
" when i talk to small businesses , one of their big problems is struggling with the employment regulations , " she says .
" i have looked at these in a lot of detail and they are amazingly complex . "
but will hutton of the work foundation says that the laws are not that difficult to work with .
in his opinion , they are actually quite adaptable .
" in britain there is a flexible labour market , " he says .
" it 's one of the things we have built and i 'm strongly in favour of it , but i would n't make it yet more flexible . "
the dole a few years ago , politicians may have thought they had got away from facing difficult debates like these , but now policies on unemployment are at the top of the agenda .
one of the most difficult political hot potatoes around unemployment is the level of jobseekers allowance .
at present it stands at £ 60.50 per week .
according to unemployed draftsman anthony robinson from hull , it does not go very far .
" once you 've paid your gas , electric , water , tv , food , you 've got nothing left , " he says .

in the us , employees have fewer rights than they do in the uk .

by jacqui farnham bbc money programme searching for work can be difficult and depressing figures released earlier this month show that unemployment is lurching towards a staggering two million .
what can be done to help the uk 's jobless find work ?
the number of vacancies in the uk has fallen by 76,000 in the last three months .
some employers are cutting up to 75 % of their staff .
as many as 600 applicants are fighting over some jobs .
every day new headlines bring more bad news of job cuts and shrinking businesses and this recession has hit every sector of the economy .
banking to blame the problem started with the banks .
it is a bit like telling somebody about a death in the family architect george ferguson when the infamous credit crunch hit , the banks began to fail and inevitably , job losses followed .
since august 2007 , more than 150,000 people have been made redundant from the finance industry .
whilst sympathy may be in short supply for some ex-bankers , there is a big question over what the jobless city worker can do .
given how many people are now fighting over so few city jobs , some are considering a change of career .
and teaching is proving a popular option .
applications for teacher training are up nearly 11 % on last year , according to figures for the last six months released by the training and development agency for schools -lrb- tda -rrb- .
" we 're seeing an unprecedented and sustained rise in enquiries about teaching , " says a delighted graham holley , chief executive of the tda .
" over 1,000 people have visited our ' city seminars ' for those in the financial sector considering teaching . "
this recession may prove to be a boon for the teaching industry but the collapse of banking has set off a domino effect which has clattered through the whole economy .
building industry demolished as trouble brewed in the banks , the construction industry also came under intense pressure .
at one end of the building scale , fewer home owners are adding extensions and loft conversions .
unemployment is yet again a politically hot potato at the other end of the market , big construction projects usually funded by bank loans are being moth-balled .
since late 2007 , the capital required to fund these projects has been hard to find .
architect george ferguson specialises in urban regeneration , and work at his practice in bristol has dropped off sharply .
as a result , he and his fellow directors have taken a pay cut , and they have had to make 10 out of 30 staff redundant .
like most employers , he finds it hard to let members of his team go .
" it is a bit like telling somebody about a death in the family , " mr ferguson says .
" i think it 's important to make people feel appreciated and make them realise that it 's just a matter of who is going to be appropriate for what we are doing now and what we will be doing in the future . "
manufacturing broken down as architects and building companies feel the pinch , pressure also falls on another industry , namely manufacturing .
people spend their money when they 're reliant on benefits .
they 're not hoarding it away brendan barber of the tuc once the backbone of the british economy , manufacturing is now seeing its most high pressure squeeze so far , with output falling by 5 % in the last quarter of 2008 .
this sector of the economy is no stranger to the pain of recession .
in the 1980s , the british manufacturing industry took a major hit .
many firms were mired in inefficiency , heavily dependent on government subsidy and prone to frequent striking .
but margaret thatcher changed all that .
she cut subsidies to nationalised companies , confronted the unions and instituted policies which made imported goods far cheaper than home grown products .
companies had to raise their game , or go to the wall .
these days , uk manufacturing firms are amongst the most efficient in europe .
a few months ago , this would have been a source of pride , but right now it is causing heavy job losses because there simply is not room for much more efficiency savings in their processes .
the fall in the value of sterling has helped with exports , but not enough to save jobs .
many manufacturing firms have no choice but to make widespread redundancies .
all shopped out on the high street and as redundancies increase and credit becomes harder to find , the domino effect claims another victim , namely retail .
thatcher transformed the uk corporate sector in this recession people from every economic level have been watching the pennies .
the impact on the high street has been significant .
in the last three months , some 40,000 people have lost their jobs in the retail sector .
almost 30,000 of those were made redundant by high street icon woolworths .
the future for the high street may look bleak , but according to bryan roberts from analysts planet retail there are good signs from some retailers .
" the supermarkets are insulated because people need to eat , " says mr roberts .
" discount brands are doing well .
retailers like primark and aldi tend to thrive in a recession as people trade down in search of value for money . "
pay cuts and short time working whilst job opportunities may exist for retail workers , hundreds of thousands of jobless may be facing longer term unemployment .

some experts say that one possible solution for cash-strapped businesses may be for some workers to take a pay cut or work fewer hours in order to cut costs .
this can mean that fewer or no job losses result .
bristol architect , george ferguson , took a pay cut in october last year in order to limit the number of redundancies his company would have to make .
he says it is important to keep skilled workers onboard .
" without the proper talent and skills and experience , we 're lost , " says mr ferguson .
" as soon as we let that go , we 're not able to serve our clients properly .
and if we ca n't serve our clients properly then we have n't got a business . "
brendan barber , general secretary of the tuc , agrees that businesses need to think about how they will deal with the upturn when it comes .
" they can struggle if they are faced with skill shortages , so holding on to their workforce can make real economic sense . "
but retaining staff is only one side of the equation .
new positions also have to be created and that could still be difficult long after the " green shoots " of an economic recovery begin to push through .

its capital , quito , once a part of the inca empire , has some of the best-preserved early colonial architecture on the continent .
traditionally a farming country , ecuador 's economy was transformed after the 1960s by the growth of industry and the discovery of oil .
there was rapid growth and progress in health , education and housing .
overview overview facts leaders media but by the end of the 20th century a combination of factors , including falling oil prices and damage caused by the weather phenomenon el nino , had driven the economy into recession .
at-a-glance politics : three presidents have been ousted since 1997 ; current leader rafael correa has pledged to introduce sweeping reforms economy : ecuador exports oil but many people live in poverty ; indigenous groups oppose free trade policies international : free trade talks with us are frozen over a dispute about a us oil firm ; ecuador has complained of border incursions by the colombian military timeline inflation , which had become the highest in the region , led the government to replace the national currency with the us dollar in an effort to curtail it .
not all ecuadorans have benefited equally from oil revenues .
the traditionally dominant spanish-descended elite gained far more than indigenous peoples and those of mixed descent .
steps to stabilise the economy , such as austerity measures and privatisation , have generated widespread unrest , particularly among the indigenous poor .
for a small country , ecuador has many faces .
they include andean peaks , tropical rainforests and - 1,000 km -lrb- 600 miles -rrb- off the coast - the volcanic galapagos islands , home to the animals and birds whose evolutionary adaptations shaped charles darwin 's theories .
facts overview facts leaders media full name : republic of ecuador population : 13.5 million -lrb- un , 2008 -rrb- capital : quito area : 272,045 sq km -lrb- 105,037 sq miles -rrb- major languages : spanish , indigenous languages major religion : christianity life expectancy : 72 years -lrb- men -rrb- , 78 years -lrb- women -rrb- -lrb- un -rrb- monetary unit : 1 us dollar = 100 cents main exports : petroleum , bananas , shrimp , coffee , cocoa , cut flowers , fish gni per capita : us $ 3,080 -lrb- world bank , 2007 -rrb- internet domain : .ec international dialling code : + 593 leaders overview facts leaders media president : rafael correa rafael correa won the run-off vote in presidential elections in november 2006 , promising a social revolution to benefit the poor .
president correa aims to rewrite the constitution profile : rafael correa he took up his post in january 2007 , joining latin america 's club of left-leaning leaders , including venezuelan president hugo chavez and bolivian president evo morales , who have not been shy in their criticism of the us and who have led a south american nationalisation drive .
mr correa , an outsider with no political party backing , secured the support of voters in a referendum for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution - a move he says is vital to limiting the power of the traditional parties that he blames for the country 's problems .
he has attacked congress as a " sewer " of corruption and said congressmen " do not represent anyone other than their own interests and the bosses of their political parties and that is not democracy . "
he rejects a free trade pact with the us , saying it would hurt ecuador 's farmers .
and he has said he will not extend the us military 's use of the manta air base on the pacific coast for drug surveillance flights when a treaty expires in 2009 .
he opposes colombia 's coca crop spraying along their common border as part of a drug eradication programme , saying the spray drifts into ecuador and kills crops - and reportedly also farmers .
rafael correa obtained his doctorate in economics from the university of illinois in the us in 2001 and was professor at quito 's san francisco university .
he was appointed economy minister in april 2005 but was forced to resign after four months when he failed to consult the president before publicly lambasting the world bank for denying ecuador a loan .
born in 1963 , he spent a year as a volunteer in a poor indian village in the andes mountains and speaks french , english and some quechua .
he has three children with his belgian wife .
president correa pledged to re-write the constitution to increase the power of poor people and to tackle political instability , but critics said this was solely aimed at increasing his powers .
the proposals were blocked by the opposition-led congress , which criticised plans to transfer its powers to a new constitutional assembly .
president correa put the question to a referendum , which he won with 64 % support in september 2008 .

its capital , quito , once a part of the inca empire , has some of the best-preserved early colonial architecture on the continent .
traditionally a farming country , ecuador 's economy was transformed after the 1960s by the growth of industry and the discovery of oil .
there was rapid growth and progress in health , education and housing .
overview overview facts leaders media but by the end of the 20th century a combination of factors , including falling oil prices and damage caused by the weather phenomenon el nino , had driven the economy into recession .
at-a-glance politics : three presidents have been ousted since 1997 ; current leader rafael correa has pledged to introduce sweeping reforms economy : ecuador exports oil but many people live in poverty ; indigenous groups oppose free trade policies international : free trade talks with us are frozen over a dispute about a us oil firm ; ecuador has complained of border incursions by the colombian military timeline inflation , which had become the highest in the region , led the government to replace the national currency with the us dollar in an effort to curtail it .
not all ecuadorans have benefited equally from oil revenues .
the traditionally dominant spanish-descended elite gained far more than indigenous peoples and those of mixed descent .
steps to stabilise the economy , such as austerity measures and privatisation , have generated widespread unrest , particularly among the indigenous poor .
for a small country , ecuador has many faces .
they include andean peaks , tropical rainforests and - 1,000 km -lrb- 600 miles -rrb- off the coast - the volcanic galapagos islands , home to the animals and birds whose evolutionary adaptations shaped charles darwin 's theories .
