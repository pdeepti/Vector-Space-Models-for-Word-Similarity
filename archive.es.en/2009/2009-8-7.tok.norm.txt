but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are concerned about military influence in the bundestag the spd politician ulrike merten , who could become germany 's next defense minister should the social democrats win the coming general election , is a declared member of the board of the dwt .
anti-lobby groups warn against leniency critics of lobby groups said that the alleged forgetfulness or misunderstandings of those who failed to reveal their connections to military associations should not be used to cover up the seriousness of the oversight .
" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 07.08.2009 german soccer booms despite recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis wo n't keep fans from bundesliga matches , but it may make sponsors wary after record attendance last season , bundesliga experts are predicting the german league will attract even more fans this year .
but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

residents of the two neighboring villages of fiesch and fieschertal took a solemn vow way back in 1678 to lead good and blameless lives in exchange for god 's protection against being swallowed by europe 's largest glacier as it grew towards their valley .
to reinforce their prayers , they started holding an annual procession in 1862 , when the glacier reached its longest point during the mini ice age europe suffered in the mid-19th century .
perhaps occasionally some members of the community slipped up because the villages have suffered " countless , horrible natural catastrophes " during the last three hundred years , according to the local pastor , reverend pascal venetz .
but they took their vow very seriously .
female inhabitants were even once forbidden to wear colored underwear lest it might provoke the glacier .
glacier is melting rapidly due to global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope is taking the request seriously now , however , the villages have the reverse problem .
instead of dreading that the great aletsch glacier will swallow them , the ice mountain is now melting at such a rate that it is feared that flooding will one day destroy all the homes in the valley .
the glacier base is shrinking up the mountain by some 30 meters annually , according to the conservation body pro natura .
it is estimated that the river of ice has retreated some 3.4 kilometers since peaking in 1860 at a length of 23 kilometers . nearly half the shrinkage has taken place since 1950 .
vows are made to be changed the mayor of fiesch , herbert volken , came up with the idea of trying to alter the vow after witnessing changes in the glacier and its surrounding environment .
reverend venetz said he would ask the local bishop to seek pope benedict xvi 's permission to change the vow , so that god could now be asked to reverse the effects of global warming which is being blamed for the thaw .
it appears the request is being taken seriously .

residents of the two neighboring villages of fiesch and fieschertal took a solemn vow way back in 1678 to lead good and blameless lives in exchange for god 's protection against being swallowed by europe 's largest glacier as it grew towards their valley .
to reinforce their prayers , they started holding an annual procession in 1862 , when the glacier reached its longest point during the mini ice age europe suffered in the mid-19th century .
perhaps occasionally some members of the community slipped up because the villages have suffered " countless , horrible natural catastrophes " during the last three hundred years , according to the local pastor , reverend pascal venetz .
but they took their vow very seriously .
female inhabitants were even once forbidden to wear colored underwear lest it might provoke the glacier .
glacier is melting rapidly due to global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope is taking the request seriously now , however , the villages have the reverse problem .
instead of dreading that the great aletsch glacier will swallow them , the ice mountain is now melting at such a rate that it is feared that flooding will one day destroy all the homes in the valley .
the glacier base is shrinking up the mountain by some 30 meters annually , according to the conservation body pro natura .
it is estimated that the river of ice has retreated some 3.4 kilometers since peaking in 1860 at a length of 23 kilometers . nearly half the shrinkage has taken place since 1950 .
vows are made to be changed the mayor of fiesch , herbert volken , came up with the idea of trying to alter the vow after witnessing changes in the glacier and its surrounding environment .
reverend venetz said he would ask the local bishop to seek pope benedict xvi 's permission to change the vow , so that god could now be asked to reverse the effects of global warming which is being blamed for the thaw .
it appears the request is being taken seriously .

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .

" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .

the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .

stuttgart coach markus babbel gave new signings alexander hleb and pavel pogrebnyak an immediate chance to see what they could do .
first half chances the two sides showed plenty of energy in the first half and stuttgart had some opportunities with sami khedira seeing a shot saved on the line by wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio and pogrebnyak also having a header saved , but at the half-time whistle , neither side had hit the back of the net .
wolfsburg , however , was the better team throughout and the deadlock was broken in the 71st minute by zvjezdan misimovic with a curled left-footed shot from the edge of the box .
just 11 minutes later , the freshly-crowned german footballer of the year , grafite , managed to get the clincher by shrugging off a defender and slotting a shot past keeper jens lehmann .
champions wolfsburg wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title ahead of bayern munich and stuttgart .

" the request by the plaintiff can not be satisfied , " ruled judge nikolai tkachuk .
he has ordered a jury for the retrial to be selected at hearings starting september 7 .
politkovskaya 's family lawyers and prosecutors were surprised by the court 's decision to override requests from politkovskaya 's children .
they had hoped to put the trial on hold in order to give prosecutors more time to work on the case .
" we want further investigation and , then , one court for everyone involved , from the killer to the person who really ordered the murder , " said ilya politkovskaya .
karinna moskalenko , a lawyer for the politkovskaya family , said they would probably appeal the decision .
muckraking journalist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a journalist who would not take no for an answer anna politkovskaya , who was sharply critical of russia 's then-president , vladimir putin , and the kremlin , was shot in the stairwell of her moscow apartment building in 2006 .
her scathing exposes of official corruption and human rights abuses made her a target for many factions in russian politics .
a deputy editor at novaya gazeta , the newspaper politkovskaya wrote for , said that russian authorities had only scratched the surface as far as their investigation was concerned .
he claimed there is evidence of a cover-up to conceal alleged links between the chechen government and the kremlin , and added that no one is really safe .
politkovskaya 's lawyer stanislav markelov was killed in january of this year , and more recently , the human rights activist natalia estemirova , who was believed to have been a primary source for politkovskaya 's reports , was murdered execution-style .
her body was later found in ingushetia , which borders chechnya .

kadyrov , who became president of chechnya in 2007 , is a popular man with the kremlin .
he is credited with eliminating the chechen separatist movement and bringing relative calm to the region , which has been at war for the better part of 15 years .
human rights groups around the world have called on western nations to exert more pressure on the kremlin .
they want to ensure that a thorough investigation is carried out into the alleged connection between the murders of journalists and human rights workers , and the chechen president. av / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .

“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 07.08.2009 no one wants to foot the swine flu vaccination bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flu season in europe starts in september pharmaceutical companies will profit greatly when germany ’ s biggest immunization program in half a century gets underway in a few weeks .
health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't come in if you think you 've got swine flu ! "
are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .
meanwhile , it has been determined that a so-called pcr test , which could confirm if someone has swine flu , is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases .
the test failed to detect the presence of swine flu in half of all cases .
chaos feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will be immunized first ?
berlin plans to immunize millions of citizens in a very short time to beat the start of the flu season . the dstgb fears being overwhelmed with the task .
it says the government 's draft vaccination plan has not been carefully thought through and warns of confusion due to a poor allocation of responsibilities .
it has called for local health authorities , doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the government 's specific plans .
a spokeswoman for the german health ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with germany 's 16 federal states over the next few weeks .
germany 's largest health insurer , aok , has already suggested setting up four “ vaccination sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of schleswig-holstein within a very short space of time .
vaccine still untested meanwhile , pharmaceutical companies , including sanofi pasteur , novartis and csl are producing the vaccine at top speed .
but , although vaccinations are set to begin in the fall , final clinical tests could take more than a year .
prodution of the swine flu vaccine will not be able to meet worldwide demand .
to make the most efficient use of the doses available , the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- said in a press conference in geneva on thursday , that countries in the northern hemisphere should be the first to get the vaccine in september or october , when the flu season starts there .
the who added that doctors and nurses in the southern hemisphere should also be among the first people to receive swine flu shots. wl / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany tests swine flu vaccine on volunteers before germany is able to implement its plan to vaccinate 25 million people against the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- swine flu virus , the vaccine 's effectiveness needs testing .
about 1,200 people are needed to take part in the trials .
-lrb- 04.08.2009 -rrb- no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise .
-lrb- 28.07.2009 -rrb- german mass swine flu vaccinations start in september 22.5 million people can be vaccinated in the first stage of a massive anti-swine flu scheme that starts in september .
health and public workers , as well as chronically ill people will get the flu shots first .

in its financial rescue package , the german government put a 500,000-euro limit on salaries for board of director members and said bonuses would not be paid at institutes that receive federal bailout funds .
westlb had received 100 million euros in state aid from the north rhine-westphalia treasury , which also supports the bank with an additional security of two billion euros , public broadcaster ard 's " panorama " program said .
in baden-wuerttemberg , the state parliament gave a five-billion-euro boost to the lbbw on the condition that it limited managers ' salaries to 500,000 euros as long as the bank maintained a negative balance sheet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 07.08.2009 german soccer booms despite recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis wo n't keep fans from bundesliga matches , but it may make sponsors wary after record attendance last season , bundesliga experts are predicting the german league will attract even more fans this year .
but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 07.08.2009 german soccer booms despite recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis wo n't keep fans from bundesliga matches , but it may make sponsors wary after record attendance last season , bundesliga experts are predicting the german league will attract even more fans this year .
but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .

at that time , he commanded just 20 to 25 fighters but he was overshadowed by another leader from his clan - abdullah mehsud , who was believed to be his brother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah mehsud , left , a former guantanamo bay prisoner , is believed to have been baitullah 's brother " abdullah mehsud was a returnee from the guantanamo bay and had also fought in afghanistan .
therefore , he had a certain aura about him , " explained retired brigadier mehmood shah , the former security chief of pakistan 's troubled northwest .
" baitullah was young and much more dedicated towards the taliban ideology .
he was much more sincere in his work , " he added .
baitullah mehsud 's rise to the top shah added that baitullah mehsud wanted to meet him in laddah in south waziristan in 2004 but he refused because he did not consider him to be important enough . " i told him to see the assistant political agent , " he said .
when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .
he apparently opposed abdullah 's decision to kidnap two chinese engineers in 2004 .
" due to his recklessness , abdullah mehsud became anti-government and sidelined , " explained shah .
" whereas baitullah started recruiting more and more people as his fighters .
finally , he was the one who concluded an agreement with the government in 2005 .
abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "
shrewd negotiator baitullah mehsud became an undisputed leader in the area and in the end he followed the same course as abdullah .
however , he was shrewder in his dealings with the government : he forged agreements with the authorities when he was weak and dictated terms to them when he was strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehsud is believed to have been behind the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto he had been blamed for a wave of attacks in pakistan in recent years , including the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto in december 2007 and the bombing of the marriott hotel in islamabad in 2008 .
he always denied any involvement in bhutto 's death .
number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .
it is only six months ago that the americans became more convinced that he appeared to be heading the al-qaeda efforts against the pakistan government . "
experts believe that baitullah mehsud 's successor will need a considerable amount of time to establish his authority over the thousands of taliban members in northwest pakistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 07.08.2009 no one wants to foot the swine flu vaccination bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flu season in europe starts in september pharmaceutical companies will profit greatly when germany ’ s biggest immunization program in half a century gets underway in a few weeks .
health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't come in if you think you 've got swine flu ! "
are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .
meanwhile , it has been determined that a so-called pcr test , which could confirm if someone has swine flu , is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases .
the test failed to detect the presence of swine flu in half of all cases .
chaos feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will be immunized first ?
berlin plans to immunize millions of citizens in a very short time to beat the start of the flu season . the dstgb fears being overwhelmed with the task .
it says the government 's draft vaccination plan has not been carefully thought through and warns of confusion due to a poor allocation of responsibilities .
it has called for local health authorities , doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the government 's specific plans .
a spokeswoman for the german health ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with germany 's 16 federal states over the next few weeks .
germany 's largest health insurer , aok , has already suggested setting up four “ vaccination sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of schleswig-holstein within a very short space of time .
vaccine still untested meanwhile , pharmaceutical companies , including sanofi pasteur , novartis and csl are producing the vaccine at top speed .
but , although vaccinations are set to begin in the fall , final clinical tests could take more than a year .
prodution of the swine flu vaccine will not be able to meet worldwide demand .
to make the most efficient use of the doses available , the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- said in a press conference in geneva on thursday , that countries in the northern hemisphere should be the first to get the vaccine in september or october , when the flu season starts there .
the who added that doctors and nurses in the southern hemisphere should also be among the first people to receive swine flu shots. wl / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

membership in a foreign terror organization carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
the group features on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states .
as part of a plea agreement in which they confessed to involvement with the group , hasan s. -lrb- 46 -rrb- was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison .
mustafa a. -lrb- 52 -rrb- and ilhan d. -lrb- 40 -rrb- who were also convicted of forging documents , were given five years and three-and-a-half years respectively .
hasan s. and mustafa a. are turkish nationals .
ilhan d. is a german national of turkish origin .
after the sentencing , mustafa a. and ilhan d. walked free from the courtroom as they had already served their time in detention before and during the trial which lasted 15 months .
the dhkp-c is believed to have orchestrated attacks on turkish institutions in germany as well as on purported " enemies " of the group until it was banned in august 1998 . the following year , the group 's general secretary , dursan karatas , said that it would no longer use violence to achieve its political aims .
the dhkp-c is also accused of masterminding a wave of hunger strikes among left-wing prison inmates and their friends and families in turkey that has resulted in nearly 70 deaths in four years .
convictions follow extradition of regional leader the convictions in stuttgart come after hasan huseyin k. , the suspected leader of a regional chapter of the dhkp-c in germany , was extradited to germany from the netherlands in june .
he was accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and also faced charges of extortion and of beating and shooting two political dissidents in a hamburg restaurant .
the dhkp-c is believed to have some 650 members and supporters in germany. nda / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are concerned about military influence in the bundestag the spd politician ulrike merten , who could become germany 's next defense minister should the social democrats win the coming general election , is a declared member of the board of the dwt .
anti-lobby groups warn against leniency critics of lobby groups said that the alleged forgetfulness or misunderstandings of those who failed to reveal their connections to military associations should not be used to cover up the seriousness of the oversight .
" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

professional photographer thomas struth teamed up with homeless vendors in dusseldorf to reveal another side of the city . click on the link below to see photographs from the exhibition . thomas struth and rudolf druschke are an unlikely combination .
one is an internationally acclaimed artist and germany 's most famous photographer .
the other earns his living by selling fifty-fifty , a dusseldorf-based street magazine created to provide an income for its homeless vendors . druschke first met struth five years ago , at the start of the project now known as " homeless people photograph passers-by . "
the idea was to give fifty-fifty sellers a camera and to ask them to photograph their world - the streets they stand on day after day and the people who pass them by . struth himself gave on-the-job master classes to the participants , whose work is now on show in dusseldorf 's stadtmuseum . " he was a complete perfectionist , " said druschke of struth .
" i 'd take photo after photo , but he 'd still ask me to try again . " success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street vendor rudolf druschke always has a smile for his customers druschke 's pitch is in downtown dusseldorf , near the woolsworths convenient store .
in his mid-fifties with a gentle face , intelligent eyes and a warm smile , he 's something of a local treasure .
he has built up a base of loyal customers who come to him as much for his advice as for his newspaper . " thomas struth seemed outraged that i could have ended up on the streets , " said druschke .
" he kept asking how it was possible .
i think he learned a lot from the project - a lot about people . " druschke 's story is typical of many of the project 's participants : a family tragedy led to alcoholism , an addiction which cost him first his job , then his home and his relationship with his wife and children . encouraged by the friendship and support of his customers , however , druschke has now turned his life around .
he has a new partner and is working on a book which , he said , is both an autobiography and a collection of stories about the people he meets on the street .
one day , he hopes his children will read it and understand . a different view others have not been so lucky .
several of the homeless people who contributed to the exhibition have since died as a result of drug and alcohol abuse .
for many more , life on the streets remains a daily struggle . " homeless people photograph passers-by " offers a portrait of the city - seen through the eyes of those who are normally invisible . often the photographs show shoppers walking briskly past , oblivious to the presence of the homeless person with the camera .
others are affectionate portraits of favorite customers - a woman proudly stroking her pregnant belly , another so close up to the camera that her " in-your-face " personality jumps out of the frame . " life on the streets is hard , " said druschke , " but a friendly face can make all the difference .

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are concerned about military influence in the bundestag the spd politician ulrike merten , who could become germany 's next defense minister should the social democrats win the coming general election , is a declared member of the board of the dwt .
anti-lobby groups warn against leniency critics of lobby groups said that the alleged forgetfulness or misunderstandings of those who failed to reveal their connections to military associations should not be used to cover up the seriousness of the oversight .
" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

membership in a foreign terror organization carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
the group features on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states .
as part of a plea agreement in which they confessed to involvement with the group , hasan s. -lrb- 46 -rrb- was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison .
mustafa a. -lrb- 52 -rrb- and ilhan d. -lrb- 40 -rrb- who were also convicted of forging documents , were given five years and three-and-a-half years respectively .
hasan s. and mustafa a. are turkish nationals .
ilhan d. is a german national of turkish origin .
after the sentencing , mustafa a. and ilhan d. walked free from the courtroom as they had already served their time in detention before and during the trial which lasted 15 months .
the dhkp-c is believed to have orchestrated attacks on turkish institutions in germany as well as on purported " enemies " of the group until it was banned in august 1998 . the following year , the group 's general secretary , dursan karatas , said that it would no longer use violence to achieve its political aims .
the dhkp-c is also accused of masterminding a wave of hunger strikes among left-wing prison inmates and their friends and families in turkey that has resulted in nearly 70 deaths in four years .
convictions follow extradition of regional leader the convictions in stuttgart come after hasan huseyin k. , the suspected leader of a regional chapter of the dhkp-c in germany , was extradited to germany from the netherlands in june .
he was accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and also faced charges of extortion and of beating and shooting two political dissidents in a hamburg restaurant .
the dhkp-c is believed to have some 650 members and supporters in germany. nda / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't come in if you think you 've got swine flu ! "
are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .
meanwhile , it has been determined that a so-called pcr test , which could confirm if someone has swine flu , is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases .
the test failed to detect the presence of swine flu in half of all cases .
chaos feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will be immunized first ?
berlin plans to immunize millions of citizens in a very short time to beat the start of the flu season . the dstgb fears being overwhelmed with the task .
it says the government 's draft vaccination plan has not been carefully thought through and warns of confusion due to a poor allocation of responsibilities .
it has called for local health authorities , doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the government 's specific plans .
a spokeswoman for the german health ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with germany 's 16 federal states over the next few weeks .
germany 's largest health insurer , aok , has already suggested setting up four “ vaccination sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of schleswig-holstein within a very short space of time .
vaccine still untested meanwhile , pharmaceutical companies , including sanofi pasteur , novartis and csl are producing the vaccine at top speed .
but , although vaccinations are set to begin in the fall , final clinical tests could take more than a year .
prodution of the swine flu vaccine will not be able to meet worldwide demand .
to make the most efficient use of the doses available , the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- said in a press conference in geneva on thursday , that countries in the northern hemisphere should be the first to get the vaccine in september or october , when the flu season starts there .
the who added that doctors and nurses in the southern hemisphere should also be among the first people to receive swine flu shots. wl / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are concerned about military influence in the bundestag the spd politician ulrike merten , who could become germany 's next defense minister should the social democrats win the coming general election , is a declared member of the board of the dwt .
anti-lobby groups warn against leniency critics of lobby groups said that the alleged forgetfulness or misunderstandings of those who failed to reveal their connections to military associations should not be used to cover up the seriousness of the oversight .
" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title . the german bundesliga football season kicked off on friday night with a stylish win for vfl wolfsburg against visitors stuttgart .
the champions won 2-0 .
new wolfsburg coach armin veh made just one change from the side preferred by his predecessor felix magath last season with karim ziani starting in the midfield behind edin dzeko and grafite .
stuttgart coach markus babbel gave new signings alexander hleb and pavel pogrebnyak an immediate chance to see what they could do .
first half chances the two sides showed plenty of energy in the first half and stuttgart had some opportunities with sami khedira seeing a shot saved on the line by wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio and pogrebnyak also having a header saved , but at the half-time whistle , neither side had hit the back of the net .
wolfsburg , however , was the better team throughout and the deadlock was broken in the 71st minute by zvjezdan misimovic with a curled left-footed shot from the edge of the box .
just 11 minutes later , the freshly-crowned german footballer of the year , grafite , managed to get the clincher by shrugging off a defender and slotting a shot past keeper jens lehmann .
champions wolfsburg wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title ahead of bayern munich and stuttgart .
the brazilian , grafite , was last season 's bundesliga top scorer knotching up 28 goals to his credit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 07.08.2009 parliamentarians fail to reveal arms lobby ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag rules say politicians must reveal memberships several german parliamentarians have come under pressure after reports said they concealed their memberships in military associations close to the country 's arms lobby . five members of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , have held senior positions at the german society for military technology -lrb- dwt -rrb- and the association of the german army -lrb- fkh -rrb- without making public their membership in the bodies , according to german news agency dpa .
parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are concerned about military influence in the bundestag the spd politician ulrike merten , who could become germany 's next defense minister should the social democrats win the coming general election , is a declared member of the board of the dwt .
anti-lobby groups warn against leniency critics of lobby groups said that the alleged forgetfulness or misunderstandings of those who failed to reveal their connections to military associations should not be used to cover up the seriousness of the oversight .
" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

membership in a foreign terror organization carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
the group features on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states .

the dhkp-c is also accused of masterminding a wave of hunger strikes among left-wing prison inmates and their friends and families in turkey that has resulted in nearly 70 deaths in four years .

he was accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and also faced charges of extortion and of beating and shooting two political dissidents in a hamburg restaurant .

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 07.08.2009 no one wants to foot the swine flu vaccination bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flu season in europe starts in september pharmaceutical companies will profit greatly when germany ’ s biggest immunization program in half a century gets underway in a few weeks .
health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't come in if you think you 've got swine flu ! "
are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't come in if you think you 've got swine flu ! "
are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .
meanwhile , it has been determined that a so-called pcr test , which could confirm if someone has swine flu , is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases .
the test failed to detect the presence of swine flu in half of all cases .

membership in a foreign terror organization carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
the group features on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states .
as part of a plea agreement in which they confessed to involvement with the group , hasan s. -lrb- 46 -rrb- was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison .
mustafa a. -lrb- 52 -rrb- and ilhan d. -lrb- 40 -rrb- who were also convicted of forging documents , were given five years and three-and-a-half years respectively .
hasan s. and mustafa a. are turkish nationals .
ilhan d. is a german national of turkish origin .
after the sentencing , mustafa a. and ilhan d. walked free from the courtroom as they had already served their time in detention before and during the trial which lasted 15 months .
the dhkp-c is believed to have orchestrated attacks on turkish institutions in germany as well as on purported " enemies " of the group until it was banned in august 1998 . the following year , the group 's general secretary , dursan karatas , said that it would no longer use violence to achieve its political aims .
the dhkp-c is also accused of masterminding a wave of hunger strikes among left-wing prison inmates and their friends and families in turkey that has resulted in nearly 70 deaths in four years .
convictions follow extradition of regional leader the convictions in stuttgart come after hasan huseyin k. , the suspected leader of a regional chapter of the dhkp-c in germany , was extradited to germany from the netherlands in june .
he was accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and also faced charges of extortion and of beating and shooting two political dissidents in a hamburg restaurant .
the dhkp-c is believed to have some 650 members and supporters in germany. nda / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are concerned about military influence in the bundestag the spd politician ulrike merten , who could become germany 's next defense minister should the social democrats win the coming general election , is a declared member of the board of the dwt .
anti-lobby groups warn against leniency critics of lobby groups said that the alleged forgetfulness or misunderstandings of those who failed to reveal their connections to military associations should not be used to cover up the seriousness of the oversight .
" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .

“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?

are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .
meanwhile , it has been determined that a so-called pcr test , which could confirm if someone has swine flu , is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases .
the test failed to detect the presence of swine flu in half of all cases .

berlin plans to immunize millions of citizens in a very short time to beat the start of the flu season . the dstgb fears being overwhelmed with the task .
it says the government 's draft vaccination plan has not been carefully thought through and warns of confusion due to a poor allocation of responsibilities .
it has called for local health authorities , doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the government 's specific plans .
a spokeswoman for the german health ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with germany 's 16 federal states over the next few weeks .
germany 's largest health insurer , aok , has already suggested setting up four “ vaccination sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of schleswig-holstein within a very short space of time .
vaccine still untested meanwhile , pharmaceutical companies , including sanofi pasteur , novartis and csl are producing the vaccine at top speed .

but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are concerned about military influence in the bundestag the spd politician ulrike merten , who could become germany 's next defense minister should the social democrats win the coming general election , is a declared member of the board of the dwt .
anti-lobby groups warn against leniency critics of lobby groups said that the alleged forgetfulness or misunderstandings of those who failed to reveal their connections to military associations should not be used to cover up the seriousness of the oversight .
" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

membership in a foreign terror organization carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
the group features on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states .
as part of a plea agreement in which they confessed to involvement with the group , hasan s. -lrb- 46 -rrb- was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison .
mustafa a. -lrb- 52 -rrb- and ilhan d. -lrb- 40 -rrb- who were also convicted of forging documents , were given five years and three-and-a-half years respectively .
hasan s. and mustafa a. are turkish nationals .
ilhan d. is a german national of turkish origin .
after the sentencing , mustafa a. and ilhan d. walked free from the courtroom as they had already served their time in detention before and during the trial which lasted 15 months .
the dhkp-c is believed to have orchestrated attacks on turkish institutions in germany as well as on purported " enemies " of the group until it was banned in august 1998 . the following year , the group 's general secretary , dursan karatas , said that it would no longer use violence to achieve its political aims .
the dhkp-c is also accused of masterminding a wave of hunger strikes among left-wing prison inmates and their friends and families in turkey that has resulted in nearly 70 deaths in four years .
convictions follow extradition of regional leader the convictions in stuttgart come after hasan huseyin k. , the suspected leader of a regional chapter of the dhkp-c in germany , was extradited to germany from the netherlands in june .
he was accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and also faced charges of extortion and of beating and shooting two political dissidents in a hamburg restaurant .
the dhkp-c is believed to have some 650 members and supporters in germany. nda / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

membership in a foreign terror organization carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
the group features on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states .
as part of a plea agreement in which they confessed to involvement with the group , hasan s. -lrb- 46 -rrb- was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison .
mustafa a. -lrb- 52 -rrb- and ilhan d. -lrb- 40 -rrb- who were also convicted of forging documents , were given five years and three-and-a-half years respectively .
hasan s. and mustafa a. are turkish nationals .
ilhan d. is a german national of turkish origin .
after the sentencing , mustafa a. and ilhan d. walked free from the courtroom as they had already served their time in detention before and during the trial which lasted 15 months .
the dhkp-c is believed to have orchestrated attacks on turkish institutions in germany as well as on purported " enemies " of the group until it was banned in august 1998 . the following year , the group 's general secretary , dursan karatas , said that it would no longer use violence to achieve its political aims .
the dhkp-c is also accused of masterminding a wave of hunger strikes among left-wing prison inmates and their friends and families in turkey that has resulted in nearly 70 deaths in four years .
convictions follow extradition of regional leader the convictions in stuttgart come after hasan huseyin k. , the suspected leader of a regional chapter of the dhkp-c in germany , was extradited to germany from the netherlands in june .
he was accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and also faced charges of extortion and of beating and shooting two political dissidents in a hamburg restaurant .
the dhkp-c is believed to have some 650 members and supporters in germany. nda / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .

professional photographer thomas struth teamed up with homeless vendors in dusseldorf to reveal another side of the city . click on the link below to see photographs from the exhibition . thomas struth and rudolf druschke are an unlikely combination .
one is an internationally acclaimed artist and germany 's most famous photographer .
the other earns his living by selling fifty-fifty , a dusseldorf-based street magazine created to provide an income for its homeless vendors . druschke first met struth five years ago , at the start of the project now known as " homeless people photograph passers-by . "
the idea was to give fifty-fifty sellers a camera and to ask them to photograph their world - the streets they stand on day after day and the people who pass them by . struth himself gave on-the-job master classes to the participants , whose work is now on show in dusseldorf 's stadtmuseum . " he was a complete perfectionist , " said druschke of struth .
" i 'd take photo after photo , but he 'd still ask me to try again . " success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street vendor rudolf druschke always has a smile for his customers druschke 's pitch is in downtown dusseldorf , near the woolsworths convenient store .
in his mid-fifties with a gentle face , intelligent eyes and a warm smile , he 's something of a local treasure .
he has built up a base of loyal customers who come to him as much for his advice as for his newspaper . " thomas struth seemed outraged that i could have ended up on the streets , " said druschke .
" he kept asking how it was possible .
i think he learned a lot from the project - a lot about people . " druschke 's story is typical of many of the project 's participants : a family tragedy led to alcoholism , an addiction which cost him first his job , then his home and his relationship with his wife and children . encouraged by the friendship and support of his customers , however , druschke has now turned his life around .
he has a new partner and is working on a book which , he said , is both an autobiography and a collection of stories about the people he meets on the street .
one day , he hopes his children will read it and understand . a different view others have not been so lucky .
several of the homeless people who contributed to the exhibition have since died as a result of drug and alcohol abuse .
for many more , life on the streets remains a daily struggle . " homeless people photograph passers-by " offers a portrait of the city - seen through the eyes of those who are normally invisible . often the photographs show shoppers walking briskly past , oblivious to the presence of the homeless person with the camera .
others are affectionate portraits of favorite customers - a woman proudly stroking her pregnant belly , another so close up to the camera that her " in-your-face " personality jumps out of the frame . " life on the streets is hard , " said druschke , " but a friendly face can make all the difference .

membership in a foreign terror organization carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
the group features on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states .
as part of a plea agreement in which they confessed to involvement with the group , hasan s. -lrb- 46 -rrb- was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison .
mustafa a. -lrb- 52 -rrb- and ilhan d. -lrb- 40 -rrb- who were also convicted of forging documents , were given five years and three-and-a-half years respectively .
hasan s. and mustafa a. are turkish nationals .
ilhan d. is a german national of turkish origin .
after the sentencing , mustafa a. and ilhan d. walked free from the courtroom as they had already served their time in detention before and during the trial which lasted 15 months .
the dhkp-c is believed to have orchestrated attacks on turkish institutions in germany as well as on purported " enemies " of the group until it was banned in august 1998 . the following year , the group 's general secretary , dursan karatas , said that it would no longer use violence to achieve its political aims .
the dhkp-c is also accused of masterminding a wave of hunger strikes among left-wing prison inmates and their friends and families in turkey that has resulted in nearly 70 deaths in four years .
convictions follow extradition of regional leader the convictions in stuttgart come after hasan huseyin k. , the suspected leader of a regional chapter of the dhkp-c in germany , was extradited to germany from the netherlands in june .
he was accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and also faced charges of extortion and of beating and shooting two political dissidents in a hamburg restaurant .
the dhkp-c is believed to have some 650 members and supporters in germany. nda / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 07.08.2009 german soccer booms despite recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis wo n't keep fans from bundesliga matches , but it may make sponsors wary after record attendance last season , bundesliga experts are predicting the german league will attract even more fans this year .
but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

in its financial rescue package , the german government put a 500,000-euro limit on salaries for board of director members and said bonuses would not be paid at institutes that receive federal bailout funds .
westlb had received 100 million euros in state aid from the north rhine-westphalia treasury , which also supports the bank with an additional security of two billion euros , public broadcaster ard 's " panorama " program said .
in baden-wuerttemberg , the state parliament gave a five-billion-euro boost to the lbbw on the condition that it limited managers ' salaries to 500,000 euros as long as the bank maintained a negative balance sheet .
media reports that leading executives at dresdner bank were paid millions of euros in bonuses sparked a debate earlier in the year in germany about managers ' payments .

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are concerned about military influence in the bundestag the spd politician ulrike merten , who could become germany 's next defense minister should the social democrats win the coming general election , is a declared member of the board of the dwt .
anti-lobby groups warn against leniency critics of lobby groups said that the alleged forgetfulness or misunderstandings of those who failed to reveal their connections to military associations should not be used to cover up the seriousness of the oversight .
" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "

arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .

" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .

the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .

membership in a foreign terror organization carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
the group features on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states .
as part of a plea agreement in which they confessed to involvement with the group , hasan s. -lrb- 46 -rrb- was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison .
mustafa a. -lrb- 52 -rrb- and ilhan d. -lrb- 40 -rrb- who were also convicted of forging documents , were given five years and three-and-a-half years respectively .
hasan s. and mustafa a. are turkish nationals .
ilhan d. is a german national of turkish origin .
after the sentencing , mustafa a. and ilhan d. walked free from the courtroom as they had already served their time in detention before and during the trial which lasted 15 months .
the dhkp-c is believed to have orchestrated attacks on turkish institutions in germany as well as on purported " enemies " of the group until it was banned in august 1998 . the following year , the group 's general secretary , dursan karatas , said that it would no longer use violence to achieve its political aims .
the dhkp-c is also accused of masterminding a wave of hunger strikes among left-wing prison inmates and their friends and families in turkey that has resulted in nearly 70 deaths in four years .
convictions follow extradition of regional leader the convictions in stuttgart come after hasan huseyin k. , the suspected leader of a regional chapter of the dhkp-c in germany , was extradited to germany from the netherlands in june .
he was accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and also faced charges of extortion and of beating and shooting two political dissidents in a hamburg restaurant .
the dhkp-c is believed to have some 650 members and supporters in germany. nda / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

membership in a foreign terror organization carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
the group features on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states .
as part of a plea agreement in which they confessed to involvement with the group , hasan s. -lrb- 46 -rrb- was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison .
mustafa a. -lrb- 52 -rrb- and ilhan d. -lrb- 40 -rrb- who were also convicted of forging documents , were given five years and three-and-a-half years respectively .
hasan s. and mustafa a. are turkish nationals .
ilhan d. is a german national of turkish origin .
after the sentencing , mustafa a. and ilhan d. walked free from the courtroom as they had already served their time in detention before and during the trial which lasted 15 months .
the dhkp-c is believed to have orchestrated attacks on turkish institutions in germany as well as on purported " enemies " of the group until it was banned in august 1998 . the following year , the group 's general secretary , dursan karatas , said that it would no longer use violence to achieve its political aims .
the dhkp-c is also accused of masterminding a wave of hunger strikes among left-wing prison inmates and their friends and families in turkey that has resulted in nearly 70 deaths in four years .
convictions follow extradition of regional leader the convictions in stuttgart come after hasan huseyin k. , the suspected leader of a regional chapter of the dhkp-c in germany , was extradited to germany from the netherlands in june .
he was accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and also faced charges of extortion and of beating and shooting two political dissidents in a hamburg restaurant .
the dhkp-c is believed to have some 650 members and supporters in germany. nda / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

professional photographer thomas struth teamed up with homeless vendors in dusseldorf to reveal another side of the city . click on the link below to see photographs from the exhibition . thomas struth and rudolf druschke are an unlikely combination .
one is an internationally acclaimed artist and germany 's most famous photographer .
the other earns his living by selling fifty-fifty , a dusseldorf-based street magazine created to provide an income for its homeless vendors . druschke first met struth five years ago , at the start of the project now known as " homeless people photograph passers-by . "
the idea was to give fifty-fifty sellers a camera and to ask them to photograph their world - the streets they stand on day after day and the people who pass them by . struth himself gave on-the-job master classes to the participants , whose work is now on show in dusseldorf 's stadtmuseum . " he was a complete perfectionist , " said druschke of struth .
" i 'd take photo after photo , but he 'd still ask me to try again . " success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street vendor rudolf druschke always has a smile for his customers druschke 's pitch is in downtown dusseldorf , near the woolsworths convenient store .
in his mid-fifties with a gentle face , intelligent eyes and a warm smile , he 's something of a local treasure .
he has built up a base of loyal customers who come to him as much for his advice as for his newspaper . " thomas struth seemed outraged that i could have ended up on the streets , " said druschke .
" he kept asking how it was possible .
i think he learned a lot from the project - a lot about people . " druschke 's story is typical of many of the project 's participants : a family tragedy led to alcoholism , an addiction which cost him first his job , then his home and his relationship with his wife and children . encouraged by the friendship and support of his customers , however , druschke has now turned his life around .
he has a new partner and is working on a book which , he said , is both an autobiography and a collection of stories about the people he meets on the street .
one day , he hopes his children will read it and understand . a different view others have not been so lucky .
several of the homeless people who contributed to the exhibition have since died as a result of drug and alcohol abuse .
for many more , life on the streets remains a daily struggle . " homeless people photograph passers-by " offers a portrait of the city - seen through the eyes of those who are normally invisible . often the photographs show shoppers walking briskly past , oblivious to the presence of the homeless person with the camera .
others are affectionate portraits of favorite customers - a woman proudly stroking her pregnant belly , another so close up to the camera that her " in-your-face " personality jumps out of the frame . " life on the streets is hard , " said druschke , " but a friendly face can make all the difference .

i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

in its financial rescue package , the german government put a 500,000-euro limit on salaries for board of director members and said bonuses would not be paid at institutes that receive federal bailout funds .
westlb had received 100 million euros in state aid from the north rhine-westphalia treasury , which also supports the bank with an additional security of two billion euros , public broadcaster ard 's " panorama " program said .
in baden-wuerttemberg , the state parliament gave a five-billion-euro boost to the lbbw on the condition that it limited managers ' salaries to 500,000 euros as long as the bank maintained a negative balance sheet .
media reports that leading executives at dresdner bank were paid millions of euros in bonuses sparked a debate earlier in the year in germany about managers ' payments .
dresdner was taken over by commerzbank , which has also received billions in state aid. nda / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are concerned about military influence in the bundestag the spd politician ulrike merten , who could become germany 's next defense minister should the social democrats win the coming general election , is a declared member of the board of the dwt .
anti-lobby groups warn against leniency critics of lobby groups said that the alleged forgetfulness or misunderstandings of those who failed to reveal their connections to military associations should not be used to cover up the seriousness of the oversight .
" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

professional photographer thomas struth teamed up with homeless vendors in dusseldorf to reveal another side of the city . click on the link below to see photographs from the exhibition . thomas struth and rudolf druschke are an unlikely combination .
one is an internationally acclaimed artist and germany 's most famous photographer .
the other earns his living by selling fifty-fifty , a dusseldorf-based street magazine created to provide an income for its homeless vendors . druschke first met struth five years ago , at the start of the project now known as " homeless people photograph passers-by . "
the idea was to give fifty-fifty sellers a camera and to ask them to photograph their world - the streets they stand on day after day and the people who pass them by . struth himself gave on-the-job master classes to the participants , whose work is now on show in dusseldorf 's stadtmuseum . " he was a complete perfectionist , " said druschke of struth .
" i 'd take photo after photo , but he 'd still ask me to try again . " success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street vendor rudolf druschke always has a smile for his customers druschke 's pitch is in downtown dusseldorf , near the woolsworths convenient store .
in his mid-fifties with a gentle face , intelligent eyes and a warm smile , he 's something of a local treasure .
he has built up a base of loyal customers who come to him as much for his advice as for his newspaper . " thomas struth seemed outraged that i could have ended up on the streets , " said druschke .
" he kept asking how it was possible .
i think he learned a lot from the project - a lot about people . " druschke 's story is typical of many of the project 's participants : a family tragedy led to alcoholism , an addiction which cost him first his job , then his home and his relationship with his wife and children . encouraged by the friendship and support of his customers , however , druschke has now turned his life around .
he has a new partner and is working on a book which , he said , is both an autobiography and a collection of stories about the people he meets on the street .
one day , he hopes his children will read it and understand . a different view others have not been so lucky .
several of the homeless people who contributed to the exhibition have since died as a result of drug and alcohol abuse .
for many more , life on the streets remains a daily struggle . " homeless people photograph passers-by " offers a portrait of the city - seen through the eyes of those who are normally invisible . often the photographs show shoppers walking briskly past , oblivious to the presence of the homeless person with the camera .
others are affectionate portraits of favorite customers - a woman proudly stroking her pregnant belly , another so close up to the camera that her " in-your-face " personality jumps out of the frame . " life on the streets is hard , " said druschke , " but a friendly face can make all the difference .

and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .

bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .

according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title . the german bundesliga football season kicked off on friday night with a stylish win for vfl wolfsburg against visitors stuttgart .
the champions won 2-0 .
new wolfsburg coach armin veh made just one change from the side preferred by his predecessor felix magath last season with karim ziani starting in the midfield behind edin dzeko and grafite .
stuttgart coach markus babbel gave new signings alexander hleb and pavel pogrebnyak an immediate chance to see what they could do .
first half chances the two sides showed plenty of energy in the first half and stuttgart had some opportunities with sami khedira seeing a shot saved on the line by wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio and pogrebnyak also having a header saved , but at the half-time whistle , neither side had hit the back of the net .
wolfsburg , however , was the better team throughout and the deadlock was broken in the 71st minute by zvjezdan misimovic with a curled left-footed shot from the edge of the box .
just 11 minutes later , the freshly-crowned german footballer of the year , grafite , managed to get the clincher by shrugging off a defender and slotting a shot past keeper jens lehmann .
champions wolfsburg wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title ahead of bayern munich and stuttgart .
the brazilian , grafite , was last season 's bundesliga top scorer knotching up 28 goals to his credit .
grafite summed up tonight 's opening victory thus : " it was a nice evening for the club and for myself .

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .

“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 07.08.2009 russian military court refuses to halt murder trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna politkovskaya murder trial to continue on friday , a russian military court rejected a petition from the family of anna politkovskaya , the prominent journalist and kremlin critic who was murdered in 2006 , to put a new trial on hold . by turning down the appeal from politkovskaya 's family , the retrial of three men who were acquitted of being accomplices in her murder can proceed .
" the request by the plaintiff can not be satisfied , " ruled judge nikolai tkachuk .
he has ordered a jury for the retrial to be selected at hearings starting september 7 .
politkovskaya 's family lawyers and prosecutors were surprised by the court 's decision to override requests from politkovskaya 's children .
they had hoped to put the trial on hold in order to give prosecutors more time to work on the case .
" we want further investigation and , then , one court for everyone involved , from the killer to the person who really ordered the murder , " said ilya politkovskaya .
karinna moskalenko , a lawyer for the politkovskaya family , said they would probably appeal the decision .
muckraking journalist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a journalist who would not take no for an answer anna politkovskaya , who was sharply critical of russia 's then-president , vladimir putin , and the kremlin , was shot in the stairwell of her moscow apartment building in 2006 .
her scathing exposes of official corruption and human rights abuses made her a target for many factions in russian politics .
a deputy editor at novaya gazeta , the newspaper politkovskaya wrote for , said that russian authorities had only scratched the surface as far as their investigation was concerned .
he claimed there is evidence of a cover-up to conceal alleged links between the chechen government and the kremlin , and added that no one is really safe .
politkovskaya 's lawyer stanislav markelov was killed in january of this year , and more recently , the human rights activist natalia estemirova , who was believed to have been a primary source for politkovskaya 's reports , was murdered execution-style .

wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title . the german bundesliga football season kicked off on friday night with a stylish win for vfl wolfsburg against visitors stuttgart .
the champions won 2-0 .
new wolfsburg coach armin veh made just one change from the side preferred by his predecessor felix magath last season with karim ziani starting in the midfield behind edin dzeko and grafite .
stuttgart coach markus babbel gave new signings alexander hleb and pavel pogrebnyak an immediate chance to see what they could do .
first half chances the two sides showed plenty of energy in the first half and stuttgart had some opportunities with sami khedira seeing a shot saved on the line by wolfsburg goalkeeper diego benaglio and pogrebnyak also having a header saved , but at the half-time whistle , neither side had hit the back of the net .
wolfsburg , however , was the better team throughout and the deadlock was broken in the 71st minute by zvjezdan misimovic with a curled left-footed shot from the edge of the box .
just 11 minutes later , the freshly-crowned german footballer of the year , grafite , managed to get the clincher by shrugging off a defender and slotting a shot past keeper jens lehmann .
champions wolfsburg wolfsburg went undefeated at home last season with 16 wins and a draw en route to a surprise first national title ahead of bayern munich and stuttgart .

at that time , he commanded just 20 to 25 fighters but he was overshadowed by another leader from his clan - abdullah mehsud , who was believed to be his brother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah mehsud , left , a former guantanamo bay prisoner , is believed to have been baitullah 's brother " abdullah mehsud was a returnee from the guantanamo bay and had also fought in afghanistan .
therefore , he had a certain aura about him , " explained retired brigadier mehmood shah , the former security chief of pakistan 's troubled northwest .
" baitullah was young and much more dedicated towards the taliban ideology .
he was much more sincere in his work , " he added .
baitullah mehsud 's rise to the top shah added that baitullah mehsud wanted to meet him in laddah in south waziristan in 2004 but he refused because he did not consider him to be important enough . " i told him to see the assistant political agent , " he said .
when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .
he apparently opposed abdullah 's decision to kidnap two chinese engineers in 2004 .
" due to his recklessness , abdullah mehsud became anti-government and sidelined , " explained shah .
" whereas baitullah started recruiting more and more people as his fighters .
finally , he was the one who concluded an agreement with the government in 2005 .
abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "
shrewd negotiator baitullah mehsud became an undisputed leader in the area and in the end he followed the same course as abdullah .
however , he was shrewder in his dealings with the government : he forged agreements with the authorities when he was weak and dictated terms to them when he was strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehsud is believed to have been behind the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto he had been blamed for a wave of attacks in pakistan in recent years , including the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto in december 2007 and the bombing of the marriott hotel in islamabad in 2008 .
he always denied any involvement in bhutto 's death .
number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .
it is only six months ago that the americans became more convinced that he appeared to be heading the al-qaeda efforts against the pakistan government . "
experts believe that baitullah mehsud 's successor will need a considerable amount of time to establish his authority over the thousands of taliban members in northwest pakistan .

" the request by the plaintiff can not be satisfied , " ruled judge nikolai tkachuk .
he has ordered a jury for the retrial to be selected at hearings starting september 7 .
politkovskaya 's family lawyers and prosecutors were surprised by the court 's decision to override requests from politkovskaya 's children .
they had hoped to put the trial on hold in order to give prosecutors more time to work on the case .
" we want further investigation and , then , one court for everyone involved , from the killer to the person who really ordered the murder , " said ilya politkovskaya .
karinna moskalenko , a lawyer for the politkovskaya family , said they would probably appeal the decision .
muckraking journalist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a journalist who would not take no for an answer anna politkovskaya , who was sharply critical of russia 's then-president , vladimir putin , and the kremlin , was shot in the stairwell of her moscow apartment building in 2006 .
her scathing exposes of official corruption and human rights abuses made her a target for many factions in russian politics .
a deputy editor at novaya gazeta , the newspaper politkovskaya wrote for , said that russian authorities had only scratched the surface as far as their investigation was concerned .
he claimed there is evidence of a cover-up to conceal alleged links between the chechen government and the kremlin , and added that no one is really safe .
politkovskaya 's lawyer stanislav markelov was killed in january of this year , and more recently , the human rights activist natalia estemirova , who was believed to have been a primary source for politkovskaya 's reports , was murdered execution-style .
her body was later found in ingushetia , which borders chechnya .
chechen involvement ?

kadyrov , who became president of chechnya in 2007 , is a popular man with the kremlin .
he is credited with eliminating the chechen separatist movement and bringing relative calm to the region , which has been at war for the better part of 15 years .
human rights groups around the world have called on western nations to exert more pressure on the kremlin .
they want to ensure that a thorough investigation is carried out into the alleged connection between the murders of journalists and human rights workers , and the chechen president. av / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at that time , he commanded just 20 to 25 fighters but he was overshadowed by another leader from his clan - abdullah mehsud , who was believed to be his brother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah mehsud , left , a former guantanamo bay prisoner , is believed to have been baitullah 's brother " abdullah mehsud was a returnee from the guantanamo bay and had also fought in afghanistan .
therefore , he had a certain aura about him , " explained retired brigadier mehmood shah , the former security chief of pakistan 's troubled northwest .
" baitullah was young and much more dedicated towards the taliban ideology .
he was much more sincere in his work , " he added .
baitullah mehsud 's rise to the top shah added that baitullah mehsud wanted to meet him in laddah in south waziristan in 2004 but he refused because he did not consider him to be important enough . " i told him to see the assistant political agent , " he said .
when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .
he apparently opposed abdullah 's decision to kidnap two chinese engineers in 2004 .
" due to his recklessness , abdullah mehsud became anti-government and sidelined , " explained shah .
" whereas baitullah started recruiting more and more people as his fighters .
finally , he was the one who concluded an agreement with the government in 2005 .
abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "
shrewd negotiator baitullah mehsud became an undisputed leader in the area and in the end he followed the same course as abdullah .
however , he was shrewder in his dealings with the government : he forged agreements with the authorities when he was weak and dictated terms to them when he was strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehsud is believed to have been behind the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto he had been blamed for a wave of attacks in pakistan in recent years , including the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto in december 2007 and the bombing of the marriott hotel in islamabad in 2008 .
he always denied any involvement in bhutto 's death .
number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .
it is only six months ago that the americans became more convinced that he appeared to be heading the al-qaeda efforts against the pakistan government . "
experts believe that baitullah mehsud 's successor will need a considerable amount of time to establish his authority over the thousands of taliban members in northwest pakistan .

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .

“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't come in if you think you 've got swine flu ! "
are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .
meanwhile , it has been determined that a so-called pcr test , which could confirm if someone has swine flu , is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases .
the test failed to detect the presence of swine flu in half of all cases .
chaos feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will be immunized first ?
berlin plans to immunize millions of citizens in a very short time to beat the start of the flu season . the dstgb fears being overwhelmed with the task .
it says the government 's draft vaccination plan has not been carefully thought through and warns of confusion due to a poor allocation of responsibilities .
it has called for local health authorities , doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the government 's specific plans .
a spokeswoman for the german health ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with germany 's 16 federal states over the next few weeks .
germany 's largest health insurer , aok , has already suggested setting up four “ vaccination sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of schleswig-holstein within a very short space of time .
vaccine still untested meanwhile , pharmaceutical companies , including sanofi pasteur , novartis and csl are producing the vaccine at top speed .
but , although vaccinations are set to begin in the fall , final clinical tests could take more than a year .
prodution of the swine flu vaccine will not be able to meet worldwide demand .
to make the most efficient use of the doses available , the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- said in a press conference in geneva on thursday , that countries in the northern hemisphere should be the first to get the vaccine in september or october , when the flu season starts there .
the who added that doctors and nurses in the southern hemisphere should also be among the first people to receive swine flu shots. wl / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah mehsud , left , a former guantanamo bay prisoner , is believed to have been baitullah 's brother " abdullah mehsud was a returnee from the guantanamo bay and had also fought in afghanistan .
therefore , he had a certain aura about him , " explained retired brigadier mehmood shah , the former security chief of pakistan 's troubled northwest .
" baitullah was young and much more dedicated towards the taliban ideology .
he was much more sincere in his work , " he added .
baitullah mehsud 's rise to the top shah added that baitullah mehsud wanted to meet him in laddah in south waziristan in 2004 but he refused because he did not consider him to be important enough . " i told him to see the assistant political agent , " he said .
when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .
he apparently opposed abdullah 's decision to kidnap two chinese engineers in 2004 .
" due to his recklessness , abdullah mehsud became anti-government and sidelined , " explained shah .
" whereas baitullah started recruiting more and more people as his fighters .
finally , he was the one who concluded an agreement with the government in 2005 .
abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "
shrewd negotiator baitullah mehsud became an undisputed leader in the area and in the end he followed the same course as abdullah .
however , he was shrewder in his dealings with the government : he forged agreements with the authorities when he was weak and dictated terms to them when he was strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehsud is believed to have been behind the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto he had been blamed for a wave of attacks in pakistan in recent years , including the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto in december 2007 and the bombing of the marriott hotel in islamabad in 2008 .
he always denied any involvement in bhutto 's death .
number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .
it is only six months ago that the americans became more convinced that he appeared to be heading the al-qaeda efforts against the pakistan government . "
experts believe that baitullah mehsud 's successor will need a considerable amount of time to establish his authority over the thousands of taliban members in northwest pakistan .

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

the judges decided that compulsory school attendance was valid in situations where the school maintained a neutral and tolerant stance toward the parents ' values .
the parents went to court to appeal a fine of 80 euros -lrb- $ 115 -rrb- imposed on them for failing to send their children to school .
the parents had claimed the theater performance about sexual abuse taught children that they alone could determine their sexuality , and that carnival is a roman catholic festival during which people behave immorally , bingeing on food and alcohol .
the boys ' school argued it had maintained its neutrality and tolerance by offering swimming and gymnastics as alternatives .
a long-standing issue for religious parents germany has particularly rigid school attendance laws .
home-schooling is illegal and opting out of certain subjects on religious and cultural grounds is not allowed .
one deeply religious couple , who had tried to home-school their five children , is now seeking asylum in the us , saying the german school attendance laws persecute them for their religion .
last year a duesseldorf court ruled that a 12-year-old muslim schoolgirl must take part in co-educational swimming lessons at her school , despite her parents ' objections on religious grounds to their daughter wearing close-fitting clothing .
although the most recent federal court decision applies to all of germany , which specific classes a school offers is ultimately decided at the state level .
thus , while the sexual education programs might vary from state to state , no schoolchild attending school in germany can skip any sort of class or subject – be it physical education , biology or math – for religious reasons. hf / dpa / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the judges decided that compulsory school attendance was valid in situations where the school maintained a neutral and tolerant stance toward the parents ' values .
the parents went to court to appeal a fine of 80 euros -lrb- $ 115 -rrb- imposed on them for failing to send their children to school .
the parents had claimed the theater performance about sexual abuse taught children that they alone could determine their sexuality , and that carnival is a roman catholic festival during which people behave immorally , bingeing on food and alcohol .
the boys ' school argued it had maintained its neutrality and tolerance by offering swimming and gymnastics as alternatives .
a long-standing issue for religious parents germany has particularly rigid school attendance laws .
home-schooling is illegal and opting out of certain subjects on religious and cultural grounds is not allowed .
one deeply religious couple , who had tried to home-school their five children , is now seeking asylum in the us , saying the german school attendance laws persecute them for their religion .
last year a duesseldorf court ruled that a 12-year-old muslim schoolgirl must take part in co-educational swimming lessons at her school , despite her parents ' objections on religious grounds to their daughter wearing close-fitting clothing .
although the most recent federal court decision applies to all of germany , which specific classes a school offers is ultimately decided at the state level .
thus , while the sexual education programs might vary from state to state , no schoolchild attending school in germany can skip any sort of class or subject – be it physical education , biology or math – for religious reasons. hf / dpa / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?

are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .

those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .

a spokeswoman for the german health ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with germany 's 16 federal states over the next few weeks .
germany 's largest health insurer , aok , has already suggested setting up four “ vaccination sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of schleswig-holstein within a very short space of time .

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?

are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 07.08.2009 us missile strike kills key pakistani taliban leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud was killed by a suspected us missile strike the foreign minister of pakistan , shah mehmud qureshi , has confirmed reports that pakistan ’ s most wanted militant , baitullah mehsud , has been killed in a suspected us drone strike . baitullah mehsud , who was born into the mehsud clan of south waziristan on the border with afghanistan , first rose to prominence in 2003 and 2004 .
at that time , he commanded just 20 to 25 fighters but he was overshadowed by another leader from his clan - abdullah mehsud , who was believed to be his brother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah mehsud , left , a former guantanamo bay prisoner , is believed to have been baitullah 's brother " abdullah mehsud was a returnee from the guantanamo bay and had also fought in afghanistan .
therefore , he had a certain aura about him , " explained retired brigadier mehmood shah , the former security chief of pakistan 's troubled northwest .
" baitullah was young and much more dedicated towards the taliban ideology .
he was much more sincere in his work , " he added .
baitullah mehsud 's rise to the top shah added that baitullah mehsud wanted to meet him in laddah in south waziristan in 2004 but he refused because he did not consider him to be important enough . " i told him to see the assistant political agent , " he said .
when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .
he apparently opposed abdullah 's decision to kidnap two chinese engineers in 2004 .
" due to his recklessness , abdullah mehsud became anti-government and sidelined , " explained shah .
" whereas baitullah started recruiting more and more people as his fighters .
finally , he was the one who concluded an agreement with the government in 2005 .
abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "
shrewd negotiator baitullah mehsud became an undisputed leader in the area and in the end he followed the same course as abdullah .
however , he was shrewder in his dealings with the government : he forged agreements with the authorities when he was weak and dictated terms to them when he was strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehsud is believed to have been behind the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto he had been blamed for a wave of attacks in pakistan in recent years , including the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto in december 2007 and the bombing of the marriott hotel in islamabad in 2008 .
he always denied any involvement in bhutto 's death .
number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .
it is only six months ago that the americans became more convinced that he appeared to be heading the al-qaeda efforts against the pakistan government . "
experts believe that baitullah mehsud 's successor will need a considerable amount of time to establish his authority over the thousands of taliban members in northwest pakistan .

in its financial rescue package , the german government put a 500,000-euro limit on salaries for board of director members and said bonuses would not be paid at institutes that receive federal bailout funds .
westlb had received 100 million euros in state aid from the north rhine-westphalia treasury , which also supports the bank with an additional security of two billion euros , public broadcaster ard 's " panorama " program said .
in baden-wuerttemberg , the state parliament gave a five-billion-euro boost to the lbbw on the condition that it limited managers ' salaries to 500,000 euros as long as the bank maintained a negative balance sheet .
media reports that leading executives at dresdner bank were paid millions of euros in bonuses sparked a debate earlier in the year in germany about managers ' payments .
dresdner was taken over by commerzbank , which has also received billions in state aid. nda / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

membership in a foreign terror organization carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
the group features on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states .
as part of a plea agreement in which they confessed to involvement with the group , hasan s. -lrb- 46 -rrb- was sentenced to two years and 11 months in prison .
mustafa a. -lrb- 52 -rrb- and ilhan d. -lrb- 40 -rrb- who were also convicted of forging documents , were given five years and three-and-a-half years respectively .
hasan s. and mustafa a. are turkish nationals .
ilhan d. is a german national of turkish origin .

in its financial rescue package , the german government put a 500,000-euro limit on salaries for board of director members and said bonuses would not be paid at institutes that receive federal bailout funds .
westlb had received 100 million euros in state aid from the north rhine-westphalia treasury , which also supports the bank with an additional security of two billion euros , public broadcaster ard 's " panorama " program said .
in baden-wuerttemberg , the state parliament gave a five-billion-euro boost to the lbbw on the condition that it limited managers ' salaries to 500,000 euros as long as the bank maintained a negative balance sheet .
media reports that leading executives at dresdner bank were paid millions of euros in bonuses sparked a debate earlier in the year in germany about managers ' payments .
dresdner was taken over by commerzbank , which has also received billions in state aid. nda / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .

are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 07.08.2009 no one wants to foot the swine flu vaccination bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flu season in europe starts in september pharmaceutical companies will profit greatly when germany ’ s biggest immunization program in half a century gets underway in a few weeks .
health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't come in if you think you 've got swine flu ! "
are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .
meanwhile , it has been determined that a so-called pcr test , which could confirm if someone has swine flu , is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases .
the test failed to detect the presence of swine flu in half of all cases .
chaos feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will be immunized first ?
berlin plans to immunize millions of citizens in a very short time to beat the start of the flu season . the dstgb fears being overwhelmed with the task .
it says the government 's draft vaccination plan has not been carefully thought through and warns of confusion due to a poor allocation of responsibilities .
it has called for local health authorities , doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the government 's specific plans .
a spokeswoman for the german health ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with germany 's 16 federal states over the next few weeks .
germany 's largest health insurer , aok , has already suggested setting up four “ vaccination sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of schleswig-holstein within a very short space of time .
vaccine still untested meanwhile , pharmaceutical companies , including sanofi pasteur , novartis and csl are producing the vaccine at top speed .
but , although vaccinations are set to begin in the fall , final clinical tests could take more than a year .
prodution of the swine flu vaccine will not be able to meet worldwide demand .

when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .

abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "

number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .

at that time , he commanded just 20 to 25 fighters but he was overshadowed by another leader from his clan - abdullah mehsud , who was believed to be his brother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah mehsud , left , a former guantanamo bay prisoner , is believed to have been baitullah 's brother " abdullah mehsud was a returnee from the guantanamo bay and had also fought in afghanistan .
therefore , he had a certain aura about him , " explained retired brigadier mehmood shah , the former security chief of pakistan 's troubled northwest .
" baitullah was young and much more dedicated towards the taliban ideology .
he was much more sincere in his work , " he added .
baitullah mehsud 's rise to the top shah added that baitullah mehsud wanted to meet him in laddah in south waziristan in 2004 but he refused because he did not consider him to be important enough . " i told him to see the assistant political agent , " he said .
when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .
he apparently opposed abdullah 's decision to kidnap two chinese engineers in 2004 .
" due to his recklessness , abdullah mehsud became anti-government and sidelined , " explained shah .
" whereas baitullah started recruiting more and more people as his fighters .
finally , he was the one who concluded an agreement with the government in 2005 .
abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "
shrewd negotiator baitullah mehsud became an undisputed leader in the area and in the end he followed the same course as abdullah .
however , he was shrewder in his dealings with the government : he forged agreements with the authorities when he was weak and dictated terms to them when he was strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehsud is believed to have been behind the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto he had been blamed for a wave of attacks in pakistan in recent years , including the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto in december 2007 and the bombing of the marriott hotel in islamabad in 2008 .
he always denied any involvement in bhutto 's death .
number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .
it is only six months ago that the americans became more convinced that he appeared to be heading the al-qaeda efforts against the pakistan government . "
experts believe that baitullah mehsud 's successor will need a considerable amount of time to establish his authority over the thousands of taliban members in northwest pakistan .

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

in its financial rescue package , the german government put a 500,000-euro limit on salaries for board of director members and said bonuses would not be paid at institutes that receive federal bailout funds .
westlb had received 100 million euros in state aid from the north rhine-westphalia treasury , which also supports the bank with an additional security of two billion euros , public broadcaster ard 's " panorama " program said .
in baden-wuerttemberg , the state parliament gave a five-billion-euro boost to the lbbw on the condition that it limited managers ' salaries to 500,000 euros as long as the bank maintained a negative balance sheet .
media reports that leading executives at dresdner bank were paid millions of euros in bonuses sparked a debate earlier in the year in germany about managers ' payments .
dresdner was taken over by commerzbank , which has also received billions in state aid. nda / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 07.08.2009 parliamentarians fail to reveal arms lobby ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag rules say politicians must reveal memberships several german parliamentarians have come under pressure after reports said they concealed their memberships in military associations close to the country 's arms lobby . five members of the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , have held senior positions at the german society for military technology -lrb- dwt -rrb- and the association of the german army -lrb- fkh -rrb- without making public their membership in the bodies , according to german news agency dpa .
parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .
the four social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and one free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- are all members of the bundestag 's defense committee .
elke hoff -lrb- fdp -rrb- , rainer arnold and joern thiessen held seats on the steering committee of the dwt .
gerd hoefer and johannes kahrs were members of the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentarians can get heavy fines for concealing facts " membership in the steering committee is voluntary .
because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are concerned about military influence in the bundestag the spd politician ulrike merten , who could become germany 's next defense minister should the social democrats win the coming general election , is a declared member of the board of the dwt .
anti-lobby groups warn against leniency critics of lobby groups said that the alleged forgetfulness or misunderstandings of those who failed to reveal their connections to military associations should not be used to cover up the seriousness of the oversight .
" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at that time , he commanded just 20 to 25 fighters but he was overshadowed by another leader from his clan - abdullah mehsud , who was believed to be his brother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah mehsud , left , a former guantanamo bay prisoner , is believed to have been baitullah 's brother " abdullah mehsud was a returnee from the guantanamo bay and had also fought in afghanistan .
therefore , he had a certain aura about him , " explained retired brigadier mehmood shah , the former security chief of pakistan 's troubled northwest .
" baitullah was young and much more dedicated towards the taliban ideology .
he was much more sincere in his work , " he added .
baitullah mehsud 's rise to the top shah added that baitullah mehsud wanted to meet him in laddah in south waziristan in 2004 but he refused because he did not consider him to be important enough . " i told him to see the assistant political agent , " he said .
when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .
he apparently opposed abdullah 's decision to kidnap two chinese engineers in 2004 .
" due to his recklessness , abdullah mehsud became anti-government and sidelined , " explained shah .
" whereas baitullah started recruiting more and more people as his fighters .
finally , he was the one who concluded an agreement with the government in 2005 .
abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "
shrewd negotiator baitullah mehsud became an undisputed leader in the area and in the end he followed the same course as abdullah .
however , he was shrewder in his dealings with the government : he forged agreements with the authorities when he was weak and dictated terms to them when he was strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehsud is believed to have been behind the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto he had been blamed for a wave of attacks in pakistan in recent years , including the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto in december 2007 and the bombing of the marriott hotel in islamabad in 2008 .
he always denied any involvement in bhutto 's death .
number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .
it is only six months ago that the americans became more convinced that he appeared to be heading the al-qaeda efforts against the pakistan government . "
experts believe that baitullah mehsud 's successor will need a considerable amount of time to establish his authority over the thousands of taliban members in northwest pakistan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah mehsud , left , a former guantanamo bay prisoner , is believed to have been baitullah 's brother " abdullah mehsud was a returnee from the guantanamo bay and had also fought in afghanistan .
therefore , he had a certain aura about him , " explained retired brigadier mehmood shah , the former security chief of pakistan 's troubled northwest .
" baitullah was young and much more dedicated towards the taliban ideology .
he was much more sincere in his work , " he added .
baitullah mehsud 's rise to the top shah added that baitullah mehsud wanted to meet him in laddah in south waziristan in 2004 but he refused because he did not consider him to be important enough . " i told him to see the assistant political agent , " he said .
when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .
he apparently opposed abdullah 's decision to kidnap two chinese engineers in 2004 .
" due to his recklessness , abdullah mehsud became anti-government and sidelined , " explained shah .
" whereas baitullah started recruiting more and more people as his fighters .
finally , he was the one who concluded an agreement with the government in 2005 .
abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "
shrewd negotiator baitullah mehsud became an undisputed leader in the area and in the end he followed the same course as abdullah .
however , he was shrewder in his dealings with the government : he forged agreements with the authorities when he was weak and dictated terms to them when he was strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehsud is believed to have been behind the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto he had been blamed for a wave of attacks in pakistan in recent years , including the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto in december 2007 and the bombing of the marriott hotel in islamabad in 2008 .
he always denied any involvement in bhutto 's death .
number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .
it is only six months ago that the americans became more convinced that he appeared to be heading the al-qaeda efforts against the pakistan government . "
experts believe that baitullah mehsud 's successor will need a considerable amount of time to establish his authority over the thousands of taliban members in northwest pakistan .

professional photographer thomas struth teamed up with homeless vendors in dusseldorf to reveal another side of the city . click on the link below to see photographs from the exhibition . thomas struth and rudolf druschke are an unlikely combination .
one is an internationally acclaimed artist and germany 's most famous photographer .
the other earns his living by selling fifty-fifty , a dusseldorf-based street magazine created to provide an income for its homeless vendors . druschke first met struth five years ago , at the start of the project now known as " homeless people photograph passers-by . "
the idea was to give fifty-fifty sellers a camera and to ask them to photograph their world - the streets they stand on day after day and the people who pass them by . struth himself gave on-the-job master classes to the participants , whose work is now on show in dusseldorf 's stadtmuseum . " he was a complete perfectionist , " said druschke of struth .
" i 'd take photo after photo , but he 'd still ask me to try again . " success story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street vendor rudolf druschke always has a smile for his customers druschke 's pitch is in downtown dusseldorf , near the woolsworths convenient store .
in his mid-fifties with a gentle face , intelligent eyes and a warm smile , he 's something of a local treasure .
he has built up a base of loyal customers who come to him as much for his advice as for his newspaper . " thomas struth seemed outraged that i could have ended up on the streets , " said druschke .
" he kept asking how it was possible .
i think he learned a lot from the project - a lot about people . " druschke 's story is typical of many of the project 's participants : a family tragedy led to alcoholism , an addiction which cost him first his job , then his home and his relationship with his wife and children . encouraged by the friendship and support of his customers , however , druschke has now turned his life around .
he has a new partner and is working on a book which , he said , is both an autobiography and a collection of stories about the people he meets on the street .
one day , he hopes his children will read it and understand . a different view others have not been so lucky .
several of the homeless people who contributed to the exhibition have since died as a result of drug and alcohol abuse .
for many more , life on the streets remains a daily struggle . " homeless people photograph passers-by " offers a portrait of the city - seen through the eyes of those who are normally invisible . often the photographs show shoppers walking briskly past , oblivious to the presence of the homeless person with the camera .
others are affectionate portraits of favorite customers - a woman proudly stroking her pregnant belly , another so close up to the camera that her " in-your-face " personality jumps out of the frame . " life on the streets is hard , " said druschke , " but a friendly face can make all the difference .

but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

in its financial rescue package , the german government put a 500,000-euro limit on salaries for board of director members and said bonuses would not be paid at institutes that receive federal bailout funds .
westlb had received 100 million euros in state aid from the north rhine-westphalia treasury , which also supports the bank with an additional security of two billion euros , public broadcaster ard 's " panorama " program said .
in baden-wuerttemberg , the state parliament gave a five-billion-euro boost to the lbbw on the condition that it limited managers ' salaries to 500,000 euros as long as the bank maintained a negative balance sheet .
media reports that leading executives at dresdner bank were paid millions of euros in bonuses sparked a debate earlier in the year in germany about managers ' payments .
dresdner was taken over by commerzbank , which has also received billions in state aid. nda / dpa / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 07.08.2009 no one wants to foot the swine flu vaccination bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flu season in europe starts in september pharmaceutical companies will profit greatly when germany ’ s biggest immunization program in half a century gets underway in a few weeks .
health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't come in if you think you 've got swine flu ! "
are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .
meanwhile , it has been determined that a so-called pcr test , which could confirm if someone has swine flu , is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases .
the test failed to detect the presence of swine flu in half of all cases .
chaos feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will be immunized first ?
berlin plans to immunize millions of citizens in a very short time to beat the start of the flu season . the dstgb fears being overwhelmed with the task .
it says the government 's draft vaccination plan has not been carefully thought through and warns of confusion due to a poor allocation of responsibilities .
it has called for local health authorities , doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the government 's specific plans .
a spokeswoman for the german health ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with germany 's 16 federal states over the next few weeks .
germany 's largest health insurer , aok , has already suggested setting up four “ vaccination sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of schleswig-holstein within a very short space of time .
vaccine still untested meanwhile , pharmaceutical companies , including sanofi pasteur , novartis and csl are producing the vaccine at top speed .
but , although vaccinations are set to begin in the fall , final clinical tests could take more than a year .
prodution of the swine flu vaccine will not be able to meet worldwide demand .
to make the most efficient use of the doses available , the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- said in a press conference in geneva on thursday , that countries in the northern hemisphere should be the first to get the vaccine in september or october , when the flu season starts there .
the who added that doctors and nurses in the southern hemisphere should also be among the first people to receive swine flu shots. wl / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 1,200 people are needed to take part in the trials .

at that time , he commanded just 20 to 25 fighters but he was overshadowed by another leader from his clan - abdullah mehsud , who was believed to be his brother .

" baitullah was young and much more dedicated towards the taliban ideology .

baitullah mehsud 's rise to the top shah added that baitullah mehsud wanted to meet him in laddah in south waziristan in 2004 but he refused because he did not consider him to be important enough . " i told him to see the assistant political agent , " he said .
when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .
he apparently opposed abdullah 's decision to kidnap two chinese engineers in 2004 .
" due to his recklessness , abdullah mehsud became anti-government and sidelined , " explained shah .
" whereas baitullah started recruiting more and more people as his fighters .
finally , he was the one who concluded an agreement with the government in 2005 .
abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "
shrewd negotiator baitullah mehsud became an undisputed leader in the area and in the end he followed the same course as abdullah .

number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .
it is only six months ago that the americans became more convinced that he appeared to be heading the al-qaeda efforts against the pakistan government . "
experts believe that baitullah mehsud 's successor will need a considerable amount of time to establish his authority over the thousands of taliban members in northwest pakistan .

at that time , he commanded just 20 to 25 fighters but he was overshadowed by another leader from his clan - abdullah mehsud , who was believed to be his brother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah mehsud , left , a former guantanamo bay prisoner , is believed to have been baitullah 's brother " abdullah mehsud was a returnee from the guantanamo bay and had also fought in afghanistan .
therefore , he had a certain aura about him , " explained retired brigadier mehmood shah , the former security chief of pakistan 's troubled northwest .
" baitullah was young and much more dedicated towards the taliban ideology .
he was much more sincere in his work , " he added .
baitullah mehsud 's rise to the top shah added that baitullah mehsud wanted to meet him in laddah in south waziristan in 2004 but he refused because he did not consider him to be important enough . " i told him to see the assistant political agent , " he said .
when abdullah mehsud started targetting the pakistani government and foreigners , baitullah held back .
he apparently opposed abdullah 's decision to kidnap two chinese engineers in 2004 .
" due to his recklessness , abdullah mehsud became anti-government and sidelined , " explained shah .
" whereas baitullah started recruiting more and more people as his fighters .
finally , he was the one who concluded an agreement with the government in 2005 .
abdullah mehsud was excluded from this agreement and was subsequently killed by the army . "
shrewd negotiator baitullah mehsud became an undisputed leader in the area and in the end he followed the same course as abdullah .
however , he was shrewder in his dealings with the government : he forged agreements with the authorities when he was weak and dictated terms to them when he was strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehsud is believed to have been behind the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto he had been blamed for a wave of attacks in pakistan in recent years , including the assassination of former prime minister benazir bhutto in december 2007 and the bombing of the marriott hotel in islamabad in 2008 .
he always denied any involvement in bhutto 's death .
number one al-qaeda man analysts think that mehsud started developing close ties with al-qaeda about a year ago . " he was considered as the number one al-qaeda man in pakistan , " said brigadier shah .
" but the us government was not convinced - it did not target the area where baitullah mehsud was at first .
it is only six months ago that the americans became more convinced that he appeared to be heading the al-qaeda efforts against the pakistan government . "
experts believe that baitullah mehsud 's successor will need a considerable amount of time to establish his authority over the thousands of taliban members in northwest pakistan .

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .

" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .

the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .

parliamentary regulations require lawmakers to declare any membership in organizations .

because no money is paid , i forgot to disclose it , " said thiessen .
parliamentarians claim honorary roles do n't count hoefer and kahrs also said they believed the status of their fkh membership meant they were not obliged to declare them to the bundestag .
" the activity is voluntary , so it does not need to be revealed , " said hoefer .
kahrs justified his silence over his fkh role by stating that treasurers or chairmen of associations did not have to reveal their membership to the bundestag .
both hoefer and kahrs have since officially declared their memberships according to the bundestag policy .
the bundestag regulations state that parliamentarians are obligated " to disclose functions in associations of trade and industry and prohibited from accepting any remuneration for the exercise of -lsb- that -rsb- office other than that provided for by law . "
failure to reveal memberships can lead to disciplinary action being taken against the parliamentarian and can include fines as high as half of his or her annual salary .
members of the bundestag currently receive 7,668 euros -lrb- $ 11,014 -rrb- per month in parliamentary allowance .
other parliamentarians who belong in the two military associations had declared their membership in line with the bundestag regulations .
they include deputy defense minister thomas kossendey -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who is vice president of the dwt , and agriculture minister ilse aigner , who is on the fkh steering committee .

" in the associations and companies named , there is influence on behalf of the federal armed forces , " said ulrich mueller of the organization for lobby control .
" to that extent , the membership in committees of such lobby platforms must be made public to all . "
mueller added that some of the responsibility must lie with the bundestag administration which he considers to be too lenient in imposing sanctions on parliamentarians. nda / dpa / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .

where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?

are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .
meanwhile , it has been determined that a so-called pcr test , which could confirm if someone has swine flu , is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases .

it has called for local health authorities , doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the government 's specific plans .
a spokeswoman for the german health ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with germany 's 16 federal states over the next few weeks .
germany 's largest health insurer , aok , has already suggested setting up four “ vaccination sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of schleswig-holstein within a very short space of time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 07.08.2009 europe 's poorest country reveals its hidden riches großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to moldova and its capital chisinau than meets the eye moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about the hidden riches he found there . the former soviet republic of moldova gained its independence in 1991 .
it has been in the news recently because of elections in which pro-western opposition parties gained an upper hand over the ruling communists .
yet moldova is still a largely unknown spot on the map – usually described as the europe 's poorest country and one of it 's most corrupt .
miles ashdown has this postcard about life in this country of about 4.5 million people .
i live in romania .
more specifically , i live in the moldovan region of romania , right next to the border of the republic of moldova .
so , i expected to find a lot of similarities when i crossed over the border into romania 's neighbor to the east to report on the moldovan parliamentary elections at the end of july .
geographically , the landscape was about the same : farmland , hills , sunflowers and vineyards .
it 's charming and rustic .
little communities line the main roads , their houses surrounded by flowers and vegetables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of moldova is still very rural ...
meanwhile , moldova 's largest city , the capital chisinau , is lively , but has n't reached the extreme of pollution , traffic and indifferent attitudes that you 'll find in romania 's bucharest .
romania and moldova share essentially the same language , romanian , which is called moldovan across the border .
but there are millions in moldova who speak russian .
i was surprised to find moldovans on a regular basis who did n't seem to know a word of romanian .
thankfully , there 's usually someone around who speaks both languages willing to help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but the capital chisinau is lively this , too , was a similarity with romania .
both romanians and moldovans are unbelievably hospitable .
a moldovan friend drove me outside the capital to stay at his family 's countryside home for a night .
a mouth-watering experience there , i was treated to a delicious spread of local foods .
this included fried eggplant with a savory sauce nicknamed " limba soacrei " – " mother-in-law 's tongue .
we also had rabbit , thanks to my host 's own backyard rabbit farm .
also : " placinta " – a tasty fried sandwich filled with either potatoes or cabbage .
every spare meter on the family 's property seemed to be used to plant some form of vegetable , fruit or flower , putting their rich land to good use .
my hosts joked : " we may not be rich , but we never go hungry . "
we also , of course , had locally produced wine .
it was excellent .
moldova is perhaps known around the world for its wine more than anything else .
violent upheaval but the parliamentary elections in april brought the country into the world spotlight .
violent protests left several people dead , dozens injured and hundreds detained .
demonstrators claimed election fraud during the so-called " twitter revolution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claims of election fraud sparked protests in moldova and neighboring romania this election was big news in romania , in part , because romania was alleged to have played a role in the process .
i do n't doubt it .
i 've seen graffiti in iasi , one of romania 's larger cities , that claims moldova is " pomund romanesc " – romanian land .
mostly , though , i 'd heard moldova described as a dirt poor country at the crossroads between the west and the east , that is , between the eu and russia 's " aear abroad . "
an oversimplification yes , the un reports that about half the country lives below the poverty line .
yes , hundreds of thousands of moldovans have fled their homeland in search of better-paying work elsewhere .
and , yes , " real " unemployment rates are about 25 percent .
but , i found moldova to be an alluring country rich with cultural intricacies that go beyond a clash between west versus east .
i hope i 'll be able to spend more time in this little nation to understand its people and culture even more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 07.08.2009 german soccer booms despite recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis wo n't keep fans from bundesliga matches , but it may make sponsors wary after record attendance last season , bundesliga experts are predicting the german league will attract even more fans this year .
but many teams are still bracing themselves for the full impact of the financial crisis . in business and in soccer , the numbers do n't lie .
and the bundesliga , for the most part , can be proud of the numbers it 's producing .
one of the key figures is 41,904 – the average number of fans that attended bundesliga matches last season .
sports analysts expect the size of the crowds will continue to grow this season as well .
in fact , the bundesliga is the healthiest league in the world in terms of average match attendance .
not coincidentally , the bundesliga was recently ranked along with france 's ligue 1 as europe 's most exciting competition in a study by ernst and young 's sports business unit , score team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern stadiums help draw fans to bundesliga matches .
" you can see that the bundesliga is a more suspenseful league because in the last three years , we 've had three different german champions , " arnd hovemann , an author of the study , told deutsche welle .
" the distance between the top teams and the rest is n't as big .
in comparison , fc barcelona has already secured spain 's championship eight or nine match days before the season ends . "
newer stadiums a big draw another reason the bundesliga draws so many fans is the typically positive game-day experience .
the source of this phenomenon dates back to 2000 , when soccer 's world governing body fifa named germany as the host country for the 2006 world cup . german organizers ' efforts to improve fan safety and comfort triggered a demographic shift in bundesliga crowds .
" you do n't have to worry about hooliganism or a dangerous situation , " stefan ludwig , a sports business expert at deloitte germany , told deutsche welle .
" you have very good quality food and beverage services , and these are all factors which count , in particular for families , if you go to a football match . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women now make up about a quarter of bundesliga crowds women are also becoming more of a presence in german soccer stadiums .
arnd hovemann from ernst and young says that women now make up around a quarter of a typical match audience .
that 's a development other european leagues – italy in particular – have n't been able to replicate .
" if you look at this in italy , where they have the worst stadium infrastructure , certain stadiums do n't even have women 's restrooms , " hovemann said .
bundesliga not bulletproof against financial crisis despite strong season ticket sales and a surge in popularity among new market segments , about half of the bundesliga managers surveyed by ernst and young expect the league 's financial situation to deteriorate this year .
although a strong fan base means that teams ' incomes from ticket sales , merchandise and media rights are relatively secure , managers are worried about a potential downturn in sponsorship deals .
sponsors generally provide teams with about 25 percent of their revenue .
but with the financial crisis forcing many german companies to cut costs , managers are likely to think twice about tying money up in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : " all the sponsors are reviewing their marketing budgets , " said deloitte 's stefan ludwig .
" so there might be cuts in marketing budgets , which will also relate to sponsors .
therefore it might be difficult , in particular for smaller -lsb- teams -rsb- , to generate the same amount as they had last year . "
according to hovemann , fans will have to wait a while to see how much the financial crisis will affect the bundesliga .
given the league 's strong fan base and generally conservative financial strategy , he thinks german soccer should fare well in the long run .
" the majority of managers predict a decrease in income this year , " he said , " but over the next five years , a very large majority of managers expect an increase in income .
the current situation is not surprising in light of the global economic crisis and should not hold the league back for long . "

health insurers are increasingly skeptical of berlin ’ s plans . plans announced by the german government last month to vaccinate 25 million people against swine flu this autumn are increasingly coming under attack .
officials have ordered 50 million units of vaccine , since each person must be innoculated twice .
berlin estimates the immunization program will cost 600 million euros -lrb- $ 850 million -rrb- , although health insurance companies argue that one billion euros is more realistic .
where to send the bill ?
one big unanswered question remains ; who will pay for the immunization program ?
berlin has said the health insurance companies must bear the costs , while they , in turn , have threatened to raise their premiums or impose a surcharge on patients .
the federal association of local authorities -lrb- dstgb -rrb- insists its members should not have to pay for the vaccinations .
consumer and employer associations have also warned against attempting to pass on immunization costs . " it 's poison for employment , especially during this economic crisis , " said the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- in a statement . is the effort worthwhile ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't come in if you think you 've got swine flu ! "
are all these protective measures really necessary ? the benefits of such a massive program have not been adequately substantiated , according to professor gerd glaeske , who researches pharmaceutical applications at the center for social politics at the university of bremen .
“ vaccinations are not a panacea , ” glaeske said .
some critics even suggest that much of the hysteria over a possible swine flu epidemic has been artificially created .
they point to the very limited number of swine flu infections in germany , none of which have been fatal . “ this is huge business for the pharmaceutical industry , ” said social democrat deputy , wolfgang wodarg .
" the swine flu outbreak is no different from a normal flu outbreak " , he told the neue presse newspaper in hanover .
“ quite the opposite , if you compare the number of swine flu cases with other flu outbreaks .
it 's ridiculous , ” he added .
the government plan , so far the german health ministry late last month announced a draft plan outlining who will be immunized first .
those suffering from asthma , bronchitis , diabetes , certain immune deficiencies including hiv infections , or heart , liver and kidney ailments top the list , as well as pregnant women and the obese .
healthcare workers and public employees are also high on the list .
meanwhile , it has been determined that a so-called pcr test , which could confirm if someone has swine flu , is too unreliable to be used except in extreme cases .
the test failed to detect the presence of swine flu in half of all cases .
chaos feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will be immunized first ?
berlin plans to immunize millions of citizens in a very short time to beat the start of the flu season . the dstgb fears being overwhelmed with the task .
it says the government 's draft vaccination plan has not been carefully thought through and warns of confusion due to a poor allocation of responsibilities .
it has called for local health authorities , doctors and clinics to be urgently informed of the government 's specific plans .
a spokeswoman for the german health ministry said vaccination agreements will be finalized with germany 's 16 federal states over the next few weeks .
germany 's largest health insurer , aok , has already suggested setting up four “ vaccination sundays ” in order to carry out the massive task of immunizing 680,000 people in the northern state of schleswig-holstein within a very short space of time .
vaccine still untested meanwhile , pharmaceutical companies , including sanofi pasteur , novartis and csl are producing the vaccine at top speed .
but , although vaccinations are set to begin in the fall , final clinical tests could take more than a year .
prodution of the swine flu vaccine will not be able to meet worldwide demand .
to make the most efficient use of the doses available , the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- said in a press conference in geneva on thursday , that countries in the northern hemisphere should be the first to get the vaccine in september or october , when the flu season starts there .
the who added that doctors and nurses in the southern hemisphere should also be among the first people to receive swine flu shots. wl / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

residents of the two neighboring villages of fiesch and fieschertal took a solemn vow way back in 1678 to lead good and blameless lives in exchange for god 's protection against being swallowed by europe 's largest glacier as it grew towards their valley .
to reinforce their prayers , they started holding an annual procession in 1862 , when the glacier reached its longest point during the mini ice age europe suffered in the mid-19th century .
perhaps occasionally some members of the community slipped up because the villages have suffered " countless , horrible natural catastrophes " during the last three hundred years , according to the local pastor , reverend pascal venetz .
but they took their vow very seriously .
female inhabitants were even once forbidden to wear colored underwear lest it might provoke the glacier .
glacier is melting rapidly due to global warming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope is taking the request seriously now , however , the villages have the reverse problem .
instead of dreading that the great aletsch glacier will swallow them , the ice mountain is now melting at such a rate that it is feared that flooding will one day destroy all the homes in the valley .
the glacier base is shrinking up the mountain by some 30 meters annually , according to the conservation body pro natura .
it is estimated that the river of ice has retreated some 3.4 kilometers since peaking in 1860 at a length of 23 kilometers . nearly half the shrinkage has taken place since 1950 .
vows are made to be changed the mayor of fiesch , herbert volken , came up with the idea of trying to alter the vow after witnessing changes in the glacier and its surrounding environment .
reverend venetz said he would ask the local bishop to seek pope benedict xvi 's permission to change the vow , so that god could now be asked to reverse the effects of global warming which is being blamed for the thaw .
it appears the request is being taken seriously .
a statement from the cantonal government of valais , where the villages are situated , said a papal audience was planned for september or october. td / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting will be the final public event held by the all wales convention to gauge views on whether there is an appetite for more powers .
the session follows 23 events across wales attended by almost 2,000 people since they began a year ago .
a report on the consultation process will be presented to the assembly .
the event will be chaired by sir emyr jones parry , and he will be joined by two other members of the convention .
" we are now approaching the end of the road for the public consultation element of our work , but as a convention we have a long way to go yet , " said sir emyr .
over the past year the controversy over mps ' expenses has affected the debate , he said , with a general loss of faith in politicians .
" we have held city centre roadshows , question time-style events and family days in community centres , discussing the issues with people who had seldom engaged in political debate , " said sir emyr .
the convention 's final report is due to go to the assembly government before the end of the year so a decision can be taken on whether to hold a referendum on more law-making powers .
the event will be held on the welsh assembly government stand between 1400 - 1500 bst .
