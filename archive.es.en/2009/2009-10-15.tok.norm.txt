the anti-nuclear activists said the remaining 90 percent was stored in siberia , outdoors and in rusting containers .
uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .

the solar industry , however , is warning against taking drastic steps . in coalition talks , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have discussed drastically slashing renewable energy subsidies as the industry becomes more efficient .
" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .
this is a schedule both the economic and the environmental committees of the upcoming coalition could agree on . costs for solar plants have dropped according to holger krawinkel , an energy expert at the federation of german consumer organizations , cuts are necessary for compensation for selling solar power back to the public grid . " if costs for solar plants drop by 30 percent , then it 's not quite logical why the compensation should n't be proportionately reduced , " he said .
" our demands have been met : the plants have gotten cheaper ; the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- planned a reduction anyway . " carsten koernig , executive director of the german solar industry association , said subsidies to the industry are cut by 10 percent each year as it is .
this was appropriate , considering that the industry had been able to cut its costs by 50 percent since 2000 , he added . " now the question is : are there even bigger margins ?
we warn against large-scale changes , " said koernig , who conceded that the new government may want to assess the need for change , considering the recent cost cuts . large-scale reductions , however , could have a negative impact on customers ' willingness to make the initial investment in solar panels , should the compensation for selling back to the grid be slashed too drastrically . however , koernig said he suspects another motive : " we all know that -lsb- the german government -rsb- mainly want to implement longer runs for nuclear power facilities . " bildunterschrift : the solar industry has drastically reduced the cost of panels in recent years selling energy to the public grid solar energy customers who have installed solar cells at home and feed energy into the public grid are now getting paid a hefty 43 cents -lrb- $ 0.64 -rrb- per kilowatt hour as an incentive to purchase the initial solar set-up . the costs of subsidies is passed on to all electricity consumers , said koernig . " this leads to an increase of the electricity tariff by 0.5 percent , " he added .
in comparison , the energy wasted by leaving electronic devices in stand-by mode adds up to 10 percent of an average customer 's bill . some are claiming this amount is too high .
according to krawinkel , the subsidy should drop proportionally .

the controversial block on child porn websites will be lifted and new rules will affect police powers .
there are new breakthroughs in the ongoing coalition negotiations in the new german government ahead of decisive talks scheduled this weekend .
negotiators for both parties announced agreements in the areas of internal security that suggested that the fdp 's libertarian agenda is forcing concessions from the conservative cdu .
on the question of website blocks , an initiative introduced by cdu family minister ursula van der leyen earlier this year to combat child pornography , the two parties agreed to try to delete rather than block offending websites .
in a year 's time , the success of the deletion policy will be assessed .
police powers curbed important agreements are designed to curtail police powers : cdu interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced that the use of stored private data in police investigations would be limited to extremely dangerous situations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn sites are to be deleted rather than blocked the police will also have to apply to the federal public prosecutor to conduct secret online searches of computers , rather than local district courts .
the power to conduct online searches will not be extended to other security authorities like the secret service .
the free liberals could also record some success in the question of the protection of professional secrets .
under the new government agenda , all lawyers , not only criminal defense lawyers , will be allowed to withhold sensitive information from the police on professional grounds .
an official enquiry will be initiated to decide whether a similar rule can cover journalists .
prison sentences extended in addition , the two parties agreed that the maximum prison sentence for murder in the case of young criminals would be extended from 10 to 15 years .
a so-called " warning-shot-detention " of up to four weeks will also be introduced for young criminals placed on probation .
fdp domestic policy spokesman max stadler declared that he had expected the cdu bow to the fdp 's demands on certain issues .

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .
merkel herself has called nuclear power " an important bridge technology " on the way to cleaner and safer power for future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to see nuclear plants shut down nuclear power unpopular but vital nuclear power is highly unpopular in germany , with shipments of nuclear waste regularly triggering angry protests .
the country has no permanent storage site for the waste .
but germany is eager to reduce its dependence on volatile gas and oil imports from russia or the middle east and with only limited domestic resources , nuclear power is a strategically important energy source .
the new government plans , however , are vague , says fdp energy expert gudrun kopp , with details on which reactors will remain on line to be determined at a later date .
german media also report that merkel wants to delay concrete decisions on the nuclear issue until after a key state election in north rhine-westphalia next may , which could lose her party a majority in the upper house of parliament .
business and industry are very much in favor of the move , but environmentalists have vowed street protests , if merkel and the fdp go ahead with their plans. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 15.10.2009 immigrant school graduates disadvantaged in germany , oecd study finds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment is more likely to hit immigrant high school graduates a new study by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- found that high school graduates from an immigrant background have significantly worse chances in the german job market . germany may not be quite the egalitarian meritocracy it might imagine itself .
this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .

zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .
the oecd 's findings on the educational circumstances of immigrants in germany were similar to those of pisa studies. bk / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 15.10.2009 crisis-ridden romania gets finance whizz as prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president basescu nominated a new prime minister thursday romanian president traian basescu nominated central bank adviser and former imf representative lucian croitoru as prime minister on thursday , following a collapse of the government earlier this week in parliament . following the collapse of emil boc 's centre-right government in a no-confidence vote , economics expert lucian croitoru became romania 's new prime minister on thursday .
he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .
romania 's troubled economy romania has gone through a sharp economic reversal in the past year , because of the global financial crisis and failed economic policies .
it turned from being the european union 's fastest-growing economy and an attractive target for foreign investors to a problem zone in desperate need of aid .
the imf , the world bank and the eu agreed to lend romania 20 billion euros in exchange for reforms , including an overhaul of its pension system and pledges to cut the public deficit , which is expected to top 7.3 percent of gross domestic product this year. bk / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "

iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .

croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .
romania 's troubled economy romania has gone through a sharp economic reversal in the past year , because of the global financial crisis and failed economic policies .
it turned from being the european union 's fastest-growing economy and an attractive target for foreign investors to a problem zone in desperate need of aid .
the imf , the world bank and the eu agreed to lend romania 20 billion euros in exchange for reforms , including an overhaul of its pension system and pledges to cut the public deficit , which is expected to top 7.3 percent of gross domestic product this year. bk / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .
the plant was used to produce fuel for nuclear power stations in france , which has the second largest network of nuclear facilities after the united states. dfm / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .
merkel herself has called nuclear power " an important bridge technology " on the way to cleaner and safer power for future generations .

but germany is eager to reduce its dependence on volatile gas and oil imports from russia or the middle east and with only limited domestic resources , nuclear power is a strategically important energy source .
the new government plans , however , are vague , says fdp energy expert gudrun kopp , with details on which reactors will remain on line to be determined at a later date .
german media also report that merkel wants to delay concrete decisions on the nuclear issue until after a key state election in north rhine-westphalia next may , which could lose her party a majority in the upper house of parliament .

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , turkey is still a long way from meeting the eu 's criteria for entry . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats agreed " unanimously " to stick with the last government 's position on turkey 's eu membership bid , sources from both parties told afp on thursday .
the previous coalition of the christian democrats with the center-left social democrats had called the negotiations an " open-ended process " with no guarantee of membership .
the deal between the parties is expected be worded in a similar fashion to merkel 's 2005 coalition agreement .
in that document , the parties said " if the eu is not in a position to take on new members or turkey can not fully meet all the criteria necessary for membership , turkey must be bound closely to european structures in a way that allows its privileged relationship with the eu to develop further .

however , turkey is still a long way from meeting the eu 's criteria for entry . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats agreed " unanimously " to stick with the last government 's position on turkey 's eu membership bid , sources from both parties told afp on thursday .
the previous coalition of the christian democrats with the center-left social democrats had called the negotiations an " open-ended process " with no guarantee of membership .

they prefer a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead .
turkey 's disputed eu bid the free democrats , on the other hand , is not against turkey 's membership in principle , but says there are " major deficits " in turkey 's efforts to meet eu criteria for entry .
the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle - who is widely expected to become germany 's new foreign minister - is open to membership , but says turkey first needs to resolve its ongoing dispute with eu-member cyprus and improve rights for the country 's kurds .
turkey has also been criticized for not making sufficient progress in improving its human rights record and reforming the judiciary .
the news of the coalition 's compromise on turkey comes one day after the european commission released its annual progress report on turkey 's bid to join the eu , which gave a mixed review .
whether or not to allow turkey accession into the eu has been a contentious issue in germany - and across europe - since official talks were opened in 2005 .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency i am a us citizen , loyal to my country .
president obama is a talker .
he issues grand visions from his mouth .
in contrast , george bush said little , evoked no praise , but did more to confront the real enemies of peace than has been done by president obama .
the world looks at this talker as a visionary .
i think the world is deceived .
the award of this prize so early cheapens it and is yet another mistake of the committee as was the choice of arafat , gore , and the others nominated in the past . - randolph a. latall , us given that obama has done absolutely nothing to merit the award of any peace prize , never mind the nobel peace prize , simply goes to demonstrate how little value this prize now has beyond the 1.4 million euros to the recipient . it has more to do with adding cachet to the nobel prize via celebrity .
if obama had the slightest moral virtue , he would decline this prize . - charles smyth , great britain i think that he has shown good intentions and improved the atmosphere for peace .
he has only been in office for nine months .
significant actions that he has accomplished were cancelling the missile defense shield , laying the ground work for iran nuclear disarmament and solving the georgia issue with russia .
intentions have been substituted for results . - john reeder , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama won for " efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation " how can anybody be worthy of the nobel peace prize by just laying out a plan but has no hope of ever achieving much of the plan in reality ?
many people realize obama is not any more effective than the former bush administration .
by expanding military operations in afghanistan , he is still listening to diverse lobby groups in washington that advised g. w. bush on a stalled foreign policy ; from the road to peace in the middle east , to nuclear disarmament of countries who should have never been allowed by the un to acquire these weapons of mass destruction . - g. gosau , canada the nobel committee has recognized that president barack obama has set the stage for a worldwide era of enlightenment and peace .
in the 18th century , there was a philosophical wind that swept through the western world . the enlightenment espoused the principles of human dignity , freedom , and government by the people that are prominent in the texts of the declaration of independence and our us constitution .
today we are experiencing the birth of a second " age of enlightenment " which will effect not only western culture but have world-wide influence ; shaping human history for years in the future .
we are no longer satisfied with following leaders that tell us to stop thinking for ourselves but follow their direction on faith .
we are invigorated with dialogue on nuclear disarmament , reconsidering the death penalty , renewable energy , international cooperation , social justice , environmental concerns , education , human rights , universal health care , sex education , religious tolerance , diplomacy and the true implications of the rule of law .
like any change , there is resistance .
new social programs are called communist or socialist to distract the people from real purpose .
investments in our future are bashed as too expensive .
we ca n't let this opportunity slip away , and it will , if we do n't support it in our everyday lives by communicating with our leaders and discussing it with our friends .
it is time for americans to set aside our differences and unite for the common good of all .
president obama has presented us all with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and for that he deserves the nobel prize . - joseph suste , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader thinks chinese president hu jintao was more deserving of the prize it 's official , the international community has lost its collective mind .
obama ?
peace prize ?
what , during his lifetime , has he done to serve the world in the pursuit of peace ?
nothing .
clearly the nobel peace prize should be renamed the " worlds most popular person prize . " frankly , i 'm disgusted . - thor hougen , us i think he deserves it .
he is the first african-american president who gives a hope for all peoples of the world .
here in israel there is anti-obama propaganda , even from the chairman of the israeli parliament .
it is clear that the israeli public was anti-obama during the 2008 us election , it was not his ideology but his skin color . - mequanint birhanu , israel it is quite a recognition for just few months in the oval office .
personally , i like the choice but people who live in former soviet republics are feeling the chilling wind from the east .
without the security blanket of the missile shield , it is going to be cold .
i had president hu jintao as my favorite .
hu has done miracles with putin 's administration .
he made him trade rather than wage war .
hu maintained china 's one child policy risking demographic imbalance at home but globally it was a sound move .
hu is also instrumental at keeping peace in asia pacific region .
he builds roads , railroad , schools and hospitals for africans , instead of filling african corrupt government 's officials pockets with money .
hu is only allowing his people to repossess outer mongolia by peaceful migration .
i hope hu will receive the nobel peace price next year . - paul heinila , canada send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency us president barack obama has won the nobel peace prize .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the award is premature considering that obama has yet to act on his words to solve global conflicts .
-lrb- 09.10.2009 -rrb- obama accepts nobel peace prize as " call to action " us president barack obama said on friday he was " surprised and humbled " at winning the 2009 nobel peace prize and said he accepted the award as a call to action for nations to confront the challenges of the 21st century .

" in addition , there was huge foreign debt incurred in the 1970s , and a runaway inflation of 50 percent a month .

balcerowicz 's bitter pill was a strict monetarist approach , coupled with fast-paced market reforms , which quickly put poland 's house in order .

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .
merkel herself has called nuclear power " an important bridge technology " on the way to cleaner and safer power for future generations .

but germany is eager to reduce its dependence on volatile gas and oil imports from russia or the middle east and with only limited domestic resources , nuclear power is a strategically important energy source .
the new government plans , however , are vague , says fdp energy expert gudrun kopp , with details on which reactors will remain on line to be determined at a later date .
german media also report that merkel wants to delay concrete decisions on the nuclear issue until after a key state election in north rhine-westphalia next may , which could lose her party a majority in the upper house of parliament .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .

reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .

deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?
if the answers to all these turn out to be ' yes ' , then maybe … just maybe … author : nick amies editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?
if the answers to all these turn out to be ' yes ' , then maybe … just maybe … author : nick amies editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ausgestrahlt " reported on wednesday that only 10 percent of that was returned to germany as enriched uranium .
the anti-nuclear activists said the remaining 90 percent was stored in siberia , outdoors and in rusting containers .
uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .
about 10 to 15 percent of the material was treated and returned to germany .
urenco says it has meanwhile terminated cooperation with the russian company . government accused of " nuclear waste tourism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have protested against toxic waste shipments from germany following an inquiry by the left party , the government had already publicly acknowledged the exports in 2007 .
juergen maass , a spokesman for the environment ministry in berlin , on wednesday confirmed the shipments of depleted uranium to russia .
he emphasized that the shipments , although they did contain nuclear waste , were not illegal .
the federal office for radiation protection has said the exports were not subject to approval under the atomic energy act .
opposition parties have renewed criticism of the german government 's policy of exporting nuclear waste .
eva bulling-schroeter , environmental spokeswoman for the left party , called for an end to such shipments : " it is time the government stopped trivializing nuclear waste tourism . "
permanent storage of nuclear waste is not only an unsolved problem and a controversial issue in germany , as it does elsewhere in europe .
in france this week , an arte television documentary and the newspaper liberation said that more than 100 tons of depleted uranium from french power plants have been stored in an open-air complex in siberia .
furthermore , according to an italian environmental organization , at least two dozen ships containing radioactive waste have been sunk in the ionion sea off southern italy in order to bypass local laws. db / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .
the oecd 's findings on the educational circumstances of immigrants in germany were similar to those of pisa studies. bk / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .
the plant was used to produce fuel for nuclear power stations in france , which has the second largest network of nuclear facilities after the united states. dfm / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say he likely never will . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency i am a us citizen , loyal to my country .
president obama is a talker .
he issues grand visions from his mouth .
in contrast , george bush said little , evoked no praise , but did more to confront the real enemies of peace than has been done by president obama .
the world looks at this talker as a visionary .
i think the world is deceived .
the award of this prize so early cheapens it and is yet another mistake of the committee as was the choice of arafat , gore , and the others nominated in the past . - randolph a. latall , us given that obama has done absolutely nothing to merit the award of any peace prize , never mind the nobel peace prize , simply goes to demonstrate how little value this prize now has beyond the 1.4 million euros to the recipient . it has more to do with adding cachet to the nobel prize via celebrity .
if obama had the slightest moral virtue , he would decline this prize . - charles smyth , great britain i think that he has shown good intentions and improved the atmosphere for peace .
he has only been in office for nine months .
significant actions that he has accomplished were cancelling the missile defense shield , laying the ground work for iran nuclear disarmament and solving the georgia issue with russia .
intentions have been substituted for results . - john reeder , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama won for " efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation " how can anybody be worthy of the nobel peace prize by just laying out a plan but has no hope of ever achieving much of the plan in reality ?
many people realize obama is not any more effective than the former bush administration .
by expanding military operations in afghanistan , he is still listening to diverse lobby groups in washington that advised g. w. bush on a stalled foreign policy ; from the road to peace in the middle east , to nuclear disarmament of countries who should have never been allowed by the un to acquire these weapons of mass destruction . - g. gosau , canada the nobel committee has recognized that president barack obama has set the stage for a worldwide era of enlightenment and peace .
in the 18th century , there was a philosophical wind that swept through the western world . the enlightenment espoused the principles of human dignity , freedom , and government by the people that are prominent in the texts of the declaration of independence and our us constitution .
today we are experiencing the birth of a second " age of enlightenment " which will effect not only western culture but have world-wide influence ; shaping human history for years in the future .
we are no longer satisfied with following leaders that tell us to stop thinking for ourselves but follow their direction on faith .
we are invigorated with dialogue on nuclear disarmament , reconsidering the death penalty , renewable energy , international cooperation , social justice , environmental concerns , education , human rights , universal health care , sex education , religious tolerance , diplomacy and the true implications of the rule of law .
like any change , there is resistance .
new social programs are called communist or socialist to distract the people from real purpose .
investments in our future are bashed as too expensive .
we ca n't let this opportunity slip away , and it will , if we do n't support it in our everyday lives by communicating with our leaders and discussing it with our friends .
it is time for americans to set aside our differences and unite for the common good of all .
president obama has presented us all with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and for that he deserves the nobel prize . - joseph suste , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader thinks chinese president hu jintao was more deserving of the prize it 's official , the international community has lost its collective mind .
obama ?
peace prize ?
what , during his lifetime , has he done to serve the world in the pursuit of peace ?
nothing .
clearly the nobel peace prize should be renamed the " worlds most popular person prize . " frankly , i 'm disgusted . - thor hougen , us i think he deserves it .
he is the first african-american president who gives a hope for all peoples of the world .
here in israel there is anti-obama propaganda , even from the chairman of the israeli parliament .
it is clear that the israeli public was anti-obama during the 2008 us election , it was not his ideology but his skin color . - mequanint birhanu , israel it is quite a recognition for just few months in the oval office .
personally , i like the choice but people who live in former soviet republics are feeling the chilling wind from the east .
without the security blanket of the missile shield , it is going to be cold .
i had president hu jintao as my favorite .
hu has done miracles with putin 's administration .
he made him trade rather than wage war .
hu maintained china 's one child policy risking demographic imbalance at home but globally it was a sound move .
hu is also instrumental at keeping peace in asia pacific region .
he builds roads , railroad , schools and hospitals for africans , instead of filling african corrupt government 's officials pockets with money .
hu is only allowing his people to repossess outer mongolia by peaceful migration .
i hope hu will receive the nobel peace price next year . - paul heinila , canada send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency us president barack obama has won the nobel peace prize .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.10.2009 row continues over protestant church memo attacking catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paper attacks pope benedict xvi as incompetent a memorandum by a senior german protestant clergyman heavily criticizing the pope and the catholic church in germany has thrown interfaith relations between the two denominations in the country into turmoil . the paper describes catholic pope benedict xvi as incompetent and unwilling to promote interfaith dialog between protestants and catholics .
it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

" ausgestrahlt " reported on wednesday that only 10 percent of that was returned to germany as enriched uranium .
the anti-nuclear activists said the remaining 90 percent was stored in siberia , outdoors and in rusting containers .
uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .
about 10 to 15 percent of the material was treated and returned to germany .
urenco says it has meanwhile terminated cooperation with the russian company . government accused of " nuclear waste tourism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have protested against toxic waste shipments from germany following an inquiry by the left party , the government had already publicly acknowledged the exports in 2007 .
juergen maass , a spokesman for the environment ministry in berlin , on wednesday confirmed the shipments of depleted uranium to russia .
he emphasized that the shipments , although they did contain nuclear waste , were not illegal .
the federal office for radiation protection has said the exports were not subject to approval under the atomic energy act .
opposition parties have renewed criticism of the german government 's policy of exporting nuclear waste .
eva bulling-schroeter , environmental spokeswoman for the left party , called for an end to such shipments : " it is time the government stopped trivializing nuclear waste tourism . "
permanent storage of nuclear waste is not only an unsolved problem and a controversial issue in germany , as it does elsewhere in europe .
in france this week , an arte television documentary and the newspaper liberation said that more than 100 tons of depleted uranium from french power plants have been stored in an open-air complex in siberia .
furthermore , according to an italian environmental organization , at least two dozen ships containing radioactive waste have been sunk in the ionion sea off southern italy in order to bypass local laws. db / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .
the plant was used to produce fuel for nuclear power stations in france , which has the second largest network of nuclear facilities after the united states. dfm / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , turkey is still a long way from meeting the eu 's criteria for entry . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats agreed " unanimously " to stick with the last government 's position on turkey 's eu membership bid , sources from both parties told afp on thursday .
the previous coalition of the christian democrats with the center-left social democrats had called the negotiations an " open-ended process " with no guarantee of membership .
the deal between the parties is expected be worded in a similar fashion to merkel 's 2005 coalition agreement .
in that document , the parties said " if the eu is not in a position to take on new members or turkey can not fully meet all the criteria necessary for membership , turkey must be bound closely to european structures in a way that allows its privileged relationship with the eu to develop further . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozyand merkel oppose eu membership for turkey many had speculated prior to the talks that the new government would outline a tougher stance against turkey 's eu membership bid , since merkel 's conservatives are strongly opposed to it .
they prefer a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead .
turkey 's disputed eu bid the free democrats , on the other hand , is not against turkey 's membership in principle , but says there are " major deficits " in turkey 's efforts to meet eu criteria for entry .
the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle - who is widely expected to become germany 's new foreign minister - is open to membership , but says turkey first needs to resolve its ongoing dispute with eu-member cyprus and improve rights for the country 's kurds .
turkey has also been criticized for not making sufficient progress in improving its human rights record and reforming the judiciary .
the news of the coalition 's compromise on turkey comes one day after the european commission released its annual progress report on turkey 's bid to join the eu , which gave a mixed review .
whether or not to allow turkey accession into the eu has been a contentious issue in germany - and across europe - since official talks were opened in 2005 .
even those hopeful that turkey will eventually gain entry acknowledge that it could take decades. vj / afp / reuters / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ausgestrahlt " reported on wednesday that only 10 percent of that was returned to germany as enriched uranium .
the anti-nuclear activists said the remaining 90 percent was stored in siberia , outdoors and in rusting containers .
uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .
about 10 to 15 percent of the material was treated and returned to germany .
urenco says it has meanwhile terminated cooperation with the russian company . government accused of " nuclear waste tourism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have protested against toxic waste shipments from germany following an inquiry by the left party , the government had already publicly acknowledged the exports in 2007 .
juergen maass , a spokesman for the environment ministry in berlin , on wednesday confirmed the shipments of depleted uranium to russia .
he emphasized that the shipments , although they did contain nuclear waste , were not illegal .
the federal office for radiation protection has said the exports were not subject to approval under the atomic energy act .
opposition parties have renewed criticism of the german government 's policy of exporting nuclear waste .
eva bulling-schroeter , environmental spokeswoman for the left party , called for an end to such shipments : " it is time the government stopped trivializing nuclear waste tourism . "
permanent storage of nuclear waste is not only an unsolved problem and a controversial issue in germany , as it does elsewhere in europe .
in france this week , an arte television documentary and the newspaper liberation said that more than 100 tons of depleted uranium from french power plants have been stored in an open-air complex in siberia .
furthermore , according to an italian environmental organization , at least two dozen ships containing radioactive waste have been sunk in the ionion sea off southern italy in order to bypass local laws. db / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair literature -pipe- 15.10.2009 bookworms are rare in the land of goethe and schiller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some never pick up a book ; others fly through one a week germans are known around the world for being cultured , but not everyone in the country is necessarily a reader .
a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

it seems that poles ' willingness to travel has n't been impacted by the financial tremors that have hit europe .
in fact , the polish middle class continues to spend like nobody 's business , and foreign travel is high on its list .
jacek dabrowski , financial director of the travel agency triada says that , until 2008 , the polish outbound tourist market grew by 40 percent each year , and this year 's results promise to be better than the european average .

but how do polish tour operators manage to keep their heads above water with competing large german travel companies treating poland as a lucrative market ?
according to dabrowski , the polish companies ' edge lies in their flexibility .
having to build up businesses from scratch and steer them through tough market transformations , polish entrepreneurs have learned to take risks and adapt quickly .

there 's the growing number of foreign direct investments , which last year alone totalled a cool $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.7 billion euros -rrb- .

at the warsaw school of economics , professor leszek balcerowicz put together a " shock therapy " plan to invigorate the country 's economy .
he 's now known as the father of poland 's market reforms , but looking back , he admits that the challenges facing the country two decades ago were daunting .
" poland was burdened by the troubles of communism - huge waste , inefficiency , declining production , " said balcerowicz .
" in addition , there was huge foreign debt incurred in the 1970s , and a runaway inflation of 50 percent a month .
it was an economic catastrophe . "
balcerowicz 's bitter pill was a strict monetarist approach , coupled with fast-paced market reforms , which quickly put poland 's house in order .
even though polish governments have changed frequently since then , balcerowicz is happy that politicians have consistently kept the country 's finances in check , and made the most of poland 's natural advantage : its size .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .

only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .
merkel herself has called nuclear power " an important bridge technology " on the way to cleaner and safer power for future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to see nuclear plants shut down nuclear power unpopular but vital nuclear power is highly unpopular in germany , with shipments of nuclear waste regularly triggering angry protests .
the country has no permanent storage site for the waste .
but germany is eager to reduce its dependence on volatile gas and oil imports from russia or the middle east and with only limited domestic resources , nuclear power is a strategically important energy source .
the new government plans , however , are vague , says fdp energy expert gudrun kopp , with details on which reactors will remain on line to be determined at a later date .
german media also report that merkel wants to delay concrete decisions on the nuclear issue until after a key state election in north rhine-westphalia next may , which could lose her party a majority in the upper house of parliament .
business and industry are very much in favor of the move , but environmentalists have vowed street protests , if merkel and the fdp go ahead with their plans. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 15.10.2009 europe 's top teams dominate list of world cup contenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's top teams will be among those to beat in 2010 with qualification secured , europe 's top teams are looking towards next summer 's world cup in south africa with some confidence .
deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .

deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .

however , turkey is still a long way from meeting the eu 's criteria for entry . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats agreed " unanimously " to stick with the last government 's position on turkey 's eu membership bid , sources from both parties told afp on thursday .
the previous coalition of the christian democrats with the center-left social democrats had called the negotiations an " open-ended process " with no guarantee of membership .
the deal between the parties is expected be worded in a similar fashion to merkel 's 2005 coalition agreement .
in that document , the parties said " if the eu is not in a position to take on new members or turkey can not fully meet all the criteria necessary for membership , turkey must be bound closely to european structures in a way that allows its privileged relationship with the eu to develop further . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozyand merkel oppose eu membership for turkey many had speculated prior to the talks that the new government would outline a tougher stance against turkey 's eu membership bid , since merkel 's conservatives are strongly opposed to it .
they prefer a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead .
turkey 's disputed eu bid the free democrats , on the other hand , is not against turkey 's membership in principle , but says there are " major deficits " in turkey 's efforts to meet eu criteria for entry .
the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle - who is widely expected to become germany 's new foreign minister - is open to membership , but says turkey first needs to resolve its ongoing dispute with eu-member cyprus and improve rights for the country 's kurds .
turkey has also been criticized for not making sufficient progress in improving its human rights record and reforming the judiciary .
the news of the coalition 's compromise on turkey comes one day after the european commission released its annual progress report on turkey 's bid to join the eu , which gave a mixed review .
whether or not to allow turkey accession into the eu has been a contentious issue in germany - and across europe - since official talks were opened in 2005 .
even those hopeful that turkey will eventually gain entry acknowledge that it could take decades. vj / afp / reuters / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they prefer a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead .
turkey 's disputed eu bid the free democrats , on the other hand , is not against turkey 's membership in principle , but says there are " major deficits " in turkey 's efforts to meet eu criteria for entry .
the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle - who is widely expected to become germany 's new foreign minister - is open to membership , but says turkey first needs to resolve its ongoing dispute with eu-member cyprus and improve rights for the country 's kurds .
turkey has also been criticized for not making sufficient progress in improving its human rights record and reforming the judiciary .
the news of the coalition 's compromise on turkey comes one day after the european commission released its annual progress report on turkey 's bid to join the eu , which gave a mixed review .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.10.2009 row continues over protestant church memo attacking catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paper attacks pope benedict xvi as incompetent a memorandum by a senior german protestant clergyman heavily criticizing the pope and the catholic church in germany has thrown interfaith relations between the two denominations in the country into turmoil . the paper describes catholic pope benedict xvi as incompetent and unwilling to promote interfaith dialog between protestants and catholics .
it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?
if the answers to all these turn out to be ' yes ' , then maybe … just maybe … author : nick amies editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .
merkel herself has called nuclear power " an important bridge technology " on the way to cleaner and safer power for future generations .

the country has no permanent storage site for the waste .
but germany is eager to reduce its dependence on volatile gas and oil imports from russia or the middle east and with only limited domestic resources , nuclear power is a strategically important energy source .
the new government plans , however , are vague , says fdp energy expert gudrun kopp , with details on which reactors will remain on line to be determined at a later date .
german media also report that merkel wants to delay concrete decisions on the nuclear issue until after a key state election in north rhine-westphalia next may , which could lose her party a majority in the upper house of parliament .
business and industry are very much in favor of the move , but environmentalists have vowed street protests , if merkel and the fdp go ahead with their plans. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.10.2009 row continues over protestant church memo attacking catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paper attacks pope benedict xvi as incompetent a memorandum by a senior german protestant clergyman heavily criticizing the pope and the catholic church in germany has thrown interfaith relations between the two denominations in the country into turmoil . the paper describes catholic pope benedict xvi as incompetent and unwilling to promote interfaith dialog between protestants and catholics .
it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?

the solar industry , however , is warning against taking drastic steps . in coalition talks , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have discussed drastically slashing renewable energy subsidies as the industry becomes more efficient .
" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .
this is a schedule both the economic and the environmental committees of the upcoming coalition could agree on . costs for solar plants have dropped according to holger krawinkel , an energy expert at the federation of german consumer organizations , cuts are necessary for compensation for selling solar power back to the public grid . " if costs for solar plants drop by 30 percent , then it 's not quite logical why the compensation should n't be proportionately reduced , " he said .
" our demands have been met : the plants have gotten cheaper ; the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- planned a reduction anyway . " carsten koernig , executive director of the german solar industry association , said subsidies to the industry are cut by 10 percent each year as it is .
this was appropriate , considering that the industry had been able to cut its costs by 50 percent since 2000 , he added . " now the question is : are there even bigger margins ?
we warn against large-scale changes , " said koernig , who conceded that the new government may want to assess the need for change , considering the recent cost cuts . large-scale reductions , however , could have a negative impact on customers ' willingness to make the initial investment in solar panels , should the compensation for selling back to the grid be slashed too drastrically . however , koernig said he suspects another motive : " we all know that -lsb- the german government -rsb- mainly want to implement longer runs for nuclear power facilities . " bildunterschrift : the solar industry has drastically reduced the cost of panels in recent years selling energy to the public grid solar energy customers who have installed solar cells at home and feed energy into the public grid are now getting paid a hefty 43 cents -lrb- $ 0.64 -rrb- per kilowatt hour as an incentive to purchase the initial solar set-up . the costs of subsidies is passed on to all electricity consumers , said koernig . " this leads to an increase of the electricity tariff by 0.5 percent , " he added .
in comparison , the energy wasted by leaving electronic devices in stand-by mode adds up to 10 percent of an average customer 's bill . some are claiming this amount is too high .
according to krawinkel , the subsidy should drop proportionally .
" do i need a return of 15 or 20 percent -lsb- for solar energy sold back to the grid -rsb- , or should n't three , four , five percent do the job of an incentive for this innovation ?

the solar industry , however , is warning against taking drastic steps . in coalition talks , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have discussed drastically slashing renewable energy subsidies as the industry becomes more efficient .
" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .
this is a schedule both the economic and the environmental committees of the upcoming coalition could agree on . costs for solar plants have dropped according to holger krawinkel , an energy expert at the federation of german consumer organizations , cuts are necessary for compensation for selling solar power back to the public grid . " if costs for solar plants drop by 30 percent , then it 's not quite logical why the compensation should n't be proportionately reduced , " he said .
" our demands have been met : the plants have gotten cheaper ; the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- planned a reduction anyway . " carsten koernig , executive director of the german solar industry association , said subsidies to the industry are cut by 10 percent each year as it is .
this was appropriate , considering that the industry had been able to cut its costs by 50 percent since 2000 , he added . " now the question is : are there even bigger margins ?
we warn against large-scale changes , " said koernig , who conceded that the new government may want to assess the need for change , considering the recent cost cuts . large-scale reductions , however , could have a negative impact on customers ' willingness to make the initial investment in solar panels , should the compensation for selling back to the grid be slashed too drastrically . however , koernig said he suspects another motive : " we all know that -lsb- the german government -rsb- mainly want to implement longer runs for nuclear power facilities . " bildunterschrift : the solar industry has drastically reduced the cost of panels in recent years selling energy to the public grid solar energy customers who have installed solar cells at home and feed energy into the public grid are now getting paid a hefty 43 cents -lrb- $ 0.64 -rrb- per kilowatt hour as an incentive to purchase the initial solar set-up . the costs of subsidies is passed on to all electricity consumers , said koernig . " this leads to an increase of the electricity tariff by 0.5 percent , " he added .
in comparison , the energy wasted by leaving electronic devices in stand-by mode adds up to 10 percent of an average customer 's bill . some are claiming this amount is too high .
according to krawinkel , the subsidy should drop proportionally .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.10.2009 row continues over protestant church memo attacking catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paper attacks pope benedict xvi as incompetent a memorandum by a senior german protestant clergyman heavily criticizing the pope and the catholic church in germany has thrown interfaith relations between the two denominations in the country into turmoil . the paper describes catholic pope benedict xvi as incompetent and unwilling to promote interfaith dialog between protestants and catholics .
it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .
the plant was used to produce fuel for nuclear power stations in france , which has the second largest network of nuclear facilities after the united states. dfm / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 15.10.2009 europe 's top teams dominate list of world cup contenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's top teams will be among those to beat in 2010 with qualification secured , europe 's top teams are looking towards next summer 's world cup in south africa with some confidence .
deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?
if the answers to all these turn out to be ' yes ' , then maybe … just maybe … author : nick amies editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "

iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .

his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .
romania 's troubled economy romania has gone through a sharp economic reversal in the past year , because of the global financial crisis and failed economic policies .
it turned from being the european union 's fastest-growing economy and an attractive target for foreign investors to a problem zone in desperate need of aid .
the imf , the world bank and the eu agreed to lend romania 20 billion euros in exchange for reforms , including an overhaul of its pension system and pledges to cut the public deficit , which is expected to top 7.3 percent of gross domestic product this year. bk / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .
the plant was used to produce fuel for nuclear power stations in france , which has the second largest network of nuclear facilities after the united states. dfm / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 15.10.2009 row continues over protestant church memo attacking catholic church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paper attacks pope benedict xvi as incompetent a memorandum by a senior german protestant clergyman heavily criticizing the pope and the catholic church in germany has thrown interfaith relations between the two denominations in the country into turmoil . the paper describes catholic pope benedict xvi as incompetent and unwilling to promote interfaith dialog between protestants and catholics .
it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .
romania 's troubled economy romania has gone through a sharp economic reversal in the past year , because of the global financial crisis and failed economic policies .
it turned from being the european union 's fastest-growing economy and an attractive target for foreign investors to a problem zone in desperate need of aid .
the imf , the world bank and the eu agreed to lend romania 20 billion euros in exchange for reforms , including an overhaul of its pension system and pledges to cut the public deficit , which is expected to top 7.3 percent of gross domestic product this year. bk / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the solar industry , however , is warning against taking drastic steps . in coalition talks , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have discussed drastically slashing renewable energy subsidies as the industry becomes more efficient .
" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .
this is a schedule both the economic and the environmental committees of the upcoming coalition could agree on . costs for solar plants have dropped according to holger krawinkel , an energy expert at the federation of german consumer organizations , cuts are necessary for compensation for selling solar power back to the public grid . " if costs for solar plants drop by 30 percent , then it 's not quite logical why the compensation should n't be proportionately reduced , " he said .
" our demands have been met : the plants have gotten cheaper ; the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- planned a reduction anyway . " carsten koernig , executive director of the german solar industry association , said subsidies to the industry are cut by 10 percent each year as it is .
this was appropriate , considering that the industry had been able to cut its costs by 50 percent since 2000 , he added . " now the question is : are there even bigger margins ?
we warn against large-scale changes , " said koernig , who conceded that the new government may want to assess the need for change , considering the recent cost cuts . large-scale reductions , however , could have a negative impact on customers ' willingness to make the initial investment in solar panels , should the compensation for selling back to the grid be slashed too drastrically . however , koernig said he suspects another motive : " we all know that -lsb- the german government -rsb- mainly want to implement longer runs for nuclear power facilities . " bildunterschrift : the solar industry has drastically reduced the cost of panels in recent years selling energy to the public grid solar energy customers who have installed solar cells at home and feed energy into the public grid are now getting paid a hefty 43 cents -lrb- $ 0.64 -rrb- per kilowatt hour as an incentive to purchase the initial solar set-up . the costs of subsidies is passed on to all electricity consumers , said koernig . " this leads to an increase of the electricity tariff by 0.5 percent , " he added .
in comparison , the energy wasted by leaving electronic devices in stand-by mode adds up to 10 percent of an average customer 's bill . some are claiming this amount is too high .
according to krawinkel , the subsidy should drop proportionally .

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

however , turkey is still a long way from meeting the eu 's criteria for entry . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats agreed " unanimously " to stick with the last government 's position on turkey 's eu membership bid , sources from both parties told afp on thursday .
the previous coalition of the christian democrats with the center-left social democrats had called the negotiations an " open-ended process " with no guarantee of membership .
the deal between the parties is expected be worded in a similar fashion to merkel 's 2005 coalition agreement .
in that document , the parties said " if the eu is not in a position to take on new members or turkey can not fully meet all the criteria necessary for membership , turkey must be bound closely to european structures in a way that allows its privileged relationship with the eu to develop further . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozyand merkel oppose eu membership for turkey many had speculated prior to the talks that the new government would outline a tougher stance against turkey 's eu membership bid , since merkel 's conservatives are strongly opposed to it .
they prefer a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead .
turkey 's disputed eu bid the free democrats , on the other hand , is not against turkey 's membership in principle , but says there are " major deficits " in turkey 's efforts to meet eu criteria for entry .
the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle - who is widely expected to become germany 's new foreign minister - is open to membership , but says turkey first needs to resolve its ongoing dispute with eu-member cyprus and improve rights for the country 's kurds .
turkey has also been criticized for not making sufficient progress in improving its human rights record and reforming the judiciary .
the news of the coalition 's compromise on turkey comes one day after the european commission released its annual progress report on turkey 's bid to join the eu , which gave a mixed review .
whether or not to allow turkey accession into the eu has been a contentious issue in germany - and across europe - since official talks were opened in 2005 .

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , turkey is still a long way from meeting the eu 's criteria for entry . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats agreed " unanimously " to stick with the last government 's position on turkey 's eu membership bid , sources from both parties told afp on thursday .
the previous coalition of the christian democrats with the center-left social democrats had called the negotiations an " open-ended process " with no guarantee of membership .
the deal between the parties is expected be worded in a similar fashion to merkel 's 2005 coalition agreement .
in that document , the parties said " if the eu is not in a position to take on new members or turkey can not fully meet all the criteria necessary for membership , turkey must be bound closely to european structures in a way that allows its privileged relationship with the eu to develop further . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozyand merkel oppose eu membership for turkey many had speculated prior to the talks that the new government would outline a tougher stance against turkey 's eu membership bid , since merkel 's conservatives are strongly opposed to it .
they prefer a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead .
turkey 's disputed eu bid the free democrats , on the other hand , is not against turkey 's membership in principle , but says there are " major deficits " in turkey 's efforts to meet eu criteria for entry .
the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle - who is widely expected to become germany 's new foreign minister - is open to membership , but says turkey first needs to resolve its ongoing dispute with eu-member cyprus and improve rights for the country 's kurds .
turkey has also been criticized for not making sufficient progress in improving its human rights record and reforming the judiciary .
the news of the coalition 's compromise on turkey comes one day after the european commission released its annual progress report on turkey 's bid to join the eu , which gave a mixed review .
whether or not to allow turkey accession into the eu has been a contentious issue in germany - and across europe - since official talks were opened in 2005 .
even those hopeful that turkey will eventually gain entry acknowledge that it could take decades. vj / afp / reuters / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .
the plant was used to produce fuel for nuclear power stations in france , which has the second largest network of nuclear facilities after the united states. dfm / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .
it consults on the basis of independent research findings in germany and worldwide and deals with current issues in cooperation between industrial and developing countries . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .
the plant was used to produce fuel for nuclear power stations in france , which has the second largest network of nuclear facilities after the united states. dfm / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ausgestrahlt " reported on wednesday that only 10 percent of that was returned to germany as enriched uranium .

uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .
about 10 to 15 percent of the material was treated and returned to germany .
urenco says it has meanwhile terminated cooperation with the russian company . government accused of " nuclear waste tourism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have protested against toxic waste shipments from germany following an inquiry by the left party , the government had already publicly acknowledged the exports in 2007 .
juergen maass , a spokesman for the environment ministry in berlin , on wednesday confirmed the shipments of depleted uranium to russia .
he emphasized that the shipments , although they did contain nuclear waste , were not illegal .
the federal office for radiation protection has said the exports were not subject to approval under the atomic energy act .
opposition parties have renewed criticism of the german government 's policy of exporting nuclear waste .
eva bulling-schroeter , environmental spokeswoman for the left party , called for an end to such shipments : " it is time the government stopped trivializing nuclear waste tourism . "
permanent storage of nuclear waste is not only an unsolved problem and a controversial issue in germany , as it does elsewhere in europe .
in france this week , an arte television documentary and the newspaper liberation said that more than 100 tons of depleted uranium from french power plants have been stored in an open-air complex in siberia .
furthermore , according to an italian environmental organization , at least two dozen ships containing radioactive waste have been sunk in the ionion sea off southern italy in order to bypass local laws. db / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 15.10.2009 europe 's top teams dominate list of world cup contenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's top teams will be among those to beat in 2010 with qualification secured , europe 's top teams are looking towards next summer 's world cup in south africa with some confidence .
deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?
if the answers to all these turn out to be ' yes ' , then maybe … just maybe … author : nick amies editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ausgestrahlt " reported on wednesday that only 10 percent of that was returned to germany as enriched uranium .
the anti-nuclear activists said the remaining 90 percent was stored in siberia , outdoors and in rusting containers .
uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .
about 10 to 15 percent of the material was treated and returned to germany .
urenco says it has meanwhile terminated cooperation with the russian company . government accused of " nuclear waste tourism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have protested against toxic waste shipments from germany following an inquiry by the left party , the government had already publicly acknowledged the exports in 2007 .
juergen maass , a spokesman for the environment ministry in berlin , on wednesday confirmed the shipments of depleted uranium to russia .
he emphasized that the shipments , although they did contain nuclear waste , were not illegal .
the federal office for radiation protection has said the exports were not subject to approval under the atomic energy act .
opposition parties have renewed criticism of the german government 's policy of exporting nuclear waste .
eva bulling-schroeter , environmental spokeswoman for the left party , called for an end to such shipments : " it is time the government stopped trivializing nuclear waste tourism . "
permanent storage of nuclear waste is not only an unsolved problem and a controversial issue in germany , as it does elsewhere in europe .
in france this week , an arte television documentary and the newspaper liberation said that more than 100 tons of depleted uranium from french power plants have been stored in an open-air complex in siberia .
furthermore , according to an italian environmental organization , at least two dozen ships containing radioactive waste have been sunk in the ionion sea off southern italy in order to bypass local laws. db / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 15.10.2009 europe 's top teams dominate list of world cup contenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's top teams will be among those to beat in 2010 with qualification secured , europe 's top teams are looking towards next summer 's world cup in south africa with some confidence .
deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?

deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?

" ausgestrahlt " reported on wednesday that only 10 percent of that was returned to germany as enriched uranium .
the anti-nuclear activists said the remaining 90 percent was stored in siberia , outdoors and in rusting containers .
uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .
about 10 to 15 percent of the material was treated and returned to germany .
urenco says it has meanwhile terminated cooperation with the russian company . government accused of " nuclear waste tourism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have protested against toxic waste shipments from germany following an inquiry by the left party , the government had already publicly acknowledged the exports in 2007 .
juergen maass , a spokesman for the environment ministry in berlin , on wednesday confirmed the shipments of depleted uranium to russia .
he emphasized that the shipments , although they did contain nuclear waste , were not illegal .
the federal office for radiation protection has said the exports were not subject to approval under the atomic energy act .
opposition parties have renewed criticism of the german government 's policy of exporting nuclear waste .
eva bulling-schroeter , environmental spokeswoman for the left party , called for an end to such shipments : " it is time the government stopped trivializing nuclear waste tourism . "
permanent storage of nuclear waste is not only an unsolved problem and a controversial issue in germany , as it does elsewhere in europe .
in france this week , an arte television documentary and the newspaper liberation said that more than 100 tons of depleted uranium from french power plants have been stored in an open-air complex in siberia .
furthermore , according to an italian environmental organization , at least two dozen ships containing radioactive waste have been sunk in the ionion sea off southern italy in order to bypass local laws. db / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 15.10.2009 europe 's top teams dominate list of world cup contenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's top teams will be among those to beat in 2010 with qualification secured , europe 's top teams are looking towards next summer 's world cup in south africa with some confidence .
deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?
if the answers to all these turn out to be ' yes ' , then maybe … just maybe … author : nick amies editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the solar industry , however , is warning against taking drastic steps . in coalition talks , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have discussed drastically slashing renewable energy subsidies as the industry becomes more efficient .
" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .
this is a schedule both the economic and the environmental committees of the upcoming coalition could agree on . costs for solar plants have dropped according to holger krawinkel , an energy expert at the federation of german consumer organizations , cuts are necessary for compensation for selling solar power back to the public grid . " if costs for solar plants drop by 30 percent , then it 's not quite logical why the compensation should n't be proportionately reduced , " he said .
" our demands have been met : the plants have gotten cheaper ; the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- planned a reduction anyway . " carsten koernig , executive director of the german solar industry association , said subsidies to the industry are cut by 10 percent each year as it is .
this was appropriate , considering that the industry had been able to cut its costs by 50 percent since 2000 , he added . " now the question is : are there even bigger margins ?
we warn against large-scale changes , " said koernig , who conceded that the new government may want to assess the need for change , considering the recent cost cuts . large-scale reductions , however , could have a negative impact on customers ' willingness to make the initial investment in solar panels , should the compensation for selling back to the grid be slashed too drastrically . however , koernig said he suspects another motive : " we all know that -lsb- the german government -rsb- mainly want to implement longer runs for nuclear power facilities . " bildunterschrift : the solar industry has drastically reduced the cost of panels in recent years selling energy to the public grid solar energy customers who have installed solar cells at home and feed energy into the public grid are now getting paid a hefty 43 cents -lrb- $ 0.64 -rrb- per kilowatt hour as an incentive to purchase the initial solar set-up . the costs of subsidies is passed on to all electricity consumers , said koernig . " this leads to an increase of the electricity tariff by 0.5 percent , " he added .
in comparison , the energy wasted by leaving electronic devices in stand-by mode adds up to 10 percent of an average customer 's bill . some are claiming this amount is too high .
according to krawinkel , the subsidy should drop proportionally .

" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .
merkel herself has called nuclear power " an important bridge technology " on the way to cleaner and safer power for future generations .

the new government plans , however , are vague , says fdp energy expert gudrun kopp , with details on which reactors will remain on line to be determined at a later date .
german media also report that merkel wants to delay concrete decisions on the nuclear issue until after a key state election in north rhine-westphalia next may , which could lose her party a majority in the upper house of parliament .

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .
the oecd 's findings on the educational circumstances of immigrants in germany were similar to those of pisa studies. bk / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .

" this case is technically and factually baseless , " said werner schmidt , who was the bank 's chief executive two years ago when the bavarian bank acquired the austrian unit hypo group alpe-adria -lrb- hgaa -rrb- .
bayernlb is the second-biggest regional bank in germany .
it paid 1.6 billion euros for 67percent of hgaa 's shares in may 2007 .
german prosecutors claim schmidt , who left the bank in 2008 , knowingly paid too much for the deal .
criticism from state representative in support of schmidt , then-bavarian finance minister kurt faltlhauser told the german newspaper sueddetusche zeitung that he considered the deal to be fair even today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state prosecutors say bayernlb paid too much when it acquired austrian bank hgaa but eike hallitzky , a green party member of the bavarian state parliament , said schmidt may have personally profited from the deal .
hallitzky also claimed on german radio that schmidt and hgaa funds manager and majority shareholder tilo berlin had been friends , and that if berlin 's promotion to ceo of the new subsidiary had anything to do with their friendship , it would be scandalous .
schmidt is currently the only suspect in the investigation according to prosecutors , who also searched his private residence and hgaa offices in austria on wednesday .
bayernlb lost 5.2 billion euros last year , and while it received a 10 billion euro bailout from the bavarian government , it still may not have balanced all its debts for 2009 .
its hgaa subsidiary has also been struggling with the economic crisis , receiving upwards of 700 million euros from the austrian government in 2008 . acb / ap / reuters editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair literature -pipe- 15.10.2009 bookworms are rare in the land of goethe and schiller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some never pick up a book ; others fly through one a week germans are known around the world for being cultured , but not everyone in the country is necessarily a reader .
a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , turkey is still a long way from meeting the eu 's criteria for entry . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats agreed " unanimously " to stick with the last government 's position on turkey 's eu membership bid , sources from both parties told afp on thursday .

they prefer a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead .
turkey 's disputed eu bid the free democrats , on the other hand , is not against turkey 's membership in principle , but says there are " major deficits " in turkey 's efforts to meet eu criteria for entry .
the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle - who is widely expected to become germany 's new foreign minister - is open to membership , but says turkey first needs to resolve its ongoing dispute with eu-member cyprus and improve rights for the country 's kurds .
turkey has also been criticized for not making sufficient progress in improving its human rights record and reforming the judiciary .
the news of the coalition 's compromise on turkey comes one day after the european commission released its annual progress report on turkey 's bid to join the eu , which gave a mixed review .
whether or not to allow turkey accession into the eu has been a contentious issue in germany - and across europe - since official talks were opened in 2005 .

some say he likely never will . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency i am a us citizen , loyal to my country .
president obama is a talker .
he issues grand visions from his mouth .
in contrast , george bush said little , evoked no praise , but did more to confront the real enemies of peace than has been done by president obama .
the world looks at this talker as a visionary .
i think the world is deceived .
the award of this prize so early cheapens it and is yet another mistake of the committee as was the choice of arafat , gore , and the others nominated in the past . - randolph a. latall , us given that obama has done absolutely nothing to merit the award of any peace prize , never mind the nobel peace prize , simply goes to demonstrate how little value this prize now has beyond the 1.4 million euros to the recipient . it has more to do with adding cachet to the nobel prize via celebrity .
if obama had the slightest moral virtue , he would decline this prize . - charles smyth , great britain i think that he has shown good intentions and improved the atmosphere for peace .
he has only been in office for nine months .
significant actions that he has accomplished were cancelling the missile defense shield , laying the ground work for iran nuclear disarmament and solving the georgia issue with russia .
intentions have been substituted for results . - john reeder , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama won for " efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation " how can anybody be worthy of the nobel peace prize by just laying out a plan but has no hope of ever achieving much of the plan in reality ?
many people realize obama is not any more effective than the former bush administration .
by expanding military operations in afghanistan , he is still listening to diverse lobby groups in washington that advised g. w. bush on a stalled foreign policy ; from the road to peace in the middle east , to nuclear disarmament of countries who should have never been allowed by the un to acquire these weapons of mass destruction . - g. gosau , canada the nobel committee has recognized that president barack obama has set the stage for a worldwide era of enlightenment and peace .
in the 18th century , there was a philosophical wind that swept through the western world . the enlightenment espoused the principles of human dignity , freedom , and government by the people that are prominent in the texts of the declaration of independence and our us constitution .
today we are experiencing the birth of a second " age of enlightenment " which will effect not only western culture but have world-wide influence ; shaping human history for years in the future .
we are no longer satisfied with following leaders that tell us to stop thinking for ourselves but follow their direction on faith .
we are invigorated with dialogue on nuclear disarmament , reconsidering the death penalty , renewable energy , international cooperation , social justice , environmental concerns , education , human rights , universal health care , sex education , religious tolerance , diplomacy and the true implications of the rule of law .
like any change , there is resistance .
new social programs are called communist or socialist to distract the people from real purpose .
investments in our future are bashed as too expensive .
we ca n't let this opportunity slip away , and it will , if we do n't support it in our everyday lives by communicating with our leaders and discussing it with our friends .
it is time for americans to set aside our differences and unite for the common good of all .
president obama has presented us all with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and for that he deserves the nobel prize . - joseph suste , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader thinks chinese president hu jintao was more deserving of the prize it 's official , the international community has lost its collective mind .
obama ?
peace prize ?
what , during his lifetime , has he done to serve the world in the pursuit of peace ?
nothing .
clearly the nobel peace prize should be renamed the " worlds most popular person prize . " frankly , i 'm disgusted . - thor hougen , us i think he deserves it .
he is the first african-american president who gives a hope for all peoples of the world .
here in israel there is anti-obama propaganda , even from the chairman of the israeli parliament .
it is clear that the israeli public was anti-obama during the 2008 us election , it was not his ideology but his skin color . - mequanint birhanu , israel it is quite a recognition for just few months in the oval office .
personally , i like the choice but people who live in former soviet republics are feeling the chilling wind from the east .
without the security blanket of the missile shield , it is going to be cold .
i had president hu jintao as my favorite .
hu has done miracles with putin 's administration .
he made him trade rather than wage war .
hu maintained china 's one child policy risking demographic imbalance at home but globally it was a sound move .
hu is also instrumental at keeping peace in asia pacific region .
he builds roads , railroad , schools and hospitals for africans , instead of filling african corrupt government 's officials pockets with money .
hu is only allowing his people to repossess outer mongolia by peaceful migration .
i hope hu will receive the nobel peace price next year . - paul heinila , canada send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency us president barack obama has won the nobel peace prize .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says the award is premature considering that obama has yet to act on his words to solve global conflicts .
-lrb- 09.10.2009 -rrb- obama accepts nobel peace prize as " call to action " us president barack obama said on friday he was " surprised and humbled " at winning the 2009 nobel peace prize and said he accepted the award as a call to action for nations to confront the challenges of the 21st century .

this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency i am a us citizen , loyal to my country .
president obama is a talker .
he issues grand visions from his mouth .
in contrast , george bush said little , evoked no praise , but did more to confront the real enemies of peace than has been done by president obama .
the world looks at this talker as a visionary .
i think the world is deceived .

if obama had the slightest moral virtue , he would decline this prize . - charles smyth , great britain i think that he has shown good intentions and improved the atmosphere for peace .
he has only been in office for nine months .
significant actions that he has accomplished were cancelling the missile defense shield , laying the ground work for iran nuclear disarmament and solving the georgia issue with russia .
intentions have been substituted for results . - john reeder , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama won for " efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation " how can anybody be worthy of the nobel peace prize by just laying out a plan but has no hope of ever achieving much of the plan in reality ?
many people realize obama is not any more effective than the former bush administration .
by expanding military operations in afghanistan , he is still listening to diverse lobby groups in washington that advised g. w. bush on a stalled foreign policy ; from the road to peace in the middle east , to nuclear disarmament of countries who should have never been allowed by the un to acquire these weapons of mass destruction . - g. gosau , canada the nobel committee has recognized that president barack obama has set the stage for a worldwide era of enlightenment and peace .
in the 18th century , there was a philosophical wind that swept through the western world . the enlightenment espoused the principles of human dignity , freedom , and government by the people that are prominent in the texts of the declaration of independence and our us constitution .
today we are experiencing the birth of a second " age of enlightenment " which will effect not only western culture but have world-wide influence ; shaping human history for years in the future .
we are no longer satisfied with following leaders that tell us to stop thinking for ourselves but follow their direction on faith .
we are invigorated with dialogue on nuclear disarmament , reconsidering the death penalty , renewable energy , international cooperation , social justice , environmental concerns , education , human rights , universal health care , sex education , religious tolerance , diplomacy and the true implications of the rule of law .
like any change , there is resistance .

obama ?
peace prize ?
what , during his lifetime , has he done to serve the world in the pursuit of peace ?
nothing .
clearly the nobel peace prize should be renamed the " worlds most popular person prize . " frankly , i 'm disgusted . - thor hougen , us i think he deserves it .
he is the first african-american president who gives a hope for all peoples of the world .
here in israel there is anti-obama propaganda , even from the chairman of the israeli parliament .
it is clear that the israeli public was anti-obama during the 2008 us election , it was not his ideology but his skin color . - mequanint birhanu , israel it is quite a recognition for just few months in the oval office .
personally , i like the choice but people who live in former soviet republics are feeling the chilling wind from the east .
without the security blanket of the missile shield , it is going to be cold .

hu has done miracles with putin 's administration .
he made him trade rather than wage war .
hu maintained china 's one child policy risking demographic imbalance at home but globally it was a sound move .
hu is also instrumental at keeping peace in asia pacific region .
he builds roads , railroad , schools and hospitals for africans , instead of filling african corrupt government 's officials pockets with money .

he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .
romania 's troubled economy romania has gone through a sharp economic reversal in the past year , because of the global financial crisis and failed economic policies .
it turned from being the european union 's fastest-growing economy and an attractive target for foreign investors to a problem zone in desperate need of aid .
the imf , the world bank and the eu agreed to lend romania 20 billion euros in exchange for reforms , including an overhaul of its pension system and pledges to cut the public deficit , which is expected to top 7.3 percent of gross domestic product this year. bk / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

turkey has also been criticized for not making sufficient progress in improving its human rights record and reforming the judiciary .
the news of the coalition 's compromise on turkey comes one day after the european commission released its annual progress report on turkey 's bid to join the eu , which gave a mixed review .
whether or not to allow turkey accession into the eu has been a contentious issue in germany - and across europe - since official talks were opened in 2005 .
even those hopeful that turkey will eventually gain entry acknowledge that it could take decades. vj / afp / reuters / kna editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the solar industry , however , is warning against taking drastic steps . in coalition talks , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have discussed drastically slashing renewable energy subsidies as the industry becomes more efficient .
" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .

" this case is technically and factually baseless , " said werner schmidt , who was the bank 's chief executive two years ago when the bavarian bank acquired the austrian unit hypo group alpe-adria -lrb- hgaa -rrb- .
bayernlb is the second-biggest regional bank in germany .
it paid 1.6 billion euros for 67percent of hgaa 's shares in may 2007 .
german prosecutors claim schmidt , who left the bank in 2008 , knowingly paid too much for the deal .
criticism from state representative in support of schmidt , then-bavarian finance minister kurt faltlhauser told the german newspaper sueddetusche zeitung that he considered the deal to be fair even today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state prosecutors say bayernlb paid too much when it acquired austrian bank hgaa but eike hallitzky , a green party member of the bavarian state parliament , said schmidt may have personally profited from the deal .
hallitzky also claimed on german radio that schmidt and hgaa funds manager and majority shareholder tilo berlin had been friends , and that if berlin 's promotion to ceo of the new subsidiary had anything to do with their friendship , it would be scandalous .
schmidt is currently the only suspect in the investigation according to prosecutors , who also searched his private residence and hgaa offices in austria on wednesday .
bayernlb lost 5.2 billion euros last year , and while it received a 10 billion euro bailout from the bavarian government , it still may not have balanced all its debts for 2009 .
its hgaa subsidiary has also been struggling with the economic crisis , receiving upwards of 700 million euros from the austrian government in 2008 . acb / ap / reuters editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .
romania 's troubled economy romania has gone through a sharp economic reversal in the past year , because of the global financial crisis and failed economic policies .
it turned from being the european union 's fastest-growing economy and an attractive target for foreign investors to a problem zone in desperate need of aid .

he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "

iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .

nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency i am a us citizen , loyal to my country .
president obama is a talker .
he issues grand visions from his mouth .
in contrast , george bush said little , evoked no praise , but did more to confront the real enemies of peace than has been done by president obama .
the world looks at this talker as a visionary .
i think the world is deceived .
the award of this prize so early cheapens it and is yet another mistake of the committee as was the choice of arafat , gore , and the others nominated in the past . - randolph a. latall , us given that obama has done absolutely nothing to merit the award of any peace prize , never mind the nobel peace prize , simply goes to demonstrate how little value this prize now has beyond the 1.4 million euros to the recipient . it has more to do with adding cachet to the nobel prize via celebrity .
if obama had the slightest moral virtue , he would decline this prize . - charles smyth , great britain i think that he has shown good intentions and improved the atmosphere for peace .
he has only been in office for nine months .
significant actions that he has accomplished were cancelling the missile defense shield , laying the ground work for iran nuclear disarmament and solving the georgia issue with russia .
intentions have been substituted for results . - john reeder , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama won for " efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation " how can anybody be worthy of the nobel peace prize by just laying out a plan but has no hope of ever achieving much of the plan in reality ?
many people realize obama is not any more effective than the former bush administration .
by expanding military operations in afghanistan , he is still listening to diverse lobby groups in washington that advised g. w. bush on a stalled foreign policy ; from the road to peace in the middle east , to nuclear disarmament of countries who should have never been allowed by the un to acquire these weapons of mass destruction . - g. gosau , canada the nobel committee has recognized that president barack obama has set the stage for a worldwide era of enlightenment and peace .
in the 18th century , there was a philosophical wind that swept through the western world . the enlightenment espoused the principles of human dignity , freedom , and government by the people that are prominent in the texts of the declaration of independence and our us constitution .
today we are experiencing the birth of a second " age of enlightenment " which will effect not only western culture but have world-wide influence ; shaping human history for years in the future .
we are no longer satisfied with following leaders that tell us to stop thinking for ourselves but follow their direction on faith .
we are invigorated with dialogue on nuclear disarmament , reconsidering the death penalty , renewable energy , international cooperation , social justice , environmental concerns , education , human rights , universal health care , sex education , religious tolerance , diplomacy and the true implications of the rule of law .
like any change , there is resistance .
new social programs are called communist or socialist to distract the people from real purpose .
investments in our future are bashed as too expensive .
we ca n't let this opportunity slip away , and it will , if we do n't support it in our everyday lives by communicating with our leaders and discussing it with our friends .
it is time for americans to set aside our differences and unite for the common good of all .
president obama has presented us all with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and for that he deserves the nobel prize . - joseph suste , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader thinks chinese president hu jintao was more deserving of the prize it 's official , the international community has lost its collective mind .
obama ?
peace prize ?
what , during his lifetime , has he done to serve the world in the pursuit of peace ?
nothing .
clearly the nobel peace prize should be renamed the " worlds most popular person prize . " frankly , i 'm disgusted . - thor hougen , us i think he deserves it .
he is the first african-american president who gives a hope for all peoples of the world .
here in israel there is anti-obama propaganda , even from the chairman of the israeli parliament .
it is clear that the israeli public was anti-obama during the 2008 us election , it was not his ideology but his skin color . - mequanint birhanu , israel it is quite a recognition for just few months in the oval office .
personally , i like the choice but people who live in former soviet republics are feeling the chilling wind from the east .
without the security blanket of the missile shield , it is going to be cold .
i had president hu jintao as my favorite .
hu has done miracles with putin 's administration .
he made him trade rather than wage war .
hu maintained china 's one child policy risking demographic imbalance at home but globally it was a sound move .
hu is also instrumental at keeping peace in asia pacific region .
he builds roads , railroad , schools and hospitals for africans , instead of filling african corrupt government 's officials pockets with money .
hu is only allowing his people to repossess outer mongolia by peaceful migration .
i hope hu will receive the nobel peace price next year . - paul heinila , canada send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency us president barack obama has won the nobel peace prize .

the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .
romania 's troubled economy romania has gone through a sharp economic reversal in the past year , because of the global financial crisis and failed economic policies .
it turned from being the european union 's fastest-growing economy and an attractive target for foreign investors to a problem zone in desperate need of aid .
the imf , the world bank and the eu agreed to lend romania 20 billion euros in exchange for reforms , including an overhaul of its pension system and pledges to cut the public deficit , which is expected to top 7.3 percent of gross domestic product this year. bk / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

the controversial block on child porn websites will be lifted and new rules will affect police powers .
there are new breakthroughs in the ongoing coalition negotiations in the new german government ahead of decisive talks scheduled this weekend .
negotiators for both parties announced agreements in the areas of internal security that suggested that the fdp 's libertarian agenda is forcing concessions from the conservative cdu .
on the question of website blocks , an initiative introduced by cdu family minister ursula van der leyen earlier this year to combat child pornography , the two parties agreed to try to delete rather than block offending websites .
in a year 's time , the success of the deletion policy will be assessed .
police powers curbed important agreements are designed to curtail police powers : cdu interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced that the use of stored private data in police investigations would be limited to extremely dangerous situations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn sites are to be deleted rather than blocked the police will also have to apply to the federal public prosecutor to conduct secret online searches of computers , rather than local district courts .
the power to conduct online searches will not be extended to other security authorities like the secret service .
the free liberals could also record some success in the question of the protection of professional secrets .
under the new government agenda , all lawyers , not only criminal defense lawyers , will be allowed to withhold sensitive information from the police on professional grounds .
an official enquiry will be initiated to decide whether a similar rule can cover journalists .
prison sentences extended in addition , the two parties agreed that the maximum prison sentence for murder in the case of young criminals would be extended from 10 to 15 years .
a so-called " warning-shot-detention " of up to four weeks will also be introduced for young criminals placed on probation .
fdp domestic policy spokesman max stadler declared that he had expected the cdu bow to the fdp 's demands on certain issues .
" after all , we were elected to bring in changes and improvements , " he told reporters. bk / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .

" ausgestrahlt " reported on wednesday that only 10 percent of that was returned to germany as enriched uranium .
the anti-nuclear activists said the remaining 90 percent was stored in siberia , outdoors and in rusting containers .
uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .
about 10 to 15 percent of the material was treated and returned to germany .

he emphasized that the shipments , although they did contain nuclear waste , were not illegal .

opposition parties have renewed criticism of the german government 's policy of exporting nuclear waste .
eva bulling-schroeter , environmental spokeswoman for the left party , called for an end to such shipments : " it is time the government stopped trivializing nuclear waste tourism . "
permanent storage of nuclear waste is not only an unsolved problem and a controversial issue in germany , as it does elsewhere in europe .
in france this week , an arte television documentary and the newspaper liberation said that more than 100 tons of depleted uranium from french power plants have been stored in an open-air complex in siberia .

" ausgestrahlt " reported on wednesday that only 10 percent of that was returned to germany as enriched uranium .
the anti-nuclear activists said the remaining 90 percent was stored in siberia , outdoors and in rusting containers .
uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .
about 10 to 15 percent of the material was treated and returned to germany .
urenco says it has meanwhile terminated cooperation with the russian company . government accused of " nuclear waste tourism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have protested against toxic waste shipments from germany following an inquiry by the left party , the government had already publicly acknowledged the exports in 2007 .
juergen maass , a spokesman for the environment ministry in berlin , on wednesday confirmed the shipments of depleted uranium to russia .
he emphasized that the shipments , although they did contain nuclear waste , were not illegal .
the federal office for radiation protection has said the exports were not subject to approval under the atomic energy act .
opposition parties have renewed criticism of the german government 's policy of exporting nuclear waste .
eva bulling-schroeter , environmental spokeswoman for the left party , called for an end to such shipments : " it is time the government stopped trivializing nuclear waste tourism . "
permanent storage of nuclear waste is not only an unsolved problem and a controversial issue in germany , as it does elsewhere in europe .
in france this week , an arte television documentary and the newspaper liberation said that more than 100 tons of depleted uranium from french power plants have been stored in an open-air complex in siberia .
furthermore , according to an italian environmental organization , at least two dozen ships containing radioactive waste have been sunk in the ionion sea off southern italy in order to bypass local laws. db / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .
the plant was used to produce fuel for nuclear power stations in france , which has the second largest network of nuclear facilities after the united states. dfm / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 15.10.2009 crisis-ridden romania gets finance whizz as prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president basescu nominated a new prime minister thursday romanian president traian basescu nominated central bank adviser and former imf representative lucian croitoru as prime minister on thursday , following a collapse of the government earlier this week in parliament . following the collapse of emil boc 's centre-right government in a no-confidence vote , economics expert lucian croitoru became romania 's new prime minister on thursday .
he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .
romania 's troubled economy romania has gone through a sharp economic reversal in the past year , because of the global financial crisis and failed economic policies .
it turned from being the european union 's fastest-growing economy and an attractive target for foreign investors to a problem zone in desperate need of aid .
the imf , the world bank and the eu agreed to lend romania 20 billion euros in exchange for reforms , including an overhaul of its pension system and pledges to cut the public deficit , which is expected to top 7.3 percent of gross domestic product this year. bk / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 15.10.2009 europe 's top teams dominate list of world cup contenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's top teams will be among those to beat in 2010 with qualification secured , europe 's top teams are looking towards next summer 's world cup in south africa with some confidence .
deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?

deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 15.10.2009 europe 's top teams dominate list of world cup contenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's top teams will be among those to beat in 2010 with qualification secured , europe 's top teams are looking towards next summer 's world cup in south africa with some confidence .
deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?

the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?

this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .

they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

" this case is technically and factually baseless , " said werner schmidt , who was the bank 's chief executive two years ago when the bavarian bank acquired the austrian unit hypo group alpe-adria -lrb- hgaa -rrb- .
bayernlb is the second-biggest regional bank in germany .
it paid 1.6 billion euros for 67percent of hgaa 's shares in may 2007 .
german prosecutors claim schmidt , who left the bank in 2008 , knowingly paid too much for the deal .
criticism from state representative in support of schmidt , then-bavarian finance minister kurt faltlhauser told the german newspaper sueddetusche zeitung that he considered the deal to be fair even today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state prosecutors say bayernlb paid too much when it acquired austrian bank hgaa but eike hallitzky , a green party member of the bavarian state parliament , said schmidt may have personally profited from the deal .
hallitzky also claimed on german radio that schmidt and hgaa funds manager and majority shareholder tilo berlin had been friends , and that if berlin 's promotion to ceo of the new subsidiary had anything to do with their friendship , it would be scandalous .
schmidt is currently the only suspect in the investigation according to prosecutors , who also searched his private residence and hgaa offices in austria on wednesday .
bayernlb lost 5.2 billion euros last year , and while it received a 10 billion euro bailout from the bavarian government , it still may not have balanced all its debts for 2009 .
its hgaa subsidiary has also been struggling with the economic crisis , receiving upwards of 700 million euros from the austrian government in 2008 . acb / ap / reuters editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .
the oecd 's findings on the educational circumstances of immigrants in germany were similar to those of pisa studies. bk / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , turkey is still a long way from meeting the eu 's criteria for entry . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats agreed " unanimously " to stick with the last government 's position on turkey 's eu membership bid , sources from both parties told afp on thursday .
the previous coalition of the christian democrats with the center-left social democrats had called the negotiations an " open-ended process " with no guarantee of membership .
the deal between the parties is expected be worded in a similar fashion to merkel 's 2005 coalition agreement .
in that document , the parties said " if the eu is not in a position to take on new members or turkey can not fully meet all the criteria necessary for membership , turkey must be bound closely to european structures in a way that allows its privileged relationship with the eu to develop further . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozyand merkel oppose eu membership for turkey many had speculated prior to the talks that the new government would outline a tougher stance against turkey 's eu membership bid , since merkel 's conservatives are strongly opposed to it .
they prefer a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead .
turkey 's disputed eu bid the free democrats , on the other hand , is not against turkey 's membership in principle , but says there are " major deficits " in turkey 's efforts to meet eu criteria for entry .
the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle - who is widely expected to become germany 's new foreign minister - is open to membership , but says turkey first needs to resolve its ongoing dispute with eu-member cyprus and improve rights for the country 's kurds .
turkey has also been criticized for not making sufficient progress in improving its human rights record and reforming the judiciary .
the news of the coalition 's compromise on turkey comes one day after the european commission released its annual progress report on turkey 's bid to join the eu , which gave a mixed review .
whether or not to allow turkey accession into the eu has been a contentious issue in germany - and across europe - since official talks were opened in 2005 .

" this case is technically and factually baseless , " said werner schmidt , who was the bank 's chief executive two years ago when the bavarian bank acquired the austrian unit hypo group alpe-adria -lrb- hgaa -rrb- .
bayernlb is the second-biggest regional bank in germany .
it paid 1.6 billion euros for 67percent of hgaa 's shares in may 2007 .
german prosecutors claim schmidt , who left the bank in 2008 , knowingly paid too much for the deal .
criticism from state representative in support of schmidt , then-bavarian finance minister kurt faltlhauser told the german newspaper sueddetusche zeitung that he considered the deal to be fair even today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state prosecutors say bayernlb paid too much when it acquired austrian bank hgaa but eike hallitzky , a green party member of the bavarian state parliament , said schmidt may have personally profited from the deal .
hallitzky also claimed on german radio that schmidt and hgaa funds manager and majority shareholder tilo berlin had been friends , and that if berlin 's promotion to ceo of the new subsidiary had anything to do with their friendship , it would be scandalous .
schmidt is currently the only suspect in the investigation according to prosecutors , who also searched his private residence and hgaa offices in austria on wednesday .
bayernlb lost 5.2 billion euros last year , and while it received a 10 billion euro bailout from the bavarian government , it still may not have balanced all its debts for 2009 .
its hgaa subsidiary has also been struggling with the economic crisis , receiving upwards of 700 million euros from the austrian government in 2008 . acb / ap / reuters editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ausgestrahlt " reported on wednesday that only 10 percent of that was returned to germany as enriched uranium .
the anti-nuclear activists said the remaining 90 percent was stored in siberia , outdoors and in rusting containers .
uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .
about 10 to 15 percent of the material was treated and returned to germany .
urenco says it has meanwhile terminated cooperation with the russian company . government accused of " nuclear waste tourism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have protested against toxic waste shipments from germany following an inquiry by the left party , the government had already publicly acknowledged the exports in 2007 .
juergen maass , a spokesman for the environment ministry in berlin , on wednesday confirmed the shipments of depleted uranium to russia .
he emphasized that the shipments , although they did contain nuclear waste , were not illegal .
the federal office for radiation protection has said the exports were not subject to approval under the atomic energy act .
opposition parties have renewed criticism of the german government 's policy of exporting nuclear waste .
eva bulling-schroeter , environmental spokeswoman for the left party , called for an end to such shipments : " it is time the government stopped trivializing nuclear waste tourism . "
permanent storage of nuclear waste is not only an unsolved problem and a controversial issue in germany , as it does elsewhere in europe .
in france this week , an arte television documentary and the newspaper liberation said that more than 100 tons of depleted uranium from french power plants have been stored in an open-air complex in siberia .
furthermore , according to an italian environmental organization , at least two dozen ships containing radioactive waste have been sunk in the ionion sea off southern italy in order to bypass local laws. db / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say he likely never will . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency i am a us citizen , loyal to my country .
president obama is a talker .
he issues grand visions from his mouth .
in contrast , george bush said little , evoked no praise , but did more to confront the real enemies of peace than has been done by president obama .
the world looks at this talker as a visionary .
i think the world is deceived .
the award of this prize so early cheapens it and is yet another mistake of the committee as was the choice of arafat , gore , and the others nominated in the past . - randolph a. latall , us given that obama has done absolutely nothing to merit the award of any peace prize , never mind the nobel peace prize , simply goes to demonstrate how little value this prize now has beyond the 1.4 million euros to the recipient . it has more to do with adding cachet to the nobel prize via celebrity .
if obama had the slightest moral virtue , he would decline this prize . - charles smyth , great britain i think that he has shown good intentions and improved the atmosphere for peace .
he has only been in office for nine months .
significant actions that he has accomplished were cancelling the missile defense shield , laying the ground work for iran nuclear disarmament and solving the georgia issue with russia .
intentions have been substituted for results . - john reeder , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama won for " efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation " how can anybody be worthy of the nobel peace prize by just laying out a plan but has no hope of ever achieving much of the plan in reality ?
many people realize obama is not any more effective than the former bush administration .
by expanding military operations in afghanistan , he is still listening to diverse lobby groups in washington that advised g. w. bush on a stalled foreign policy ; from the road to peace in the middle east , to nuclear disarmament of countries who should have never been allowed by the un to acquire these weapons of mass destruction . - g. gosau , canada the nobel committee has recognized that president barack obama has set the stage for a worldwide era of enlightenment and peace .
in the 18th century , there was a philosophical wind that swept through the western world . the enlightenment espoused the principles of human dignity , freedom , and government by the people that are prominent in the texts of the declaration of independence and our us constitution .
today we are experiencing the birth of a second " age of enlightenment " which will effect not only western culture but have world-wide influence ; shaping human history for years in the future .
we are no longer satisfied with following leaders that tell us to stop thinking for ourselves but follow their direction on faith .
we are invigorated with dialogue on nuclear disarmament , reconsidering the death penalty , renewable energy , international cooperation , social justice , environmental concerns , education , human rights , universal health care , sex education , religious tolerance , diplomacy and the true implications of the rule of law .
like any change , there is resistance .
new social programs are called communist or socialist to distract the people from real purpose .
investments in our future are bashed as too expensive .
we ca n't let this opportunity slip away , and it will , if we do n't support it in our everyday lives by communicating with our leaders and discussing it with our friends .
it is time for americans to set aside our differences and unite for the common good of all .
president obama has presented us all with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and for that he deserves the nobel prize . - joseph suste , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader thinks chinese president hu jintao was more deserving of the prize it 's official , the international community has lost its collective mind .
obama ?
peace prize ?
what , during his lifetime , has he done to serve the world in the pursuit of peace ?
nothing .
clearly the nobel peace prize should be renamed the " worlds most popular person prize . " frankly , i 'm disgusted . - thor hougen , us i think he deserves it .
he is the first african-american president who gives a hope for all peoples of the world .
here in israel there is anti-obama propaganda , even from the chairman of the israeli parliament .
it is clear that the israeli public was anti-obama during the 2008 us election , it was not his ideology but his skin color . - mequanint birhanu , israel it is quite a recognition for just few months in the oval office .
personally , i like the choice but people who live in former soviet republics are feeling the chilling wind from the east .
without the security blanket of the missile shield , it is going to be cold .
i had president hu jintao as my favorite .
hu has done miracles with putin 's administration .
he made him trade rather than wage war .
hu maintained china 's one child policy risking demographic imbalance at home but globally it was a sound move .
hu is also instrumental at keeping peace in asia pacific region .
he builds roads , railroad , schools and hospitals for africans , instead of filling african corrupt government 's officials pockets with money .
hu is only allowing his people to repossess outer mongolia by peaceful migration .
i hope hu will receive the nobel peace price next year . - paul heinila , canada send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency us president barack obama has won the nobel peace prize .

the controversial block on child porn websites will be lifted and new rules will affect police powers .
there are new breakthroughs in the ongoing coalition negotiations in the new german government ahead of decisive talks scheduled this weekend .
negotiators for both parties announced agreements in the areas of internal security that suggested that the fdp 's libertarian agenda is forcing concessions from the conservative cdu .
on the question of website blocks , an initiative introduced by cdu family minister ursula van der leyen earlier this year to combat child pornography , the two parties agreed to try to delete rather than block offending websites .
in a year 's time , the success of the deletion policy will be assessed .
police powers curbed important agreements are designed to curtail police powers : cdu interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced that the use of stored private data in police investigations would be limited to extremely dangerous situations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn sites are to be deleted rather than blocked the police will also have to apply to the federal public prosecutor to conduct secret online searches of computers , rather than local district courts .
the power to conduct online searches will not be extended to other security authorities like the secret service .
the free liberals could also record some success in the question of the protection of professional secrets .
under the new government agenda , all lawyers , not only criminal defense lawyers , will be allowed to withhold sensitive information from the police on professional grounds .
an official enquiry will be initiated to decide whether a similar rule can cover journalists .
prison sentences extended in addition , the two parties agreed that the maximum prison sentence for murder in the case of young criminals would be extended from 10 to 15 years .
a so-called " warning-shot-detention " of up to four weeks will also be introduced for young criminals placed on probation .
fdp domestic policy spokesman max stadler declared that he had expected the cdu bow to the fdp 's demands on certain issues .

deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?
if the answers to all these turn out to be ' yes ' , then maybe … just maybe … author : nick amies editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

the solar industry , however , is warning against taking drastic steps . in coalition talks , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have discussed drastically slashing renewable energy subsidies as the industry becomes more efficient .
" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .
this is a schedule both the economic and the environmental committees of the upcoming coalition could agree on . costs for solar plants have dropped according to holger krawinkel , an energy expert at the federation of german consumer organizations , cuts are necessary for compensation for selling solar power back to the public grid . " if costs for solar plants drop by 30 percent , then it 's not quite logical why the compensation should n't be proportionately reduced , " he said .
" our demands have been met : the plants have gotten cheaper ; the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- planned a reduction anyway . " carsten koernig , executive director of the german solar industry association , said subsidies to the industry are cut by 10 percent each year as it is .
this was appropriate , considering that the industry had been able to cut its costs by 50 percent since 2000 , he added . " now the question is : are there even bigger margins ?
we warn against large-scale changes , " said koernig , who conceded that the new government may want to assess the need for change , considering the recent cost cuts . large-scale reductions , however , could have a negative impact on customers ' willingness to make the initial investment in solar panels , should the compensation for selling back to the grid be slashed too drastrically . however , koernig said he suspects another motive : " we all know that -lsb- the german government -rsb- mainly want to implement longer runs for nuclear power facilities . " bildunterschrift : the solar industry has drastically reduced the cost of panels in recent years selling energy to the public grid solar energy customers who have installed solar cells at home and feed energy into the public grid are now getting paid a hefty 43 cents -lrb- $ 0.64 -rrb- per kilowatt hour as an incentive to purchase the initial solar set-up . the costs of subsidies is passed on to all electricity consumers , said koernig . " this leads to an increase of the electricity tariff by 0.5 percent , " he added .
in comparison , the energy wasted by leaving electronic devices in stand-by mode adds up to 10 percent of an average customer 's bill . some are claiming this amount is too high .
according to krawinkel , the subsidy should drop proportionally .
" do i need a return of 15 or 20 percent -lsb- for solar energy sold back to the grid -rsb- , or should n't three , four , five percent do the job of an incentive for this innovation ? " the purpose of the eeg is not to finance extra incomes , " he said . author : sarah steffen editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

" this case is technically and factually baseless , " said werner schmidt , who was the bank 's chief executive two years ago when the bavarian bank acquired the austrian unit hypo group alpe-adria -lrb- hgaa -rrb- .
bayernlb is the second-biggest regional bank in germany .
it paid 1.6 billion euros for 67percent of hgaa 's shares in may 2007 .
german prosecutors claim schmidt , who left the bank in 2008 , knowingly paid too much for the deal .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state prosecutors say bayernlb paid too much when it acquired austrian bank hgaa but eike hallitzky , a green party member of the bavarian state parliament , said schmidt may have personally profited from the deal .
hallitzky also claimed on german radio that schmidt and hgaa funds manager and majority shareholder tilo berlin had been friends , and that if berlin 's promotion to ceo of the new subsidiary had anything to do with their friendship , it would be scandalous .
schmidt is currently the only suspect in the investigation according to prosecutors , who also searched his private residence and hgaa offices in austria on wednesday .
bayernlb lost 5.2 billion euros last year , and while it received a 10 billion euro bailout from the bavarian government , it still may not have balanced all its debts for 2009 .

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

the controversial block on child porn websites will be lifted and new rules will affect police powers .
there are new breakthroughs in the ongoing coalition negotiations in the new german government ahead of decisive talks scheduled this weekend .
negotiators for both parties announced agreements in the areas of internal security that suggested that the fdp 's libertarian agenda is forcing concessions from the conservative cdu .
on the question of website blocks , an initiative introduced by cdu family minister ursula van der leyen earlier this year to combat child pornography , the two parties agreed to try to delete rather than block offending websites .
in a year 's time , the success of the deletion policy will be assessed .
police powers curbed important agreements are designed to curtail police powers : cdu interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced that the use of stored private data in police investigations would be limited to extremely dangerous situations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn sites are to be deleted rather than blocked the police will also have to apply to the federal public prosecutor to conduct secret online searches of computers , rather than local district courts .
the power to conduct online searches will not be extended to other security authorities like the secret service .
the free liberals could also record some success in the question of the protection of professional secrets .
under the new government agenda , all lawyers , not only criminal defense lawyers , will be allowed to withhold sensitive information from the police on professional grounds .
an official enquiry will be initiated to decide whether a similar rule can cover journalists .
prison sentences extended in addition , the two parties agreed that the maximum prison sentence for murder in the case of young criminals would be extended from 10 to 15 years .
a so-called " warning-shot-detention " of up to four weeks will also be introduced for young criminals placed on probation .
fdp domestic policy spokesman max stadler declared that he had expected the cdu bow to the fdp 's demands on certain issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 15.10.2009 europe 's top teams dominate list of world cup contenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's top teams will be among those to beat in 2010 with qualification secured , europe 's top teams are looking towards next summer 's world cup in south africa with some confidence .
deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?
if the answers to all these turn out to be ' yes ' , then maybe … just maybe … author : nick amies editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .
the oecd 's findings on the educational circumstances of immigrants in germany were similar to those of pisa studies. bk / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .
merkel herself has called nuclear power " an important bridge technology " on the way to cleaner and safer power for future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to see nuclear plants shut down nuclear power unpopular but vital nuclear power is highly unpopular in germany , with shipments of nuclear waste regularly triggering angry protests .
the country has no permanent storage site for the waste .
but germany is eager to reduce its dependence on volatile gas and oil imports from russia or the middle east and with only limited domestic resources , nuclear power is a strategically important energy source .
the new government plans , however , are vague , says fdp energy expert gudrun kopp , with details on which reactors will remain on line to be determined at a later date .
german media also report that merkel wants to delay concrete decisions on the nuclear issue until after a key state election in north rhine-westphalia next may , which could lose her party a majority in the upper house of parliament .
business and industry are very much in favor of the move , but environmentalists have vowed street protests , if merkel and the fdp go ahead with their plans. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say he likely never will . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency i am a us citizen , loyal to my country .
president obama is a talker .
he issues grand visions from his mouth .
in contrast , george bush said little , evoked no praise , but did more to confront the real enemies of peace than has been done by president obama .
the world looks at this talker as a visionary .
i think the world is deceived .
the award of this prize so early cheapens it and is yet another mistake of the committee as was the choice of arafat , gore , and the others nominated in the past . - randolph a. latall , us given that obama has done absolutely nothing to merit the award of any peace prize , never mind the nobel peace prize , simply goes to demonstrate how little value this prize now has beyond the 1.4 million euros to the recipient . it has more to do with adding cachet to the nobel prize via celebrity .
if obama had the slightest moral virtue , he would decline this prize . - charles smyth , great britain i think that he has shown good intentions and improved the atmosphere for peace .
he has only been in office for nine months .
significant actions that he has accomplished were cancelling the missile defense shield , laying the ground work for iran nuclear disarmament and solving the georgia issue with russia .
intentions have been substituted for results . - john reeder , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama won for " efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation " how can anybody be worthy of the nobel peace prize by just laying out a plan but has no hope of ever achieving much of the plan in reality ?
many people realize obama is not any more effective than the former bush administration .
by expanding military operations in afghanistan , he is still listening to diverse lobby groups in washington that advised g. w. bush on a stalled foreign policy ; from the road to peace in the middle east , to nuclear disarmament of countries who should have never been allowed by the un to acquire these weapons of mass destruction . - g. gosau , canada the nobel committee has recognized that president barack obama has set the stage for a worldwide era of enlightenment and peace .
in the 18th century , there was a philosophical wind that swept through the western world . the enlightenment espoused the principles of human dignity , freedom , and government by the people that are prominent in the texts of the declaration of independence and our us constitution .
today we are experiencing the birth of a second " age of enlightenment " which will effect not only western culture but have world-wide influence ; shaping human history for years in the future .
we are no longer satisfied with following leaders that tell us to stop thinking for ourselves but follow their direction on faith .
we are invigorated with dialogue on nuclear disarmament , reconsidering the death penalty , renewable energy , international cooperation , social justice , environmental concerns , education , human rights , universal health care , sex education , religious tolerance , diplomacy and the true implications of the rule of law .
like any change , there is resistance .
new social programs are called communist or socialist to distract the people from real purpose .
investments in our future are bashed as too expensive .
we ca n't let this opportunity slip away , and it will , if we do n't support it in our everyday lives by communicating with our leaders and discussing it with our friends .
it is time for americans to set aside our differences and unite for the common good of all .
president obama has presented us all with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and for that he deserves the nobel prize . - joseph suste , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader thinks chinese president hu jintao was more deserving of the prize it 's official , the international community has lost its collective mind .
obama ?
peace prize ?
what , during his lifetime , has he done to serve the world in the pursuit of peace ?
nothing .
clearly the nobel peace prize should be renamed the " worlds most popular person prize . " frankly , i 'm disgusted . - thor hougen , us i think he deserves it .
he is the first african-american president who gives a hope for all peoples of the world .
here in israel there is anti-obama propaganda , even from the chairman of the israeli parliament .
it is clear that the israeli public was anti-obama during the 2008 us election , it was not his ideology but his skin color . - mequanint birhanu , israel it is quite a recognition for just few months in the oval office .
personally , i like the choice but people who live in former soviet republics are feeling the chilling wind from the east .
without the security blanket of the missile shield , it is going to be cold .
i had president hu jintao as my favorite .
hu has done miracles with putin 's administration .
he made him trade rather than wage war .
hu maintained china 's one child policy risking demographic imbalance at home but globally it was a sound move .
hu is also instrumental at keeping peace in asia pacific region .
he builds roads , railroad , schools and hospitals for africans , instead of filling african corrupt government 's officials pockets with money .
hu is only allowing his people to repossess outer mongolia by peaceful migration .
i hope hu will receive the nobel peace price next year . - paul heinila , canada send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .

however , turkey is still a long way from meeting the eu 's criteria for entry . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats agreed " unanimously " to stick with the last government 's position on turkey 's eu membership bid , sources from both parties told afp on thursday .
the previous coalition of the christian democrats with the center-left social democrats had called the negotiations an " open-ended process " with no guarantee of membership .
the deal between the parties is expected be worded in a similar fashion to merkel 's 2005 coalition agreement .
in that document , the parties said " if the eu is not in a position to take on new members or turkey can not fully meet all the criteria necessary for membership , turkey must be bound closely to european structures in a way that allows its privileged relationship with the eu to develop further . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozyand merkel oppose eu membership for turkey many had speculated prior to the talks that the new government would outline a tougher stance against turkey 's eu membership bid , since merkel 's conservatives are strongly opposed to it .
they prefer a " privileged partnership " for turkey instead .
turkey 's disputed eu bid the free democrats , on the other hand , is not against turkey 's membership in principle , but says there are " major deficits " in turkey 's efforts to meet eu criteria for entry .
the leader of the free democrats , guido westerwelle - who is widely expected to become germany 's new foreign minister - is open to membership , but says turkey first needs to resolve its ongoing dispute with eu-member cyprus and improve rights for the country 's kurds .
turkey has also been criticized for not making sufficient progress in improving its human rights record and reforming the judiciary .
the news of the coalition 's compromise on turkey comes one day after the european commission released its annual progress report on turkey 's bid to join the eu , which gave a mixed review .
whether or not to allow turkey accession into the eu has been a contentious issue in germany - and across europe - since official talks were opened in 2005 .

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .
romania 's troubled economy romania has gone through a sharp economic reversal in the past year , because of the global financial crisis and failed economic policies .
it turned from being the european union 's fastest-growing economy and an attractive target for foreign investors to a problem zone in desperate need of aid .
the imf , the world bank and the eu agreed to lend romania 20 billion euros in exchange for reforms , including an overhaul of its pension system and pledges to cut the public deficit , which is expected to top 7.3 percent of gross domestic product this year. bk / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .
if the three parties block croitoru 's appointment in ten days ' time , the ensuing uncertainty could jeopardise crucial economic reforms agreed as part of the imf-led bailout .
but the opposition also accuses the president of having personal motives behind his nomination .
psd head mircea geoana said basescu intentionally put forward a candidate who can not win in hopes of delaying the process past november 22 , when presidential elections are scheduled .
romania 's troubled economy romania has gone through a sharp economic reversal in the past year , because of the global financial crisis and failed economic policies .
it turned from being the european union 's fastest-growing economy and an attractive target for foreign investors to a problem zone in desperate need of aid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .

this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .

" this case is technically and factually baseless , " said werner schmidt , who was the bank 's chief executive two years ago when the bavarian bank acquired the austrian unit hypo group alpe-adria -lrb- hgaa -rrb- .
bayernlb is the second-biggest regional bank in germany .
it paid 1.6 billion euros for 67percent of hgaa 's shares in may 2007 .
german prosecutors claim schmidt , who left the bank in 2008 , knowingly paid too much for the deal .
criticism from state representative in support of schmidt , then-bavarian finance minister kurt faltlhauser told the german newspaper sueddetusche zeitung that he considered the deal to be fair even today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state prosecutors say bayernlb paid too much when it acquired austrian bank hgaa but eike hallitzky , a green party member of the bavarian state parliament , said schmidt may have personally profited from the deal .
hallitzky also claimed on german radio that schmidt and hgaa funds manager and majority shareholder tilo berlin had been friends , and that if berlin 's promotion to ceo of the new subsidiary had anything to do with their friendship , it would be scandalous .
schmidt is currently the only suspect in the investigation according to prosecutors , who also searched his private residence and hgaa offices in austria on wednesday .
bayernlb lost 5.2 billion euros last year , and while it received a 10 billion euro bailout from the bavarian government , it still may not have balanced all its debts for 2009 .
its hgaa subsidiary has also been struggling with the economic crisis , receiving upwards of 700 million euros from the austrian government in 2008 . acb / ap / reuters editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair literature -pipe- 15.10.2009 bookworms are rare in the land of goethe and schiller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some never pick up a book ; others fly through one a week germans are known around the world for being cultured , but not everyone in the country is necessarily a reader .
a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .
the oecd 's findings on the educational circumstances of immigrants in germany were similar to those of pisa studies. bk / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .

german media also report that merkel wants to delay concrete decisions on the nuclear issue until after a key state election in north rhine-westphalia next may , which could lose her party a majority in the upper house of parliament .

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .
merkel herself has called nuclear power " an important bridge technology " on the way to cleaner and safer power for future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to see nuclear plants shut down nuclear power unpopular but vital nuclear power is highly unpopular in germany , with shipments of nuclear waste regularly triggering angry protests .
the country has no permanent storage site for the waste .
but germany is eager to reduce its dependence on volatile gas and oil imports from russia or the middle east and with only limited domestic resources , nuclear power is a strategically important energy source .
the new government plans , however , are vague , says fdp energy expert gudrun kopp , with details on which reactors will remain on line to be determined at a later date .
german media also report that merkel wants to delay concrete decisions on the nuclear issue until after a key state election in north rhine-westphalia next may , which could lose her party a majority in the upper house of parliament .
business and industry are very much in favor of the move , but environmentalists have vowed street protests , if merkel and the fdp go ahead with their plans. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : frankfurt book fair authors are just like everyone else , says winner of german peace prize opinion : china did n't steal the show at frankfurt book fair italian claudio magris receives peace prize of german book trade dissident chinese writer criticizes lack of debate at book fair literature -pipe- 15.10.2009 bookworms are rare in the land of goethe and schiller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some never pick up a book ; others fly through one a week germans are known around the world for being cultured , but not everyone in the country is necessarily a reader .
a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .
the oecd 's findings on the educational circumstances of immigrants in germany were similar to those of pisa studies. bk / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motion follows remarks by williamson late last year in which he drastically downplayed the extent of the holocaust in an interview with a swedish journalist on german soil .
williamson alleged that nazi gas chambers were a fallacy and that only " 200,000 to 300,000 jews " had been killed by hitler 's regime .
the recognized number of deaths is around six million .
denying the mass murder of jews by the german nazi regime is classified as a hate crime in germany .
williamson has said he was offered assurances by the swedish television network that his comments would only be broadcast in sweden .
but german daily sueddeutsche zeitung said prosecutors had received a letter from the swedish television producers in which they deny offering such assurances .
regensburg judge johann ploed would not elaborate on what the penalty against williamson could be , but said " it would likely be a fine . "
williamson 's comments angered many catholic and jewish groups and led to widespread criticism of the vatican for moving to reconcile its splintered relationship with the sspx. dfm / dpa / afpd editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some say he likely never will . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency i am a us citizen , loyal to my country .
president obama is a talker .
he issues grand visions from his mouth .
in contrast , george bush said little , evoked no praise , but did more to confront the real enemies of peace than has been done by president obama .
the world looks at this talker as a visionary .
i think the world is deceived .
the award of this prize so early cheapens it and is yet another mistake of the committee as was the choice of arafat , gore , and the others nominated in the past . - randolph a. latall , us given that obama has done absolutely nothing to merit the award of any peace prize , never mind the nobel peace prize , simply goes to demonstrate how little value this prize now has beyond the 1.4 million euros to the recipient . it has more to do with adding cachet to the nobel prize via celebrity .
if obama had the slightest moral virtue , he would decline this prize . - charles smyth , great britain i think that he has shown good intentions and improved the atmosphere for peace .
he has only been in office for nine months .
significant actions that he has accomplished were cancelling the missile defense shield , laying the ground work for iran nuclear disarmament and solving the georgia issue with russia .
intentions have been substituted for results . - john reeder , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama won for " efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation " how can anybody be worthy of the nobel peace prize by just laying out a plan but has no hope of ever achieving much of the plan in reality ?
many people realize obama is not any more effective than the former bush administration .
by expanding military operations in afghanistan , he is still listening to diverse lobby groups in washington that advised g. w. bush on a stalled foreign policy ; from the road to peace in the middle east , to nuclear disarmament of countries who should have never been allowed by the un to acquire these weapons of mass destruction . - g. gosau , canada the nobel committee has recognized that president barack obama has set the stage for a worldwide era of enlightenment and peace .
in the 18th century , there was a philosophical wind that swept through the western world . the enlightenment espoused the principles of human dignity , freedom , and government by the people that are prominent in the texts of the declaration of independence and our us constitution .
today we are experiencing the birth of a second " age of enlightenment " which will effect not only western culture but have world-wide influence ; shaping human history for years in the future .
we are no longer satisfied with following leaders that tell us to stop thinking for ourselves but follow their direction on faith .
we are invigorated with dialogue on nuclear disarmament , reconsidering the death penalty , renewable energy , international cooperation , social justice , environmental concerns , education , human rights , universal health care , sex education , religious tolerance , diplomacy and the true implications of the rule of law .
like any change , there is resistance .
new social programs are called communist or socialist to distract the people from real purpose .
investments in our future are bashed as too expensive .
we ca n't let this opportunity slip away , and it will , if we do n't support it in our everyday lives by communicating with our leaders and discussing it with our friends .
it is time for americans to set aside our differences and unite for the common good of all .
president obama has presented us all with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and for that he deserves the nobel prize . - joseph suste , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader thinks chinese president hu jintao was more deserving of the prize it 's official , the international community has lost its collective mind .

twenty years on , it now appears relatively untouched by the global downturn , and promises to be europe ’ s only economy to show positive growth this year . poland 's international airports are doing a bustling trade , thanks to the planeloads of polish holidaymakers booking charter flights to destinations such as the egyptian riviera , crete , morocco and thailand .
it seems that poles ' willingness to travel has n't been impacted by the financial tremors that have hit europe .
in fact , the polish middle class continues to spend like nobody 's business , and foreign travel is high on its list .
jacek dabrowski , financial director of the travel agency triada says that , until 2008 , the polish outbound tourist market grew by 40 percent each year , and this year 's results promise to be better than the european average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's middle class does n't skimp on holidays " according to statistics from eurostat , the number of customers choosing foreign holidays is growing , " said dabrowski .
" organized outgoing travel in poland has great potential for growth .
the reason is the growing purchasing power of poles since eu accession , which means that poles are now choosing better hotels , more expensive destinations and generally spending more money abroad . "
but how do polish tour operators manage to keep their heads above water with competing large german travel companies treating poland as a lucrative market ?
according to dabrowski , the polish companies ' edge lies in their flexibility .
having to build up businesses from scratch and steer them through tough market transformations , polish entrepreneurs have learned to take risks and adapt quickly .
but it 's not just in the holiday market that evidence of economic success abounds in poland .
there 's the growing number of foreign direct investments , which last year alone totalled a cool $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.7 billion euros -rrb- .
increasingly , investors are looking for more than just cheap labor ; they 're setting up service and r & d centers , for example .
economic shock therapy " poland has become the only country in europe where consumers are spending more than they used to spend a year ago , and where corporations are spending more , " said slawomir majman , president of the polish information and foreign investment agency in warsaw .
" poland 's exports are growing .
and most importantly , poland is delivering the product which is definitely in short supply in 2009 : economic stability . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile factory in poland : the country has been protected from the financial crisis it all seems light years away from the autumn of 1989 , when it became clear that the outgoing communist regime had not only mismanaged poland 's economy on a shocking scale , but also run up billions of us dollars in foreign debt .
then , food queues , chronic shortages and rampant inflation earned poland the reputation of being the sick man of europe .
at the warsaw school of economics , professor leszek balcerowicz put together a " shock therapy " plan to invigorate the country 's economy .
he 's now known as the father of poland 's market reforms , but looking back , he admits that the challenges facing the country two decades ago were daunting .
" poland was burdened by the troubles of communism - huge waste , inefficiency , declining production , " said balcerowicz .
" in addition , there was huge foreign debt incurred in the 1970s , and a runaway inflation of 50 percent a month .
it was an economic catastrophe . "
balcerowicz 's bitter pill was a strict monetarist approach , coupled with fast-paced market reforms , which quickly put poland 's house in order .
even though polish governments have changed frequently since then , balcerowicz is happy that politicians have consistently kept the country 's finances in check , and made the most of poland 's natural advantage : its size .
new generation untouched by communism " we are a much larger economy than the baltics , or the czech republic , or slovakia , or hungary , " he said .
" as a result , we suffer less from external shocks .
until 2007 , monetary policy in poland was pretty conservative .
the rate of credit growth was not very rapid , so we did n't develop a housing bubble .
i 'm happy that , as a governor of the national bank of poland until 2007 , i managed to bring inflation down from around 10 to 2 percent . "
as a new academic year starts at balcerowicz 's school of economics in warsaw , this year 's 19-year-old freshmen are the first generation to have been born in a democratic poland .
never having known communism , their entire lives have been punctuated by the growth of poland 's market economy .
now that solid foundations have been laid , it will be their job to continue the process of catching up with the world 's most developed economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 15.10.2009 20 years after communism 's collapse , poland 's economy is thriving großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's marketplace has been restored , and the economy is growing in 1989 , poland ’ s economy lay in tatters .
twenty years on , it now appears relatively untouched by the global downturn , and promises to be europe ’ s only economy to show positive growth this year . poland 's international airports are doing a bustling trade , thanks to the planeloads of polish holidaymakers booking charter flights to destinations such as the egyptian riviera , crete , morocco and thailand .
it seems that poles ' willingness to travel has n't been impacted by the financial tremors that have hit europe .
in fact , the polish middle class continues to spend like nobody 's business , and foreign travel is high on its list .
jacek dabrowski , financial director of the travel agency triada says that , until 2008 , the polish outbound tourist market grew by 40 percent each year , and this year 's results promise to be better than the european average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's middle class does n't skimp on holidays " according to statistics from eurostat , the number of customers choosing foreign holidays is growing , " said dabrowski .
" organized outgoing travel in poland has great potential for growth .
the reason is the growing purchasing power of poles since eu accession , which means that poles are now choosing better hotels , more expensive destinations and generally spending more money abroad . "
but how do polish tour operators manage to keep their heads above water with competing large german travel companies treating poland as a lucrative market ?
according to dabrowski , the polish companies ' edge lies in their flexibility .
having to build up businesses from scratch and steer them through tough market transformations , polish entrepreneurs have learned to take risks and adapt quickly .
but it 's not just in the holiday market that evidence of economic success abounds in poland .
there 's the growing number of foreign direct investments , which last year alone totalled a cool $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.7 billion euros -rrb- .
increasingly , investors are looking for more than just cheap labor ; they 're setting up service and r & d centers , for example .
economic shock therapy " poland has become the only country in europe where consumers are spending more than they used to spend a year ago , and where corporations are spending more , " said slawomir majman , president of the polish information and foreign investment agency in warsaw .
" poland 's exports are growing .
and most importantly , poland is delivering the product which is definitely in short supply in 2009 : economic stability . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile factory in poland : the country has been protected from the financial crisis it all seems light years away from the autumn of 1989 , when it became clear that the outgoing communist regime had not only mismanaged poland 's economy on a shocking scale , but also run up billions of us dollars in foreign debt .
then , food queues , chronic shortages and rampant inflation earned poland the reputation of being the sick man of europe .
at the warsaw school of economics , professor leszek balcerowicz put together a " shock therapy " plan to invigorate the country 's economy .
he 's now known as the father of poland 's market reforms , but looking back , he admits that the challenges facing the country two decades ago were daunting .
" poland was burdened by the troubles of communism - huge waste , inefficiency , declining production , " said balcerowicz .
" in addition , there was huge foreign debt incurred in the 1970s , and a runaway inflation of 50 percent a month .
it was an economic catastrophe . "
balcerowicz 's bitter pill was a strict monetarist approach , coupled with fast-paced market reforms , which quickly put poland 's house in order .
even though polish governments have changed frequently since then , balcerowicz is happy that politicians have consistently kept the country 's finances in check , and made the most of poland 's natural advantage : its size .
new generation untouched by communism " we are a much larger economy than the baltics , or the czech republic , or slovakia , or hungary , " he said .

as a new academic year starts at balcerowicz 's school of economics in warsaw , this year 's 19-year-old freshmen are the first generation to have been born in a democratic poland .
never having known communism , their entire lives have been punctuated by the growth of poland 's market economy .

the solar industry , however , is warning against taking drastic steps . in coalition talks , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have discussed drastically slashing renewable energy subsidies as the industry becomes more efficient .
" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .
this is a schedule both the economic and the environmental committees of the upcoming coalition could agree on . costs for solar plants have dropped according to holger krawinkel , an energy expert at the federation of german consumer organizations , cuts are necessary for compensation for selling solar power back to the public grid . " if costs for solar plants drop by 30 percent , then it 's not quite logical why the compensation should n't be proportionately reduced , " he said .
" our demands have been met : the plants have gotten cheaper ; the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- planned a reduction anyway . " carsten koernig , executive director of the german solar industry association , said subsidies to the industry are cut by 10 percent each year as it is .
this was appropriate , considering that the industry had been able to cut its costs by 50 percent since 2000 , he added . " now the question is : are there even bigger margins ?
we warn against large-scale changes , " said koernig , who conceded that the new government may want to assess the need for change , considering the recent cost cuts . large-scale reductions , however , could have a negative impact on customers ' willingness to make the initial investment in solar panels , should the compensation for selling back to the grid be slashed too drastrically . however , koernig said he suspects another motive : " we all know that -lsb- the german government -rsb- mainly want to implement longer runs for nuclear power facilities . " bildunterschrift : the solar industry has drastically reduced the cost of panels in recent years selling energy to the public grid solar energy customers who have installed solar cells at home and feed energy into the public grid are now getting paid a hefty 43 cents -lrb- $ 0.64 -rrb- per kilowatt hour as an incentive to purchase the initial solar set-up . the costs of subsidies is passed on to all electricity consumers , said koernig . " this leads to an increase of the electricity tariff by 0.5 percent , " he added .
in comparison , the energy wasted by leaving electronic devices in stand-by mode adds up to 10 percent of an average customer 's bill . some are claiming this amount is too high .
according to krawinkel , the subsidy should drop proportionally .

" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .

" this leads to an increase of the electricity tariff by 0.5 percent , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 15.10.2009 20 years after communism 's collapse , poland 's economy is thriving großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's marketplace has been restored , and the economy is growing in 1989 , poland ’ s economy lay in tatters .
twenty years on , it now appears relatively untouched by the global downturn , and promises to be europe ’ s only economy to show positive growth this year . poland 's international airports are doing a bustling trade , thanks to the planeloads of polish holidaymakers booking charter flights to destinations such as the egyptian riviera , crete , morocco and thailand .
it seems that poles ' willingness to travel has n't been impacted by the financial tremors that have hit europe .
in fact , the polish middle class continues to spend like nobody 's business , and foreign travel is high on its list .
jacek dabrowski , financial director of the travel agency triada says that , until 2008 , the polish outbound tourist market grew by 40 percent each year , and this year 's results promise to be better than the european average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's middle class does n't skimp on holidays " according to statistics from eurostat , the number of customers choosing foreign holidays is growing , " said dabrowski .
" organized outgoing travel in poland has great potential for growth .
the reason is the growing purchasing power of poles since eu accession , which means that poles are now choosing better hotels , more expensive destinations and generally spending more money abroad . "
but how do polish tour operators manage to keep their heads above water with competing large german travel companies treating poland as a lucrative market ?
according to dabrowski , the polish companies ' edge lies in their flexibility .
having to build up businesses from scratch and steer them through tough market transformations , polish entrepreneurs have learned to take risks and adapt quickly .
but it 's not just in the holiday market that evidence of economic success abounds in poland .
there 's the growing number of foreign direct investments , which last year alone totalled a cool $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.7 billion euros -rrb- .
increasingly , investors are looking for more than just cheap labor ; they 're setting up service and r & d centers , for example .
economic shock therapy " poland has become the only country in europe where consumers are spending more than they used to spend a year ago , and where corporations are spending more , " said slawomir majman , president of the polish information and foreign investment agency in warsaw .
" poland 's exports are growing .
and most importantly , poland is delivering the product which is definitely in short supply in 2009 : economic stability . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile factory in poland : the country has been protected from the financial crisis it all seems light years away from the autumn of 1989 , when it became clear that the outgoing communist regime had not only mismanaged poland 's economy on a shocking scale , but also run up billions of us dollars in foreign debt .
then , food queues , chronic shortages and rampant inflation earned poland the reputation of being the sick man of europe .
at the warsaw school of economics , professor leszek balcerowicz put together a " shock therapy " plan to invigorate the country 's economy .
he 's now known as the father of poland 's market reforms , but looking back , he admits that the challenges facing the country two decades ago were daunting .
" poland was burdened by the troubles of communism - huge waste , inefficiency , declining production , " said balcerowicz .
" in addition , there was huge foreign debt incurred in the 1970s , and a runaway inflation of 50 percent a month .
it was an economic catastrophe . "
balcerowicz 's bitter pill was a strict monetarist approach , coupled with fast-paced market reforms , which quickly put poland 's house in order .
even though polish governments have changed frequently since then , balcerowicz is happy that politicians have consistently kept the country 's finances in check , and made the most of poland 's natural advantage : its size .
new generation untouched by communism " we are a much larger economy than the baltics , or the czech republic , or slovakia , or hungary , " he said .
" as a result , we suffer less from external shocks .
until 2007 , monetary policy in poland was pretty conservative .
the rate of credit growth was not very rapid , so we did n't develop a housing bubble .
i 'm happy that , as a governor of the national bank of poland until 2007 , i managed to bring inflation down from around 10 to 2 percent . "
as a new academic year starts at balcerowicz 's school of economics in warsaw , this year 's 19-year-old freshmen are the first generation to have been born in a democratic poland .
never having known communism , their entire lives have been punctuated by the growth of poland 's market economy .
now that solid foundations have been laid , it will be their job to continue the process of catching up with the world 's most developed economies .

the controversial block on child porn websites will be lifted and new rules will affect police powers .
there are new breakthroughs in the ongoing coalition negotiations in the new german government ahead of decisive talks scheduled this weekend .
negotiators for both parties announced agreements in the areas of internal security that suggested that the fdp 's libertarian agenda is forcing concessions from the conservative cdu .
on the question of website blocks , an initiative introduced by cdu family minister ursula van der leyen earlier this year to combat child pornography , the two parties agreed to try to delete rather than block offending websites .
in a year 's time , the success of the deletion policy will be assessed .
police powers curbed important agreements are designed to curtail police powers : cdu interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced that the use of stored private data in police investigations would be limited to extremely dangerous situations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn sites are to be deleted rather than blocked the police will also have to apply to the federal public prosecutor to conduct secret online searches of computers , rather than local district courts .
the power to conduct online searches will not be extended to other security authorities like the secret service .
the free liberals could also record some success in the question of the protection of professional secrets .
under the new government agenda , all lawyers , not only criminal defense lawyers , will be allowed to withhold sensitive information from the police on professional grounds .
an official enquiry will be initiated to decide whether a similar rule can cover journalists .
prison sentences extended in addition , the two parties agreed that the maximum prison sentence for murder in the case of young criminals would be extended from 10 to 15 years .
a so-called " warning-shot-detention " of up to four weeks will also be introduced for young criminals placed on probation .
fdp domestic policy spokesman max stadler declared that he had expected the cdu bow to the fdp 's demands on certain issues .
" after all , we were elected to bring in changes and improvements , " he told reporters. bk / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the controversial block on child porn websites will be lifted and new rules will affect police powers .
there are new breakthroughs in the ongoing coalition negotiations in the new german government ahead of decisive talks scheduled this weekend .
negotiators for both parties announced agreements in the areas of internal security that suggested that the fdp 's libertarian agenda is forcing concessions from the conservative cdu .
on the question of website blocks , an initiative introduced by cdu family minister ursula van der leyen earlier this year to combat child pornography , the two parties agreed to try to delete rather than block offending websites .
in a year 's time , the success of the deletion policy will be assessed .
police powers curbed important agreements are designed to curtail police powers : cdu interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced that the use of stored private data in police investigations would be limited to extremely dangerous situations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn sites are to be deleted rather than blocked the police will also have to apply to the federal public prosecutor to conduct secret online searches of computers , rather than local district courts .
the power to conduct online searches will not be extended to other security authorities like the secret service .
the free liberals could also record some success in the question of the protection of professional secrets .
under the new government agenda , all lawyers , not only criminal defense lawyers , will be allowed to withhold sensitive information from the police on professional grounds .
an official enquiry will be initiated to decide whether a similar rule can cover journalists .
prison sentences extended in addition , the two parties agreed that the maximum prison sentence for murder in the case of young criminals would be extended from 10 to 15 years .
a so-called " warning-shot-detention " of up to four weeks will also be introduced for young criminals placed on probation .
fdp domestic policy spokesman max stadler declared that he had expected the cdu bow to the fdp 's demands on certain issues .
" after all , we were elected to bring in changes and improvements , " he told reporters. bk / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .
the plant was used to produce fuel for nuclear power stations in france , which has the second largest network of nuclear facilities after the united states. dfm / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?

the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?

a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .

french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .
as a mass phenomenon , and in view of the present food crisis , the only term that seems appropriate to characterize the fact that that even today over 1.2 billion people are overfed is cynicism .
what this means in effect for word agriculture is that animal food products - especially those based on grain-eating livestock - require far more land and water to produce the same quantity of food for each individual .
and we can no longer afford to do this . dr. susanne neubert is a researcher in the environmental policy and management of natural resources department at the german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- . based in bonn , the german development institute draws together the knowledge of development research available worldwide , dedicating its work to key issues facing the future of development policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 15.10.2009 never have so many people suffered from hunger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25,000 people die everyday from hunger-related causes on this year 's world food day , some 1.6 billion people will experience hunger .
this means that every 6th to 7th person in the world has too little to eat .
dr. susanne neubert explains how things got this bad . this development was to be expected .
the past year was marked by three global crises , all of which had negative impacts on the food situation worldwide .
it started with the 2007-2008 food crisis , which was sparked by extremely high food prices and caused a rise in the number of people exposed to hunger from 800 million to 900 million .
it was followed virtually at once by the economic and financial crisis , which further exacerbated world food situation .
the third crisis , climate change , manifested itself in the same period of time , particularly in major droughts and crop failures in many parts of the world . but back to the topic of the food crisis .
following years of low food prices - which benefitted the urban population in developing countries , while at the same time harming small-scale agriculture - food prices suddenly soared in 2006-2007 , soon reaching record levels .
the reasons for this rise in prices were many and varied .
on the one hand , high oil prices led to a rise in production costs , above all for diesel and fertilizers .
on the other hand , the numerous biodiesel support programs adopted by a good number of industrialized countries served to raise the competitiveness of biodiesel , leading regionally to further rises in food prices .
extensive crop failures , e.g. in australia , led , in addition , to a rapid and sharp depletion of world grain stocks .
this , in turn , led to " panic purchasing " , and many countries imposed restrictions on food imports with the aim of securing their own populations ' food supply .
this in turn encouraged financial market speculation , leading to further price increases . financial instability played a role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basic nutrition is a luxury to some as far as medium-term developments are concerned , though , it appeared at first that the food crisis had one positive effect : growing expectations that investment in agricultural development might pay off again , restoring the economic viability of small-scale agriculture .
however , the world was then shaken by the economic and financial crisis before any effects of this kind had been able to materialize .
commodity prices went into decline again , dragging grain prices in the most important international markets along with them .
while this entailed a slight short-term improvement in the food situation , it ultimately undercut incentives to invest in the agricultural sector , leading to a decline in the ability to invest .
declining direct investments and remittances from abroad as well as sinking government revenues led to sharp declines in household incomes , especially in poor developing countries . since a crucial factor in investment decisions is not only the current price level but its stability as well , the economic crisis has served to seriously hamper investment decisions .
for the famers affected , this rising uncertainty is reflected in increasingly costly loans at markedly unfavorable terms . the food crisis is thus by no means over , even though this may have seemed to be the case during the brief improvement in the food situation , and with the economic crisis drawing attention away from the food crisis .
it is still very much with us , and will continue to be with us until effective counter-measures have been taken . so , what can we do ? investing in agriculture is essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farming needs more financial support , says neubert despite the setbacks recently experienced , increased investment in agricultural development continues to be the only way to increase the food supply and to enable poor countries in particular to lower their dependence on international grain prices .
it is essential that steps be taken to better protect agricultural systems against sharply changing weather events due to climate change , as well as to shield them more effectively from the effects of volatile developments in world market prices .
but another factor of major importance is that the financial commitments made to the un world food programme by industrialized countries be honored in full and that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- adopt a coherent policy designed to mitigate " external shocks " of this kind . however , developing countries also need to step up their engagement as far as a consistent implementation of the comprehensive africa agricultural programme -lrb- caadp -rrb- , a fledgling structure of the new partnership for africa ’ s development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , is concerned .
it will take nothing less than a " green revolution " in africa to make up for the deficits of the past .
instead of following the old model , though , it should contain a policy geared to consistent adaptation to climate change and remain mindful of the sharp fluctuations in international prices for agricultural inputs .
this would imply a shift from agriculture based on high levels of external inputs to land management centered on efforts to conserve water and to raise soil fertility and geared to intelligently combining these strategies with sustainable seed cultivation and irrigation technologies , with the aim of increasing local buffer capacities for times of drought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. susanne neubert leading regional powers like china and india should , in addition , become involved in working out crisis plans designed to increase international buffer capacities , including , for example , world grain stocks , bearing their own situation in mind as well .
one thing that would be called for is development of strategies to reduce the increasingly meat-based nutritional habits of the more prosperous segments of the world population .
not only that - over-nutrition is plainly and simply unhealthy .

the facility had a license to store more than 22 kg of plutonium , but authorities are nonetheless curious as to why the extra 14 kg went unregistered .
" we need to have some transparency in this matter because this is not normal , " said the french junior environment minister , chantal jouanno .
france 's nuclear safety watchdog , the asn , said safety measures at the facility were reduced as a result of the quantity of plutonium registered there .
the asn said the incident did not pose any threat to security , but has pushed for a re-examination of procedures ensuring the fissile material can not be used to trigger a chain reaction .
the watchdog has also ordered that dismantling work at the facility be halted over worker safety fears .
much focus has been given to the revelation that the extra plutonium was discovered in june but not reported until now .
french ecology minister jean-louis borloo said he " profoundly regretted that there was a delay between the discovery of the stocks and the decision to report them . "
henri maubert , a spokesman for the cadarache facility , said no effort was made to hide the discovery , and that administrators " were just waiting to get a better overall view " before informing the authorities .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

some say he likely never will . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
nobel honor comes too early in obama presidency i am a us citizen , loyal to my country .
president obama is a talker .
he issues grand visions from his mouth .
in contrast , george bush said little , evoked no praise , but did more to confront the real enemies of peace than has been done by president obama .
the world looks at this talker as a visionary .
i think the world is deceived .
the award of this prize so early cheapens it and is yet another mistake of the committee as was the choice of arafat , gore , and the others nominated in the past . - randolph a. latall , us given that obama has done absolutely nothing to merit the award of any peace prize , never mind the nobel peace prize , simply goes to demonstrate how little value this prize now has beyond the 1.4 million euros to the recipient . it has more to do with adding cachet to the nobel prize via celebrity .
if obama had the slightest moral virtue , he would decline this prize . - charles smyth , great britain i think that he has shown good intentions and improved the atmosphere for peace .
he has only been in office for nine months .
significant actions that he has accomplished were cancelling the missile defense shield , laying the ground work for iran nuclear disarmament and solving the georgia issue with russia .
intentions have been substituted for results . - john reeder , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama won for " efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation " how can anybody be worthy of the nobel peace prize by just laying out a plan but has no hope of ever achieving much of the plan in reality ?
many people realize obama is not any more effective than the former bush administration .
by expanding military operations in afghanistan , he is still listening to diverse lobby groups in washington that advised g. w. bush on a stalled foreign policy ; from the road to peace in the middle east , to nuclear disarmament of countries who should have never been allowed by the un to acquire these weapons of mass destruction . - g. gosau , canada the nobel committee has recognized that president barack obama has set the stage for a worldwide era of enlightenment and peace .
in the 18th century , there was a philosophical wind that swept through the western world . the enlightenment espoused the principles of human dignity , freedom , and government by the people that are prominent in the texts of the declaration of independence and our us constitution .
today we are experiencing the birth of a second " age of enlightenment " which will effect not only western culture but have world-wide influence ; shaping human history for years in the future .
we are no longer satisfied with following leaders that tell us to stop thinking for ourselves but follow their direction on faith .
we are invigorated with dialogue on nuclear disarmament , reconsidering the death penalty , renewable energy , international cooperation , social justice , environmental concerns , education , human rights , universal health care , sex education , religious tolerance , diplomacy and the true implications of the rule of law .
like any change , there is resistance .
new social programs are called communist or socialist to distract the people from real purpose .
investments in our future are bashed as too expensive .
we ca n't let this opportunity slip away , and it will , if we do n't support it in our everyday lives by communicating with our leaders and discussing it with our friends .
it is time for americans to set aside our differences and unite for the common good of all .
president obama has presented us all with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and for that he deserves the nobel prize . - joseph suste , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one reader thinks chinese president hu jintao was more deserving of the prize it 's official , the international community has lost its collective mind .
obama ?
peace prize ?
what , during his lifetime , has he done to serve the world in the pursuit of peace ?
nothing .
clearly the nobel peace prize should be renamed the " worlds most popular person prize . " frankly , i 'm disgusted . - thor hougen , us i think he deserves it .
he is the first african-american president who gives a hope for all peoples of the world .
here in israel there is anti-obama propaganda , even from the chairman of the israeli parliament .
it is clear that the israeli public was anti-obama during the 2008 us election , it was not his ideology but his skin color . - mequanint birhanu , israel it is quite a recognition for just few months in the oval office .
personally , i like the choice but people who live in former soviet republics are feeling the chilling wind from the east .
without the security blanket of the missile shield , it is going to be cold .
i had president hu jintao as my favorite .
hu has done miracles with putin 's administration .
he made him trade rather than wage war .
hu maintained china 's one child policy risking demographic imbalance at home but globally it was a sound move .
hu is also instrumental at keeping peace in asia pacific region .
he builds roads , railroad , schools and hospitals for africans , instead of filling african corrupt government 's officials pockets with money .
hu is only allowing his people to repossess outer mongolia by peaceful migration .
i hope hu will receive the nobel peace price next year . - paul heinila , canada send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 15.10.2009 europe 's top teams dominate list of world cup contenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's top teams will be among those to beat in 2010 with qualification secured , europe 's top teams are looking towards next summer 's world cup in south africa with some confidence .
deutsche welle looks at the top five 's chances of success . nine of europe 's world cup qualifiers are already planning for the 2010 world cup after the group stages ended on wednesday night .
a further four european teams will qualify through the play-off rounds , meaning europe will be represented by thirteen teams in south africa next summer .
the likes of switzerland , denmark , slovakia and serbia claimed automatic qualification by winning the respective groups , alongside five of europe 's top sides : spain , the netherlands , italy , germany and england .
these teams , rated among fifa 's top 10 sides in the world , are among those countries being viewed as potential world champions .
spain : european champions with an embarrassment of riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fit fernando torres will be a handful for any defense ten games , ten wins – that 's the story of the european champions ' qualification campaign for south africa 2010 .
during their imperious march to the finals , vincente del bosque 's team hit 28 goals with five conceded , making them the second highest scoring team in european qualifying behind england .
with a strike force envied throughout europe , if not the world , and with an equally coveted midfield , spain look in good shape to make a serious challenge at the world cup .
their european championship success in 2008 finally laid the ghosts of underachievement to rest , proving at last that spain were capable of keeping their concentration and consistency throughout a major tournament .
difficult away wins against turkey , armenia and bosnia-herzegovina provided further proof that spain have added the ability to scrap for vital points to their repertoire of silky skills and incisive attacking .
concerns over the fitness of fernando torres and whether a forward line without the liverpool striker and his partner david villa would blunt spain 's attack seem laughable when one looks at the players in reserve : negrado , guiza , mata .
and if andres iniesta , xavi hernandez and co. are all fit and on song in the center of the park , spain will be a tough proposition for most teams in south africa .
holland : silky skills with added steel and mental strength bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new spirit of togetherness is evident in the dutch camp could south africa 2010 finally be the world cup the netherlands win ?
it seems that in the decades that have passed since their near-misses of ' 74 and ' 78 , the dutch have been going through some kind of traumatic , public therapy at world cups .
in the years following the cruyff era , every dutch team decided the best place to air their dirty laundry was at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
in-fighting and implosion became words synonymous with wildly talented but fractious dutch teams vying for the biggest prize .
each competition blighted by tantrums , however , seemed to be a step towards healing and 2010 could be the year that a harmonious netherlands team graces a world cup with the only baggage being the suitcases in their hotel rooms .
group 9 winners with a perfect record of eight wins out of eight , scoring 17 goals while conceding two , the dutch showed their usual flair and fluidity while exhibiting a new tough , resolute mindset .
this untypically dutch mentality , introduced by coach bert van marwijk , has helped focus minds which have so often in the past become distracted by pettiness .
if strong minds can continue to combine with fast feet , the dutch may finally find closure .
italy : battling champs prepared for hard-fought title defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's victories have not always been as balletic as this in much the same style as they won the world cup in 2006 , italy ground out the results to qualify for the 2010 finals rather than majestically sweep their way towards a title defense .
it could be argued that there has not been an italian team for some years which did n't favor the result over the manner of the victory and marcello lippi 's current charges certainly went for points rather than panache in winning group 8 .
that said , the names of champions written into world cup history are there because they beat those opponents put in their way , not because they played the most attractive soccer .
-lrb- if there was an alternative trophy for that , very few italy teams would feature on its roll of honor -rrb- .
ask any coach whether they would prefer to play sexy soccer and lose or ugly soccer and win , you 'll be hard pushed to find anyone who would n't take an unaesthetic victory .
if italy are to retain the world cup , a feat not achieved since brazil 's back-to-back wins in ' 58 and ' 62 , the experience gained from hard fought qualifying victories in places like tbilisi and larnaca will serve them well .
they might not be the most interesting team to watch right now but the italians will certainly be one of the most effective and therefore a team to be dismissed at peril .
germany : experienced stalwarts with the weapon of belief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fluffed their lines against finland home and away three world cup wins and four final losses since the championship began tells you all you need to know about germany when it comes to the big prizes -lrb- see also their equally impressive record at european level -rrb- .
germany may lumber through qualification , they may huff and puff through preliminary games at tournaments , they may even lose the odd group game to set up a dramatic must-win situation , but when it comes to the business end of proceedings , chances are germany 's name will be there among the last few contesting the trophy .
germany 's success is as much to do with attitude as it is with talent and organization .
while it gets up other people 's noses , germany 's apparent belief in their right to win the big tournaments is based on the statistics mentioned earlier .
when germany is n't playing well , it appears that the thought of someone else picking up a cup which should be theirs adds resilience to the german team .
germany showed this resilience in qualifying as group 4 winners , negotiating a potentially hazardous group and beating the dangerous russians twice .
less than impressive performances against finland home and away , however , prompted the usual grumblings but germany reached south africa with a game to spare , unbeaten and ready to begin another pursuit of their assumed birth right .
england : maintaining discipline while managing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney 's fitness is important to england 's world cup challenge expectation has been the albatross around the neck of every england side since their solitary world cup win in 1966 but in recent campaigns , it seems that an extra penguin of hype has been chained to their ankles .
whenever england qualify for a major tournament , the nation 's collective memory is wiped clean by delusion and denial , sending the three lions off on a massive wave of -lrb- mostly unfounded -rrb- optimism .
whether fabio capello 's almost dictatorial control over every aspect of his team , including the messages given out by a salivating press corps , will ease the pressure on england in south africa remains to be seen .
nine qualifying wins out of ten suggest the dark days of the previous failing regime are long gone but question marks remain .
can england compete with the world 's best should they find themselves shorn of the talent of players like wayne rooney or steven gerrard ?
can the confidence crisis in the back four be resolved before the summer ?
does capello have a consistently reliable goalkeeper available ?
if the answers to all these turn out to be ' yes ' , then maybe … just maybe … author : nick amies editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is the conclusion of a new study published thursday in berlin by the oecd , the international organization of 30 free-market-based democratic countries .
the study found that children born of german parents have much better chances of finding work , even with the same high school qualifications .
16 oecd member states took part in the survey , which compared the careers of young people in a 20-29-year-old age bracket .
germany came second only to belgium in the list of most unfair western democracies .
the number of young people with no high school graduation or equivalent vocational qualification in germany is twice as high among immigrant families than it is among children with at least one german parent .
employer prejudices prevail but even those children of immigrant families with high school graduation have trouble finding work , according to the study .
90 percent of 20-29-year-old male high-school graduates with german parents have a job , compared with only 81 percent in an identical demographic , but with immigrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous pisa studies agree with the oecd oecd expert thomas liebig believes that this may show that german employers are still strongly prejudiced .
" one explanation could be that the job market is dominated by the expectation that immigrants and their children are less qualified , " he said .
children of immigrant parents have particular difficulty in finding work in public services .
only three percent of 20-29-year-old high school graduates of immigrant families are employed in public services , compared to 10 percent of those with german parents .
this is the biggest discrepancy in any of the countries surveyed .
the oecd showed unease at the statistics .
liebig said that the survey 's results were surprising , since high-school graduates of immigrant families had generally attained their qualifications in germany .
the oecd 's findings on the educational circumstances of immigrants in germany were similar to those of pisa studies. bk / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin is eager to reduce dependency on gas and oil imports , but environmentalists have already vowed to fight the decision . germany 's next center-right government of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- under chancellor angela merkel now says that the timetable of abandoning nuclear power by 2020 can not be kept .
already ahead of germany 's general election at the end of september , the two parties had pledged to extend the life of some of the country 's 17 nuclear power plants .
economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg on thursday confirmed that as coalition talks progress to form a new government , the two sides have agreed to accommodate that pledge and keep the nuclear plants running longer .
energy experts and economists from both parties argue that in order to keep other pledges to cut germany 's carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2020 and for reasons of energy security , the country has no choice but to extend the life of its nuclear power stations .
merkel herself has called nuclear power " an important bridge technology " on the way to cleaner and safer power for future generations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to see nuclear plants shut down nuclear power unpopular but vital nuclear power is highly unpopular in germany , with shipments of nuclear waste regularly triggering angry protests .
the country has no permanent storage site for the waste .
but germany is eager to reduce its dependence on volatile gas and oil imports from russia or the middle east and with only limited domestic resources , nuclear power is a strategically important energy source .
the new government plans , however , are vague , says fdp energy expert gudrun kopp , with details on which reactors will remain on line to be determined at a later date .
german media also report that merkel wants to delay concrete decisions on the nuclear issue until after a key state election in north rhine-westphalia next may , which could lose her party a majority in the upper house of parliament .
business and industry are very much in favor of the move , but environmentalists have vowed street protests , if merkel and the fdp go ahead with their plans. gb / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twenty years on , it now appears relatively untouched by the global downturn , and promises to be europe ’ s only economy to show positive growth this year . poland 's international airports are doing a bustling trade , thanks to the planeloads of polish holidaymakers booking charter flights to destinations such as the egyptian riviera , crete , morocco and thailand .
it seems that poles ' willingness to travel has n't been impacted by the financial tremors that have hit europe .
in fact , the polish middle class continues to spend like nobody 's business , and foreign travel is high on its list .
jacek dabrowski , financial director of the travel agency triada says that , until 2008 , the polish outbound tourist market grew by 40 percent each year , and this year 's results promise to be better than the european average .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's middle class does n't skimp on holidays " according to statistics from eurostat , the number of customers choosing foreign holidays is growing , " said dabrowski .
" organized outgoing travel in poland has great potential for growth .
the reason is the growing purchasing power of poles since eu accession , which means that poles are now choosing better hotels , more expensive destinations and generally spending more money abroad . "
but how do polish tour operators manage to keep their heads above water with competing large german travel companies treating poland as a lucrative market ?
according to dabrowski , the polish companies ' edge lies in their flexibility .
having to build up businesses from scratch and steer them through tough market transformations , polish entrepreneurs have learned to take risks and adapt quickly .
but it 's not just in the holiday market that evidence of economic success abounds in poland .
there 's the growing number of foreign direct investments , which last year alone totalled a cool $ 16 billion -lrb- 10.7 billion euros -rrb- .
increasingly , investors are looking for more than just cheap labor ; they 're setting up service and r & d centers , for example .
economic shock therapy " poland has become the only country in europe where consumers are spending more than they used to spend a year ago , and where corporations are spending more , " said slawomir majman , president of the polish information and foreign investment agency in warsaw .
" poland 's exports are growing .
and most importantly , poland is delivering the product which is definitely in short supply in 2009 : economic stability . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile factory in poland : the country has been protected from the financial crisis it all seems light years away from the autumn of 1989 , when it became clear that the outgoing communist regime had not only mismanaged poland 's economy on a shocking scale , but also run up billions of us dollars in foreign debt .
then , food queues , chronic shortages and rampant inflation earned poland the reputation of being the sick man of europe .
at the warsaw school of economics , professor leszek balcerowicz put together a " shock therapy " plan to invigorate the country 's economy .
he 's now known as the father of poland 's market reforms , but looking back , he admits that the challenges facing the country two decades ago were daunting .
" poland was burdened by the troubles of communism - huge waste , inefficiency , declining production , " said balcerowicz .
" in addition , there was huge foreign debt incurred in the 1970s , and a runaway inflation of 50 percent a month .
it was an economic catastrophe . "
balcerowicz 's bitter pill was a strict monetarist approach , coupled with fast-paced market reforms , which quickly put poland 's house in order .
even though polish governments have changed frequently since then , balcerowicz is happy that politicians have consistently kept the country 's finances in check , and made the most of poland 's natural advantage : its size .
new generation untouched by communism " we are a much larger economy than the baltics , or the czech republic , or slovakia , or hungary , " he said .
" as a result , we suffer less from external shocks .
until 2007 , monetary policy in poland was pretty conservative .
the rate of credit growth was not very rapid , so we did n't develop a housing bubble .
i 'm happy that , as a governor of the national bank of poland until 2007 , i managed to bring inflation down from around 10 to 2 percent . "
as a new academic year starts at balcerowicz 's school of economics in warsaw , this year 's 19-year-old freshmen are the first generation to have been born in a democratic poland .
never having known communism , their entire lives have been punctuated by the growth of poland 's market economy .
now that solid foundations have been laid , it will be their job to continue the process of catching up with the world 's most developed economies .

it also finds fault with the catholic leadership in germany for failing to take a consistent approach to the interpretation of church dogma .
on wednesday , a crisis meeting of the leaders of the two denominations resulted in apologies but also in the growing realization that the cracks between the two have only been papered over .
the meeting lasted more than two hours , and , according to the head of the german protestant church , wolfgang huber , succeeded in re-establishing a level of trust .
" the protestant church considers this paper a mistake , " huber said .
" we extend our apologies to all catholics who rightly feel personally insulted by what was written there . "
huber said the paper had not been authorized and had been compiled by a senior policy consultant in the protestant church leadership and leaked to the media .
the paper speaks of major tensions between the denominations since pope benedict came to power in 2005 .
it says this friction could be the result of either the vatican 's inability to conduct interfaith dialog or as an indication of a change in papal policy .
" worsening atmosphere " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huber said the paper was not authorized by the church the paper also compares the leader of the german catholic church , archbishop robert zollitsch , to a boxer reeling in the ring from the blows of his opponent .
zollitsch , it says , staggers between openness and the hard-line policy insisted upon by the vatican .
zollitsch himself dismissed the accusations but admitted that problems exist .
" this paper is full of cliches that do n't reflect the real situation , " zollitsch said after the meeting with huber .
" of course there are theological differences with the protestant church , but our meeting was n't about these problems .
it was about a worsening of the atmosphere between us which we hopefully will be able to improve . "
rudolf lill , an expert in vatican policy , said the rift is the result of policy pursued by pope benedict , who has shaped as a hard-line enforcer of church dogma rather than a religious reformer .
" in some aspects the author of the paper is quite right , " lill said .
" papal policy under benedict has been marked by a drive for absolute power , which in turn will limit the influence of the roman catholic church in contemporary society .
this year would appear to be a landmark year in this respect . "
as evidence of this , lill points to the pope 's recent decision to lift the excommunication of bishop richard williamson , the head of the ultra-traditionalist st pius brotherhood and a known holocaust denier .

a quarter of the population never picks up a book . book lovers feel absolutely at home in frankfurt 's westend neighborhood .
among all the century-old buildings - cafes , flower shops and designer stores - visitors can also find find authors ' bookstore .
established in 1979 by a group of writers , the shop has become an institution in a city famed for its huge international book fair . " we have a wide selection of books , but we focus on what we call ' a good book ' - of course , it 's always debatable what a good book really is , " store manager barbara determann mused .
" people have different opinions on that - and , a good book at three o 'clock in the morning is entirely different from what i 'd read at my desk at three o 'clock in the afternoon .
either way , we always tell our customers that good books are appreciated in our shop . "
but customers at the " authors ' bookstore " do not necessarily reflect the population at large .
reading habits vary largely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids who are read to often become readers later in life social scientists have been warning that younger generations are losing their interest in reading .
a 2008 study commissioned by stiftung lesen , germany 's foundation for the promotion of reading , showed that around one quarter of literate germans over the age of 14 never pick up a book .
at the other end of the scale , however , those same government statistics revealed that 36 percent of germans read at least once a week , while three percent can be classified as real bookworms - tearing through an average of one book per week .
stiftung lesen 's christoph schaefer said early childhood experiences play an important role .
" children end up becoming readers primarily when they are read to .
do germans read to their kids ?
unfortunately not , " he said .
" some 42 percent of parents with kids in the prime age for being read to - from babyhood to 10 years - do not do so , or only rarely . "
studies show that this number is also slowly , but surely , growing .
the 2008 stiftung lesen study , for example , revealed that 45 percent of the 14-to-19-year-olds surveyed had never received a book as a gift during their childhoods .
readers with refined tastes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many customers like book tips , store owners say still , in the frankfurt bookshop , determann said that those customers who do consider reading very important are demanding better material .
" the children 's and youth literature section is the fastest-growing in our shop , " she pointed out .
" a lot of young families live in this part of town - upwardly mobile , ambitious people with kids .
they like coming to our store because they 're educated and want their kids to be too .
they leave their kids here so that we can read to them and suggest books we think they 'd like . "
each year , 90,000 new books flood the german market , but the media trend is definitely leaning towards computer-based , or internet reading .
another 2008 study showed that 95 percent of boys between the ages of 12 and 19 prefer electronic media over books ; the number for girls is only slightly less .
but , the study also confirmed what people always say : the more parents read themselves , the more their children will .
as far as the market goes , customers prefer paperbacks over hardcovers , and thin books over thick ones .
also in great demand at the moment : non-fiction , specialized books and mysteries .
" mysteries are always popular , but there 's been a new trend : regional thrillers , " said schaefer .
" many readers have come to appreciate even little cities or towns as settings for crime stories - one can even say it 's a stable trend on the market . "
independent stores offer individual service schaefer said books for " all ages " represent the second big trend - books that are supposedly for kids , but are also widely read by adults .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-fiction and specialized books are a big trend on the german market " harry potter , for instance , opened up a whole range of possibilities , " schaefer said .
" although , if you think back to author michael ende , you realize j.k. rowling was not the first to tap that market . "
big bookstore chains have taken over most of the smaller bookshops in frankfurt .
determann said independent stores can only survive by offering a high standard of service .
" we like to recommend books - because the market is so massive and so hard to keep track of , and there is so much junk out there , " she said .
" we work our way through the mountains of books and are then able to select what we think are the best - exciting books , contemporary ones , or even translations of older books that are being discussed again .
we want to offer all that in our shop . "
over 20 percent of book purchases are now conducted online , and market analysts say that number will only increase .
but , luckily for the authors ' bookstore , there 's also a growing group of die-hard buyers who want personal book recommendations from staff like barbara determann , who know their literary tastes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 15.10.2009 crisis-ridden romania gets finance whizz as prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president basescu nominated a new prime minister thursday romanian president traian basescu nominated central bank adviser and former imf representative lucian croitoru as prime minister on thursday , following a collapse of the government earlier this week in parliament . following the collapse of emil boc 's centre-right government in a no-confidence vote , economics expert lucian croitoru became romania 's new prime minister on thursday .
he now has ten days to form a government and secure the approval of parliament .
the appointment is the latest stage in an ongoing political and economic crisis in romania .
the most recent phase began on tuesday , when boc 's democrat liberal party -lrb- pd-l -rrb- failed a parliamentary confidence vote , gaining less than 35 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emil boc was ousted by a no-confidence vote this week president basescu also announced thursday that the international monetary fund has postponed a mission to bucharest to review progress under its 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 29.5 billion -rrb- aid accord until after a new government is found .
this intensified concerns that romania would not be able to meet the imf 's conditions for badly needed new loans .
a cool head in a financial crisis president basescu stressed that croitoru was " independent " and well known for his " competence in economic matters " both at a national and an international level .
croitoru is said to be close to the president but not affiliated with any party .
he worked for the romanian central bank for 11 years , and was a member of the team of experts who negotiated the imf-led aid agreement earlier this year , a deal designed to rescue romania 's struggling economy from painful recession .
croitoru also warned that the government budget deficit may top imf-backed targets because of pressures stemming from upcoming presidential elections .
his appointment could help persuade the fund to send a new chunk of the loans as part of its bailout .
on wednesday , basescu had warned , " if we fail to obtain the two tranches of loans , including that due between october and december , we risk finding it impossible to pay salaries and pensions . "
basescu urged the opposition to support his nomination .
" the deepening political crisis is beginning to have economic effects , " he said .
" i call on all parties to understand that romania urgently needs an effective government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania has been in economic freefall this year opposition parties have own ideas but despite basescu 's pleas to recalcitrant opposition parties , romania 's political crisis looks likely to continue as three of them , the social democrats -lrb- psd -rrb- , the liberals -lrb- pnl -rrb- and the ethnic hungarian umd party had put forward their own candidate for the job : sibiu mayor klaus iohannis .
iohannis was elected last year for a third term as the mayor of sibiu , europe 's cultural capital in 2007 .
he is credited with turning the city into one of romania 's most popular tourist destinations thanks to the extensive renovation of its old centre .

the controversial block on child porn websites will be lifted and new rules will affect police powers .
there are new breakthroughs in the ongoing coalition negotiations in the new german government ahead of decisive talks scheduled this weekend .
negotiators for both parties announced agreements in the areas of internal security that suggested that the fdp 's libertarian agenda is forcing concessions from the conservative cdu .
on the question of website blocks , an initiative introduced by cdu family minister ursula van der leyen earlier this year to combat child pornography , the two parties agreed to try to delete rather than block offending websites .
in a year 's time , the success of the deletion policy will be assessed .
police powers curbed important agreements are designed to curtail police powers : cdu interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced that the use of stored private data in police investigations would be limited to extremely dangerous situations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child porn sites are to be deleted rather than blocked the police will also have to apply to the federal public prosecutor to conduct secret online searches of computers , rather than local district courts .
the power to conduct online searches will not be extended to other security authorities like the secret service .
the free liberals could also record some success in the question of the protection of professional secrets .
under the new government agenda , all lawyers , not only criminal defense lawyers , will be allowed to withhold sensitive information from the police on professional grounds .
an official enquiry will be initiated to decide whether a similar rule can cover journalists .
prison sentences extended in addition , the two parties agreed that the maximum prison sentence for murder in the case of young criminals would be extended from 10 to 15 years .
a so-called " warning-shot-detention " of up to four weeks will also be introduced for young criminals placed on probation .
fdp domestic policy spokesman max stadler declared that he had expected the cdu bow to the fdp 's demands on certain issues .
" after all , we were elected to bring in changes and improvements , " he told reporters. bk / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the solar industry , however , is warning against taking drastic steps . in coalition talks , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have discussed drastically slashing renewable energy subsidies as the industry becomes more efficient .
" where it makes sense , we may have to make cuts , " energy expert michael fuchs told reporters earlier this week , " for example where technology has led to a reduction in price , as with solar energy , " cdu energy expert joachim pfeiffer said the subsidies for solar power will be reassessed in 2010 .
this is a schedule both the economic and the environmental committees of the upcoming coalition could agree on . costs for solar plants have dropped according to holger krawinkel , an energy expert at the federation of german consumer organizations , cuts are necessary for compensation for selling solar power back to the public grid . " if costs for solar plants drop by 30 percent , then it 's not quite logical why the compensation should n't be proportionately reduced , " he said .
" our demands have been met : the plants have gotten cheaper ; the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- planned a reduction anyway . " carsten koernig , executive director of the german solar industry association , said subsidies to the industry are cut by 10 percent each year as it is .
this was appropriate , considering that the industry had been able to cut its costs by 50 percent since 2000 , he added . " now the question is : are there even bigger margins ?
we warn against large-scale changes , " said koernig , who conceded that the new government may want to assess the need for change , considering the recent cost cuts . large-scale reductions , however , could have a negative impact on customers ' willingness to make the initial investment in solar panels , should the compensation for selling back to the grid be slashed too drastrically . however , koernig said he suspects another motive : " we all know that -lsb- the german government -rsb- mainly want to implement longer runs for nuclear power facilities . " bildunterschrift : the solar industry has drastically reduced the cost of panels in recent years selling energy to the public grid solar energy customers who have installed solar cells at home and feed energy into the public grid are now getting paid a hefty 43 cents -lrb- $ 0.64 -rrb- per kilowatt hour as an incentive to purchase the initial solar set-up . the costs of subsidies is passed on to all electricity consumers , said koernig . " this leads to an increase of the electricity tariff by 0.5 percent , " he added .
in comparison , the energy wasted by leaving electronic devices in stand-by mode adds up to 10 percent of an average customer 's bill . some are claiming this amount is too high .
according to krawinkel , the subsidy should drop proportionally .
" do i need a return of 15 or 20 percent -lsb- for solar energy sold back to the grid -rsb- , or should n't three , four , five percent do the job of an incentive for this innovation ?

" ausgestrahlt " reported on wednesday that only 10 percent of that was returned to germany as enriched uranium .
the anti-nuclear activists said the remaining 90 percent was stored in siberia , outdoors and in rusting containers .
uranium hexafluoride is highly toxic and corrosive to most metals .
urenco , the uranium-processing firm that runs the gronau enrichment facility , confirmed that it has shipped more than 27,000 tons of depleted uranium to russia 's state-run firm tenex since 1996 .
about 10 to 15 percent of the material was treated and returned to germany .
urenco says it has meanwhile terminated cooperation with the russian company . government accused of " nuclear waste tourism " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have protested against toxic waste shipments from germany following an inquiry by the left party , the government had already publicly acknowledged the exports in 2007 .
juergen maass , a spokesman for the environment ministry in berlin , on wednesday confirmed the shipments of depleted uranium to russia .
he emphasized that the shipments , although they did contain nuclear waste , were not illegal .
the federal office for radiation protection has said the exports were not subject to approval under the atomic energy act .
opposition parties have renewed criticism of the german government 's policy of exporting nuclear waste .
eva bulling-schroeter , environmental spokeswoman for the left party , called for an end to such shipments : " it is time the government stopped trivializing nuclear waste tourism . "
permanent storage of nuclear waste is not only an unsolved problem and a controversial issue in germany , as it does elsewhere in europe .
in france this week , an arte television documentary and the newspaper liberation said that more than 100 tons of depleted uranium from french power plants have been stored in an open-air complex in siberia .
furthermore , according to an italian environmental organization , at least two dozen ships containing radioactive waste have been sunk in the ionion sea off southern italy in order to bypass local laws. db / ap / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
