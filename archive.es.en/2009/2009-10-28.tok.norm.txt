but now their future as allies appears to be in doubt as turkey sparks a series of diplomatic rows . the latest chapter in increasingly ugly relations between turkey and israel - once close allies - centers around a turkish tv series .
israeli soldiers are shown murdering palestinian children .
one of them smiles at a soldier , but he shoots her in cold blood .
the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .
" given the current state of relations , it is difficult to describe it as a strategic relationship anymore .
it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have broadly condemned israel 's attacks against the gaza strip turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly condemned israel 's treatment of palestinians , even accusing the israelis of using weapons of mass destruction against gaza .
but the tough stance is causing concern among turkey 's allies , both in europe and in the us .
us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .
" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .
" the terror in this region is created by hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza !
where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "
syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

but now their future as allies appears to be in doubt as turkey sparks a series of diplomatic rows . the latest chapter in increasingly ugly relations between turkey and israel - once close allies - centers around a turkish tv series .
israeli soldiers are shown murdering palestinian children .
one of them smiles at a soldier , but he shoots her in cold blood .
the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .
" given the current state of relations , it is difficult to describe it as a strategic relationship anymore .
it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have broadly condemned israel 's attacks against the gaza strip turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly condemned israel 's treatment of palestinians , even accusing the israelis of using weapons of mass destruction against gaza .
but the tough stance is causing concern among turkey 's allies , both in europe and in the us .
us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .
" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .
" the terror in this region is created by hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza !
where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "
syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .
" the terror in this region is created by hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza !
where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "
syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

but now their future as allies appears to be in doubt as turkey sparks a series of diplomatic rows . the latest chapter in increasingly ugly relations between turkey and israel - once close allies - centers around a turkish tv series .
israeli soldiers are shown murdering palestinian children .
one of them smiles at a soldier , but he shoots her in cold blood .
the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .
" given the current state of relations , it is difficult to describe it as a strategic relationship anymore .
it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have broadly condemned israel 's attacks against the gaza strip turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly condemned israel 's treatment of palestinians , even accusing the israelis of using weapons of mass destruction against gaza .
but the tough stance is causing concern among turkey 's allies , both in europe and in the us .
us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .
" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 28.10.2009 village school teaches chinese and tibetan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often tibetans are at an economic disadvantage because they do not learn chinese at an early age compared to the chinese , many tibetans are still at an economic disadvantage .
this is often because they speak tibetan rather than chinese .
on the other hand , tibetans sometimes complain that their culture is being forgotten and that tibetans are becoming more and more chinese .
however , there are positive counter-examples - in qinghai for example , where the dalai lama is from .
a lot of tibetans still live there today and one village is making sure children are educated in both languages . gelek is usually woken by the dog at about 6 am .
the seven-year-old lives in a mud hut near a meadow where yaks graze .
before setting off for school , he drinks a salty , buttery tea that his mother has prepared and eats some homemade bread .
to get to school , gelek has to cross fields with grazing yaks and pass mud huts where buddhist prayer flags flutter in the wind .
he lives in the mountainous province of qinghai , which neighbours tibet .
100 pupils in a 1960s building gelek gets to school at 8.20 am .
the 1960s building is four storeys high .
the teacher ning says that there are more than 100 pupils .
“ about half of the families here can be described as poor , ” ning explains .
“ in the cities , children have computer courses from the first or second form onwards and they also learn how to play the piano or another instrument .
but we can not offer that to our children here . ”
but until recently the biggest problem was not poverty but language .
almost all the children speak fluent tibetan but not one word of chinese , says duan zhi who is himself tibetan .
the 28-year-old works for an ngo that wants to improve living conditions for tibetan children .
“ the children are growing up in a purely tibetan environment .
but suddenly when they start going to school , they find themselves among chinese people .
the children don ’ t understand a word and that ’ s why they fall behind with their work .
the villagers complained to the local authorities , ” recalls duan zhi .
model bilingual school project their complaints did not fall on deaf ears .
the small village school has become a model project .
not only chinese teachers are employed but tibetan ones as well .
the pupils are taught in both languages .
the teacher , ning , says this will be an advantage in future .
he knows that he only got the job because he speaks both languages .
“ the children know that they are behind compared to those in the cities .
they see what children in the cities can do on television , the chances that they have .
they know many tibetans don ’ t get jobs later .
if they only speak tibetan it ’ s hard for them in china . ”
the break is over .
gelek is concentrating on the blackboard : “ i like tibetan .
our script is so beautiful ; i like to read in tibetan , ” he says .
but although he finds it hard gelek also wants to learn chinese because he knows it ’ s a way out of poverty .
his dream is to speak both languages well and to become a teacher .
his well-educated tibetan teacher ning is his idol .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 28.10.2009 germany 's wage gap also a regional issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern germany find it easier to combine kids with a career the wage gap between men and women is much lower in eastern germany than in the western states , research suggests , citing better availability of day care in the east as the most decisive factor . according to research conducted by the cologne-based german economic institute -lrb- iwd -rrb- , women in eastern germany earn almost as much as their male colleagues , with a wage gap of six percent .
in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .
the idea is to find a large audience for poems that typically would only be read by a few people . " it 's a really good feeling to get responses , " said bleutge , " sometimes in person , sometimes by email .
most people do n't just read the poem , they also listen to it , so there 's a greater sense of closeness between us authors and the readers . " lange said she often listens to poems read in languages that she can not understand . " it 's like a concert , " she said .
" i can only recommend taking a break from the daily grind and letting this kind of word music have an effect on you . " author : oliver kranz -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .

but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .
the idea is to find a large audience for poems that typically would only be read by a few people . " it 's a really good feeling to get responses , " said bleutge , " sometimes in person , sometimes by email .
most people do n't just read the poem , they also listen to it , so there 's a greater sense of closeness between us authors and the readers . " lange said she often listens to poems read in languages that she can not understand . " it 's like a concert , " she said .

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .

this is often because they speak tibetan rather than chinese .
on the other hand , tibetans sometimes complain that their culture is being forgotten and that tibetans are becoming more and more chinese .
however , there are positive counter-examples - in qinghai for example , where the dalai lama is from .
a lot of tibetans still live there today and one village is making sure children are educated in both languages . gelek is usually woken by the dog at about 6 am .
the seven-year-old lives in a mud hut near a meadow where yaks graze .
before setting off for school , he drinks a salty , buttery tea that his mother has prepared and eats some homemade bread .
to get to school , gelek has to cross fields with grazing yaks and pass mud huts where buddhist prayer flags flutter in the wind .
he lives in the mountainous province of qinghai , which neighbours tibet .
100 pupils in a 1960s building gelek gets to school at 8.20 am .
the 1960s building is four storeys high .
the teacher ning says that there are more than 100 pupils .
“ about half of the families here can be described as poor , ” ning explains .
“ in the cities , children have computer courses from the first or second form onwards and they also learn how to play the piano or another instrument .
but we can not offer that to our children here . ”
but until recently the biggest problem was not poverty but language .
almost all the children speak fluent tibetan but not one word of chinese , says duan zhi who is himself tibetan .
the 28-year-old works for an ngo that wants to improve living conditions for tibetan children .
“ the children are growing up in a purely tibetan environment .
but suddenly when they start going to school , they find themselves among chinese people .
the children don ’ t understand a word and that ’ s why they fall behind with their work .
the villagers complained to the local authorities , ” recalls duan zhi .
model bilingual school project their complaints did not fall on deaf ears .
the small village school has become a model project .
not only chinese teachers are employed but tibetan ones as well .
the pupils are taught in both languages .
the teacher , ning , says this will be an advantage in future .
he knows that he only got the job because he speaks both languages .
“ the children know that they are behind compared to those in the cities .
they see what children in the cities can do on television , the chances that they have .
they know many tibetans don ’ t get jobs later .
if they only speak tibetan it ’ s hard for them in china . ”
the break is over .
gelek is concentrating on the blackboard : “ i like tibetan .
our script is so beautiful ; i like to read in tibetan , ” he says .
but although he finds it hard gelek also wants to learn chinese because he knows it ’ s a way out of poverty .
his dream is to speak both languages well and to become a teacher .
his well-educated tibetan teacher ning is his idol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.10.2009 which way will turkey turn , east or west ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the geographic bridge between europe and asia turkey makes no bones about its aspirations to act as a bridge between east and west , but a string of recent events have left the west wondering how stable any such construction might be . the problems began earlier this year when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan stormed out of a panel discussion in davos over the israeli offensive in gaza .
since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.10.2009 eu tells car industry to stop selling inefficent vehicles or face fines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu fears its car industry will miss the opportunity to lead the world in innovation europe 's car industry has been told to stop selling its most inefficient vehicles by 2016 , or face hefty fines .
but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.10.2009 which way will turkey turn , east or west ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the geographic bridge between europe and asia turkey makes no bones about its aspirations to act as a bridge between east and west , but a string of recent events have left the west wondering how stable any such construction might be . the problems began earlier this year when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan stormed out of a panel discussion in davos over the israeli offensive in gaza .
since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

but now their future as allies appears to be in doubt as turkey sparks a series of diplomatic rows . the latest chapter in increasingly ugly relations between turkey and israel - once close allies - centers around a turkish tv series .
israeli soldiers are shown murdering palestinian children .
one of them smiles at a soldier , but he shoots her in cold blood .
the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .
" given the current state of relations , it is difficult to describe it as a strategic relationship anymore .
it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have broadly condemned israel 's attacks against the gaza strip turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly condemned israel 's treatment of palestinians , even accusing the israelis of using weapons of mass destruction against gaza .

us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .

syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

but now their future as allies appears to be in doubt as turkey sparks a series of diplomatic rows . the latest chapter in increasingly ugly relations between turkey and israel - once close allies - centers around a turkish tv series .
israeli soldiers are shown murdering palestinian children .
one of them smiles at a soldier , but he shoots her in cold blood .
the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .
" given the current state of relations , it is difficult to describe it as a strategic relationship anymore .
it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have broadly condemned israel 's attacks against the gaza strip turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly condemned israel 's treatment of palestinians , even accusing the israelis of using weapons of mass destruction against gaza .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.10.2009 which way will turkey turn , east or west ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the geographic bridge between europe and asia turkey makes no bones about its aspirations to act as a bridge between east and west , but a string of recent events have left the west wondering how stable any such construction might be . the problems began earlier this year when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan stormed out of a panel discussion in davos over the israeli offensive in gaza .
since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 28.10.2009 sea patrols and recession discourage illegal immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontex has stepped up its sea patrols to prevent illegal immigration the european union 's external border security agency frontex says its sea patrols have successfully reduced illegal immigration into europe .
but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .
about 2,280 migrants have reached the canaries so far this year , while 2,360 have been stopped in or off africa .
only two migrant boats had set off from senegal over the past nine months , while nearly 8,000 migrants landed in the islands in 2008 .
frontex has been operating since october 2005 , and patrols 42,000 kilometers -lrb- 26,000 miles -rrb- of the eu 's sea borders and 8,800 kilometers of land frontier. bk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .
the idea is to find a large audience for poems that typically would only be read by a few people . " it 's a really good feeling to get responses , " said bleutge , " sometimes in person , sometimes by email .
most people do n't just read the poem , they also listen to it , so there 's a greater sense of closeness between us authors and the readers . " lange said she often listens to poems read in languages that she can not understand . " it 's like a concert , " she said .

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.10.2009 eu tells car industry to stop selling inefficent vehicles or face fines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu fears its car industry will miss the opportunity to lead the world in innovation europe 's car industry has been told to stop selling its most inefficient vehicles by 2016 , or face hefty fines .
but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

" that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .
the idea is to find a large audience for poems that typically would only be read by a few people . " it 's a really good feeling to get responses , " said bleutge , " sometimes in person , sometimes by email .
most people do n't just read the poem , they also listen to it , so there 's a greater sense of closeness between us authors and the readers . " lange said she often listens to poems read in languages that she can not understand . " it 's like a concert , " she said .
" i can only recommend taking a break from the daily grind and letting this kind of word music have an effect on you . " author : oliver kranz -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .
about 2,280 migrants have reached the canaries so far this year , while 2,360 have been stopped in or off africa .
only two migrant boats had set off from senegal over the past nine months , while nearly 8,000 migrants landed in the islands in 2008 .
frontex has been operating since october 2005 , and patrols 42,000 kilometers -lrb- 26,000 miles -rrb- of the eu 's sea borders and 8,800 kilometers of land frontier. bk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .

guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.10.2009 turkey 's relationship with israel in doubt after diplomatic rows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has been distancing itself from israel , once a key ally in the region for more than a decade , turkey and israel have enjoyed a strategic relationship .
but now their future as allies appears to be in doubt as turkey sparks a series of diplomatic rows . the latest chapter in increasingly ugly relations between turkey and israel - once close allies - centers around a turkish tv series .
israeli soldiers are shown murdering palestinian children .
one of them smiles at a soldier , but he shoots her in cold blood .
the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .
" given the current state of relations , it is difficult to describe it as a strategic relationship anymore .
it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .

analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .

with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.10.2009 eu tells car industry to stop selling inefficent vehicles or face fines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu fears its car industry will miss the opportunity to lead the world in innovation europe 's car industry has been told to stop selling its most inefficient vehicles by 2016 , or face hefty fines .
but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.10.2009 which way will turkey turn , east or west ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the geographic bridge between europe and asia turkey makes no bones about its aspirations to act as a bridge between east and west , but a string of recent events have left the west wondering how stable any such construction might be . the problems began earlier this year when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan stormed out of a panel discussion in davos over the israeli offensive in gaza .
since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .

where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "
syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .

" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 28.10.2009 poetry web site offers " word music " in audio form großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poetry is more than the written word a poem is a collection of letters whose sum is more than words - but also a kind of music .
a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .
the idea is to find a large audience for poems that typically would only be read by a few people . " it 's a really good feeling to get responses , " said bleutge , " sometimes in person , sometimes by email .

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 28.10.2009 germany 's wage gap also a regional issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern germany find it easier to combine kids with a career the wage gap between men and women is much lower in eastern germany than in the western states , research suggests , citing better availability of day care in the east as the most decisive factor . according to research conducted by the cologne-based german economic institute -lrb- iwd -rrb- , women in eastern germany earn almost as much as their male colleagues , with a wage gap of six percent .
in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .
about 2,280 migrants have reached the canaries so far this year , while 2,360 have been stopped in or off africa .
only two migrant boats had set off from senegal over the past nine months , while nearly 8,000 migrants landed in the islands in 2008 .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .

but now their future as allies appears to be in doubt as turkey sparks a series of diplomatic rows . the latest chapter in increasingly ugly relations between turkey and israel - once close allies - centers around a turkish tv series .
israeli soldiers are shown murdering palestinian children .
one of them smiles at a soldier , but he shoots her in cold blood .
the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .
" given the current state of relations , it is difficult to describe it as a strategic relationship anymore .
it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have broadly condemned israel 's attacks against the gaza strip turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly condemned israel 's treatment of palestinians , even accusing the israelis of using weapons of mass destruction against gaza .
but the tough stance is causing concern among turkey 's allies , both in europe and in the us .
us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .
" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .
" the terror in this region is created by hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza !
where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "
syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .

but the tough stance is causing concern among turkey 's allies , both in europe and in the us .
us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .
" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .
" the terror in this region is created by hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza !
where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "
syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .
" given the current state of relations , it is difficult to describe it as a strategic relationship anymore .
it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have broadly condemned israel 's attacks against the gaza strip turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly condemned israel 's treatment of palestinians , even accusing the israelis of using weapons of mass destruction against gaza .
but the tough stance is causing concern among turkey 's allies , both in europe and in the us .
us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .
" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .
" the terror in this region is created by hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza !
where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "
syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .

guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .

but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .
about 2,280 migrants have reached the canaries so far this year , while 2,360 have been stopped in or off africa .
only two migrant boats had set off from senegal over the past nine months , while nearly 8,000 migrants landed in the islands in 2008 .

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .
the idea is to find a large audience for poems that typically would only be read by a few people . " it 's a really good feeling to get responses , " said bleutge , " sometimes in person , sometimes by email .
most people do n't just read the poem , they also listen to it , so there 's a greater sense of closeness between us authors and the readers . " lange said she often listens to poems read in languages that she can not understand . " it 's like a concert , " she said .

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .
the idea is to find a large audience for poems that typically would only be read by a few people . " it 's a really good feeling to get responses , " said bleutge , " sometimes in person , sometimes by email .
most people do n't just read the poem , they also listen to it , so there 's a greater sense of closeness between us authors and the readers . " lange said she often listens to poems read in languages that she can not understand . " it 's like a concert , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 28.10.2009 germany 's wage gap also a regional issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern germany find it easier to combine kids with a career the wage gap between men and women is much lower in eastern germany than in the western states , research suggests , citing better availability of day care in the east as the most decisive factor . according to research conducted by the cologne-based german economic institute -lrb- iwd -rrb- , women in eastern germany earn almost as much as their male colleagues , with a wage gap of six percent .
in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .

the taliban have taken responsibility , saying it is the start of a campaign against the presidential run-off . twelve people were killed after an explosion rocked a guesthouse in central kabul used by the united nations and armed militants stormed in .
un spokesman adrian edwards confirmed to the afp news agency that among the dead were six international un staff .
he was unable to confirm the nationalities of those killed .
two afghan security officers were also killed along with three attackers .
the 12th fatality was a civilian hit by a bullet while watching the battle from the second floor of his house .
afghan forces exchanged gunfire for an hour and a half with militants inside the bekhtar guesthouse , which was attacked at around 6:30 a.m. by three armed gunmen wearing vests packed with explosives .
according to afghan interior ministry spokesman zemarai bashery , the attackers were shot dead during the police operation .
the taliban had warned over the weekend that it would target all afghans and foreigners working on the november 7th run-off election between president hamid karzai and his challenger , abdullah abdullah , who finished second in the august polls .
the taliban has vowed to continue attacks in the run-up to the vote .
karzai on wednesday ordered an immediate and urgent upgrade to security for international organizations .
" the president instructed security agencies to reinforce security at foreign installations for better protection against such incidents , " a statement from the president 's office said .
hotel under fire kabul 's luxury serena hotel , near the presidential palace , was also the scene of explosions , even as the guesthouse was still under siege .
rockets were fired at the building , landing in its gardens , according to witnesses and security sources .

the violence comes in the month that has proven the deadliest for us forces in afghanistan , which make up two-thirds of the troops in there .
eight us soldiers were killed in southern afghanistan on tuesday , according to nato , which pushed the october death toll to 53 .
the attacks on soldiers and civilians comes as us president barack obama weighs whether to send more soldiers to the country to fight the growing insurgency .
the commander of us and nato forces in afghanistan , general stanley mcchrystal , has asked for 40,000 more troops to carry out a counter-insurgency campaign .
if he does not get a substantial infusion of troops , he has said , the afghan mission could fail. jam / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .

but the tough stance is causing concern among turkey 's allies , both in europe and in the us .
us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .
" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .
" the terror in this region is created by hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza !
where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "

damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .

it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .

but the tough stance is causing concern among turkey 's allies , both in europe and in the us .
us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .
" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .
" the terror in this region is created by hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza !
where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "
syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

but now their future as allies appears to be in doubt as turkey sparks a series of diplomatic rows . the latest chapter in increasingly ugly relations between turkey and israel - once close allies - centers around a turkish tv series .
israeli soldiers are shown murdering palestinian children .
one of them smiles at a soldier , but he shoots her in cold blood .
the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .
" given the current state of relations , it is difficult to describe it as a strategic relationship anymore .
it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have broadly condemned israel 's attacks against the gaza strip turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly condemned israel 's treatment of palestinians , even accusing the israelis of using weapons of mass destruction against gaza .
but the tough stance is causing concern among turkey 's allies , both in europe and in the us .
us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .
" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .
" the terror in this region is created by hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza !
where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "
syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 28.10.2009 germany 's wage gap also a regional issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern germany find it easier to combine kids with a career the wage gap between men and women is much lower in eastern germany than in the western states , research suggests , citing better availability of day care in the east as the most decisive factor . according to research conducted by the cologne-based german economic institute -lrb- iwd -rrb- , women in eastern germany earn almost as much as their male colleagues , with a wage gap of six percent .
in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

the taliban have taken responsibility , saying it is the start of a campaign against the presidential run-off . twelve people were killed after an explosion rocked a guesthouse in central kabul used by the united nations and armed militants stormed in .
un spokesman adrian edwards confirmed to the afp news agency that among the dead were six international un staff .
he was unable to confirm the nationalities of those killed .
two afghan security officers were also killed along with three attackers .
the 12th fatality was a civilian hit by a bullet while watching the battle from the second floor of his house .
afghan forces exchanged gunfire for an hour and a half with militants inside the bekhtar guesthouse , which was attacked at around 6:30 a.m. by three armed gunmen wearing vests packed with explosives .
according to afghan interior ministry spokesman zemarai bashery , the attackers were shot dead during the police operation .
the taliban had warned over the weekend that it would target all afghans and foreigners working on the november 7th run-off election between president hamid karzai and his challenger , abdullah abdullah , who finished second in the august polls .
the taliban has vowed to continue attacks in the run-up to the vote .
karzai on wednesday ordered an immediate and urgent upgrade to security for international organizations .
" the president instructed security agencies to reinforce security at foreign installations for better protection against such incidents , " a statement from the president 's office said .
hotel under fire kabul 's luxury serena hotel , near the presidential palace , was also the scene of explosions , even as the guesthouse was still under siege .
rockets were fired at the building , landing in its gardens , according to witnesses and security sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai has ordered an immediate security upgrade a foreigner staying at the hotel told the reuters news agency that more than 100 people were rushed to an underground bunker following the attack .
no casualties have been reported from that attack .
the violence comes in the month that has proven the deadliest for us forces in afghanistan , which make up two-thirds of the troops in there .
eight us soldiers were killed in southern afghanistan on tuesday , according to nato , which pushed the october death toll to 53 .
the attacks on soldiers and civilians comes as us president barack obama weighs whether to send more soldiers to the country to fight the growing insurgency .
the commander of us and nato forces in afghanistan , general stanley mcchrystal , has asked for 40,000 more troops to carry out a counter-insurgency campaign .
if he does not get a substantial infusion of troops , he has said , the afghan mission could fail. jam / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 28.10.2009 germany 's wage gap also a regional issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern germany find it easier to combine kids with a career the wage gap between men and women is much lower in eastern germany than in the western states , research suggests , citing better availability of day care in the east as the most decisive factor . according to research conducted by the cologne-based german economic institute -lrb- iwd -rrb- , women in eastern germany earn almost as much as their male colleagues , with a wage gap of six percent .
in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .

analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .

" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.10.2009 which way will turkey turn , east or west ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the geographic bridge between europe and asia turkey makes no bones about its aspirations to act as a bridge between east and west , but a string of recent events have left the west wondering how stable any such construction might be . the problems began earlier this year when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan stormed out of a panel discussion in davos over the israeli offensive in gaza .
since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.10.2009 which way will turkey turn , east or west ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the geographic bridge between europe and asia turkey makes no bones about its aspirations to act as a bridge between east and west , but a string of recent events have left the west wondering how stable any such construction might be . the problems began earlier this year when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan stormed out of a panel discussion in davos over the israeli offensive in gaza .
since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .
about 2,280 migrants have reached the canaries so far this year , while 2,360 have been stopped in or off africa .
only two migrant boats had set off from senegal over the past nine months , while nearly 8,000 migrants landed in the islands in 2008 .
frontex has been operating since october 2005 , and patrols 42,000 kilometers -lrb- 26,000 miles -rrb- of the eu 's sea borders and 8,800 kilometers of land frontier. bk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .
about 2,280 migrants have reached the canaries so far this year , while 2,360 have been stopped in or off africa .
only two migrant boats had set off from senegal over the past nine months , while nearly 8,000 migrants landed in the islands in 2008 .
frontex has been operating since october 2005 , and patrols 42,000 kilometers -lrb- 26,000 miles -rrb- of the eu 's sea borders and 8,800 kilometers of land frontier. bk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.10.2009 which way will turkey turn , east or west ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the geographic bridge between europe and asia turkey makes no bones about its aspirations to act as a bridge between east and west , but a string of recent events have left the west wondering how stable any such construction might be . the problems began earlier this year when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan stormed out of a panel discussion in davos over the israeli offensive in gaza .
since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

" the new government will take another look at decisions made up to now on opel and imminent conditions to be set by the european commission , " trust member dirk pfeil told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " the result could be a solution where opel stays completely within the general motors group , " added pfeil , who is a member of the free democrats - the party that has joined forces with chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats to form germany 's new coalition government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk pfeil said berlin could save taxpayers ' money if general motors holds onto opel pfeil has repeatedly voiced objections to the sale of general motors ' european unit to magna and abstained from backing it when the trust voted on the deal last month . he argued that supporting opel 's survival with gm as its owner would only require berlin to provide between 2.5 billion euros and 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion and $ 4.4 billion -rrb- of taxpayer-funded aid - much less than the 4.5 billion euros magna had negotiated for its takeover bid . further delays general motors ' board of directors is due to meet on november 3 to reconsider the deal after regulators in brussels expressed concerns about the fairness of the german government 's involvement in the bidding process . the european commission has been watching the deal closely to ensure state aid is not misused for political purposes .
magna had won approval from berlin - germany is home to around half of opel 's 50,000 workers - by proposing to keep all four opel plants in germany open .
european antitrust officials question whether the deal to keep german factories open came at the expense of workers in other eu nations .
an antitrust ruling is expected by november 27 . meanwhile , the euroda opel dealers ' association has said it hopes the sale of opel to magna will be completed as soon as possible . " waiting much longer might hurt confidence in the future we so eagerly want to focus on , " euroda chairman jaap timmer wrote to gm chief executive fritz henderson in a letter obtained by the dpa-afx financial news agency . sje / reuters / afp / dpa editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .
the idea is to find a large audience for poems that typically would only be read by a few people . " it 's a really good feeling to get responses , " said bleutge , " sometimes in person , sometimes by email .
most people do n't just read the poem , they also listen to it , so there 's a greater sense of closeness between us authors and the readers . " lange said she often listens to poems read in languages that she can not understand . " it 's like a concert , " she said .

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .
the idea is to find a large audience for poems that typically would only be read by a few people . " it 's a really good feeling to get responses , " said bleutge , " sometimes in person , sometimes by email .
most people do n't just read the poem , they also listen to it , so there 's a greater sense of closeness between us authors and the readers . " lange said she often listens to poems read in languages that she can not understand . " it 's like a concert , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.10.2009 which way will turkey turn , east or west ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is the geographic bridge between europe and asia turkey makes no bones about its aspirations to act as a bridge between east and west , but a string of recent events have left the west wondering how stable any such construction might be . the problems began earlier this year when turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan stormed out of a panel discussion in davos over the israeli offensive in gaza .
since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

the taliban have taken responsibility , saying it is the start of a campaign against the presidential run-off . twelve people were killed after an explosion rocked a guesthouse in central kabul used by the united nations and armed militants stormed in .
un spokesman adrian edwards confirmed to the afp news agency that among the dead were six international un staff .
he was unable to confirm the nationalities of those killed .
two afghan security officers were also killed along with three attackers .
the 12th fatality was a civilian hit by a bullet while watching the battle from the second floor of his house .
afghan forces exchanged gunfire for an hour and a half with militants inside the bekhtar guesthouse , which was attacked at around 6:30 a.m. by three armed gunmen wearing vests packed with explosives .
according to afghan interior ministry spokesman zemarai bashery , the attackers were shot dead during the police operation .
the taliban had warned over the weekend that it would target all afghans and foreigners working on the november 7th run-off election between president hamid karzai and his challenger , abdullah abdullah , who finished second in the august polls .
the taliban has vowed to continue attacks in the run-up to the vote .
karzai on wednesday ordered an immediate and urgent upgrade to security for international organizations .
" the president instructed security agencies to reinforce security at foreign installations for better protection against such incidents , " a statement from the president 's office said .
hotel under fire kabul 's luxury serena hotel , near the presidential palace , was also the scene of explosions , even as the guesthouse was still under siege .
rockets were fired at the building , landing in its gardens , according to witnesses and security sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hamid karzai has ordered an immediate security upgrade a foreigner staying at the hotel told the reuters news agency that more than 100 people were rushed to an underground bunker following the attack .
no casualties have been reported from that attack .
the violence comes in the month that has proven the deadliest for us forces in afghanistan , which make up two-thirds of the troops in there .
eight us soldiers were killed in southern afghanistan on tuesday , according to nato , which pushed the october death toll to 53 .
the attacks on soldiers and civilians comes as us president barack obama weighs whether to send more soldiers to the country to fight the growing insurgency .
the commander of us and nato forces in afghanistan , general stanley mcchrystal , has asked for 40,000 more troops to carry out a counter-insurgency campaign .
if he does not get a substantial infusion of troops , he has said , the afghan mission could fail. jam / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is often because they speak tibetan rather than chinese .
on the other hand , tibetans sometimes complain that their culture is being forgotten and that tibetans are becoming more and more chinese .
however , there are positive counter-examples - in qinghai for example , where the dalai lama is from .
a lot of tibetans still live there today and one village is making sure children are educated in both languages . gelek is usually woken by the dog at about 6 am .
the seven-year-old lives in a mud hut near a meadow where yaks graze .
before setting off for school , he drinks a salty , buttery tea that his mother has prepared and eats some homemade bread .
to get to school , gelek has to cross fields with grazing yaks and pass mud huts where buddhist prayer flags flutter in the wind .
he lives in the mountainous province of qinghai , which neighbours tibet .
100 pupils in a 1960s building gelek gets to school at 8.20 am .
the 1960s building is four storeys high .
the teacher ning says that there are more than 100 pupils .
“ about half of the families here can be described as poor , ” ning explains .
“ in the cities , children have computer courses from the first or second form onwards and they also learn how to play the piano or another instrument .
but we can not offer that to our children here . ”
but until recently the biggest problem was not poverty but language .
almost all the children speak fluent tibetan but not one word of chinese , says duan zhi who is himself tibetan .
the 28-year-old works for an ngo that wants to improve living conditions for tibetan children .
“ the children are growing up in a purely tibetan environment .
but suddenly when they start going to school , they find themselves among chinese people .
the children don ’ t understand a word and that ’ s why they fall behind with their work .
the villagers complained to the local authorities , ” recalls duan zhi .
model bilingual school project their complaints did not fall on deaf ears .
the small village school has become a model project .
not only chinese teachers are employed but tibetan ones as well .
the pupils are taught in both languages .
the teacher , ning , says this will be an advantage in future .
he knows that he only got the job because he speaks both languages .
“ the children know that they are behind compared to those in the cities .
they see what children in the cities can do on television , the chances that they have .
they know many tibetans don ’ t get jobs later .
if they only speak tibetan it ’ s hard for them in china . ”
the break is over .
gelek is concentrating on the blackboard : “ i like tibetan .
our script is so beautiful ; i like to read in tibetan , ” he says .
but although he finds it hard gelek also wants to learn chinese because he knows it ’ s a way out of poverty .
his dream is to speak both languages well and to become a teacher .
his well-educated tibetan teacher ning is his idol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 28.10.2009 turkey 's relationship with israel in doubt after diplomatic rows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has been distancing itself from israel , once a key ally in the region for more than a decade , turkey and israel have enjoyed a strategic relationship .
but now their future as allies appears to be in doubt as turkey sparks a series of diplomatic rows . the latest chapter in increasingly ugly relations between turkey and israel - once close allies - centers around a turkish tv series .
israeli soldiers are shown murdering palestinian children .
one of them smiles at a soldier , but he shoots her in cold blood .
the program sparked outrage in tel aviv , especially since it appeared on state television .
the turkish government said that it could not interfere with programming .
earlier this month turkey banned israeli jets from participating - as they had in the past - in a turkish military exercise .
a new bilateral relationship " turkish public opinion could not agree with the fact that israeli aircraft would be training on turkish territory , while at the same time there are gross human rights violations being committed in gaza , " suat kiniklioglu , a spokesman for the turkish parliamentary committee on foreign affairs said .
" given the current state of relations , it is difficult to describe it as a strategic relationship anymore .
it is a relationship that maybe was strategic in the past , but it 's probably downgraded to a more ordinary bilateral relationship , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have broadly condemned israel 's attacks against the gaza strip turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly condemned israel 's treatment of palestinians , even accusing the israelis of using weapons of mass destruction against gaza .
but the tough stance is causing concern among turkey 's allies , both in europe and in the us .
us congressman robert wexler , traditionally a supporter of turkey , has attacked prime minister erdogan for harboring a double standard .
" where 's the outrage when the prime minister talks about no tolerance for terror ? "
wexler asked .
" the terror in this region is created by hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza !
where was the outrage for years as there were strikes against civilian targets in israel ? "
syria 's impact on turkey-israeli relations the basis for turkey 's close political and military relationship with israel was a common enemy they shared in the 1990s : syria .
damascus , at that time , was providing protection for abdullah ocalan , whose kurdish rebel movement , the pkk , was fighting the turkish state .
but with the support of israel , turkey successfully forced the syrians to expel ocalan , which resulted in his capture .
that incident paved the way for a rapid improvement in its relations with syria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between turkey and syria have improved , making israel less important to ankara , analysts say " we 've come into a remarkable time period , where turkey and syria enjoy extremely cordial relations , " said kiniklioglu .
" this has probably structurally lessened the need for turkey and israel to be -lsb- as -rsb- close as they were in the 90s . "
analysts say the political and military strategic alliance which once existed between turkey and israel was the most powerful alliance in the region .
but for now at least , those days seem to be over .
with erdogan working hard to improve relations with syria , iraq , and even iran - as his recent visit to tehran shows - few people see much chance of a renewal of that alliance anytime soon .

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .
about 2,280 migrants have reached the canaries so far this year , while 2,360 have been stopped in or off africa .
only two migrant boats had set off from senegal over the past nine months , while nearly 8,000 migrants landed in the islands in 2008 .

a german-based poetry web site offers 5,500 poems in dozens of languages available to read and hear . for a decade now , the lyrikline web site has demonstrated that poetry is not just words but also sound . " it 's not enough to read a poem , " said christiane lange from the berlin literature workshop .
" a poem has a rhythm , it breathes .
when you hear it - especially when it 's read by the poet - it takes on a kind of physical presence . " that 's precisely why the lange and the berlin literature workshop founded the lyrikline web site , where users can not only read over 5,500 poems , but also listen to recordings of them being read . " we started with 16 poets , and the project grew and grew , " she said .
" now we have partners in 41 countries . " the berlin literature workshop decides together with its partners which poems are added to the site - and quality is more important to them than quantity , organizers have said .
they want the poets whose works are chosen to see their inclusion in the project as an honor . pairing up for translation nico bleutge , for example , was invited to participate six years ago after winning the leonce and lena competition , one of the most important german-language lyric contests .
since then , bleutge has recorded 10 of his works for lyrikline and all of them have been translated into languages like english , spanish and russian , as well as danish and farsi . some poets , like bleutge , are personally asked to record their poems .
others send submissions to lyrikline themselves , said lange .
a third possibility , however , is through translation - and that 's the idea behind finding partners in other countries . " the network of partners is also a translation network , " said lange .
" everyone commits to translate works by other poets into their own language and vice versa . " bildunterschrift : " decyphering a poem before the invention of lyrikline " bleutge has taken part in two translation workshops , where he was paired up with spanish poet vicente luis mora .
each translated the other 's work into his native language . " you have the possibility to ask the poet personally about the tiniest details or about the rhythm , and you learn a lot about your own texts , " said bleutge .
" you get lots of questions from the other poets , which force you to look critically and what you wrote . " the close cooperation between poet and translator ensures that quality remains high .
on the lyrikline web site , the original poem can be viewed next to the translation in two separate windows , allowing for easy comparison . a closer connection there 's also a search function and biographical information about the poets .
the idea is to find a large audience for poems that typically would only be read by a few people . " it 's a really good feeling to get responses , " said bleutge , " sometimes in person , sometimes by email .
most people do n't just read the poem , they also listen to it , so there 's a greater sense of closeness between us authors and the readers . " lange said she often listens to poems read in languages that she can not understand . " it 's like a concert , " she said .

but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .
then this week , ahead of a two-day visit to iran , erdogan dismissed western worries over teheran 's controversial nuclear program as ' gossip ' and accused the perpetrators of hypocrisy .
" although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper .
his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

his comments were welcomed by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who called on his neighbor to strengthen existing bi-lateral ties .
" iran-turkey cooperation would benefit both countries , the region and the whole world , " state broadcaster irib quoted ahmadinejad as saying .
good local relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad gave erdogan a warm welcome to iran but is that the kind of partnerhsip into which erdogan wishes to enter ?
guelay kizilocak , deputy chairwoman of germany 's center for studies on turkey , says the picture is much broader .
" turkey wants to have its say in the middle east , " she told deutsche welle .
" and in order to help shape the region , it wants to improve relations with all those countries in it . "
indeed , ankara 's ' zero problems with neighbors ' policy of the past few years has resulted in the abolition of visa requirements for syria , a breakthrough in the country 's difficult relations with armenia and closer ties with teheran .
" iran is part of the overall package , " kizilocak stressed .
" it is an important country in the region , so if turkey wants relations with syria and iraq , it has to have them with iran as well . "
protecting its own interests cemal karakas , a turkey expert with the peace research institute in frankfurt says ankara has been trying to enhance its profile in the middle east for some time .
" turkey is no longer a neutral observer in the region , sticking rigidly to the nato doctrine , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's foreign policy is more active and has turkey 's interests at heart . "
and one of those is fuel .
turkey is a poor country and relies heavily not only on azerbaijan but iran for energy supplies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has one eye on iran 's gas in pursuing it own interests , however , turkey does not necessarily walk in step with the west , and thereby potentially damages its chances as occident - orient go-between .
but karakas is n't convinced that turkey is up to the job of mediator .
" a country can only propagate peace to the outside world if it is peaceful itself , " he said with reference to turkey 's treatment of kurds and religious minorities .
" there has been progress , but not enough to meet eu standards . "
keeping options open the question many commentators are asking is whether , in light of recent gestures to the east , turkey still wants a place in brussels .
kizilocak says it does , but says the euphoria turks once felt at the prospect of membership has been quelled by the reality that the eu is keeping them at arms length .
as it stands , the earliest they could join is 2015 , but in terms of politics that is a long way off , and it is conceivable that by then , interest will have waned altogether .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will there ever be a gold star for turkey ?
karakas says that even if brussels did decide to let ankara in , it would not open the door as wide as it has to other members .
" the eu has outlined a series of protection clauses , " he said , citing conditions which would limit the free movement of people and restrict financial support for farmers .
" these things are making their way into the debate and people are starting to wonder why they should make the effort to take the necessary steps it they are not going to be treated the same as other countries . "
so although turkey will continue with its accession negotiations , it is realistic enough not to put all its eggs in the european basket .
it is actively pursuing other options , a third path , as karakas puts it .
and that might ultimately see it drawn deeper into the middle east fold or holding hands with fuel-rich russia .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .
about 2,280 migrants have reached the canaries so far this year , while 2,360 have been stopped in or off africa .
only two migrant boats had set off from senegal over the past nine months , while nearly 8,000 migrants landed in the islands in 2008 .
frontex has been operating since october 2005 , and patrols 42,000 kilometers -lrb- 26,000 miles -rrb- of the eu 's sea borders and 8,800 kilometers of land frontier. bk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then israeli-turkish relations , traditionally very strong , have been on a steady downward curve which culminated in ankara excluding israel from a recent nato exercise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 28.10.2009 germany 's wage gap also a regional issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in eastern germany find it easier to combine kids with a career the wage gap between men and women is much lower in eastern germany than in the western states , research suggests , citing better availability of day care in the east as the most decisive factor . according to research conducted by the cologne-based german economic institute -lrb- iwd -rrb- , women in eastern germany earn almost as much as their male colleagues , with a wage gap of six percent .
in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .
a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

a recent study by the hamburg-based world economic institute showed that women who re-enter the workforce after taking extensive maternity leave earn on average 33 percent less than women without children .
it also takes working mothers a long time to recover from such a large salary setback .
at age 45 , working mothers still earn 26 percent less than their female colleagues without children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany has an extensive network of day care facilities full time vs part time women in eastern germany also outstrip their counterparts in the west when it comes to working full time .
some 70 percent of women in the eastern states work full time compared to 65 percent in the west .
according to a survey conducted by the federal office for statistics , two-thirds of women working part-time jobs in the east only do so because they could n't find full-time work .
in western germany , that was only true for 17 percent of the survey respondents .
these attitudes are also a product of socialization in the post-1949 period , heineman said .
" if the state demands that women work full-time , as in east germany , then girls are socialized to look forward to full-time work .
if the system is set up to discourage women 's full-time work , as in the west , then girls are socialized to think part-time work will be preferable , " she said .
such attitudes could explain current data which shows that young women in eastern germany are academically outperforming female students in the western states .
in 2008 , for example , 32 percent of secondary school graduates in western germany received the diploma known as " abitur " to qualify them for further study at a university .
the rate in eastern germany was 47 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in germany tend to steer clear of engineering degrees technical careers unpopular but generally , few women across germany end up pursuing technical degrees such as engineering , despite the lure of higher paid jobs .
only 12 percent of engineers in germany are female - a trend that has a number of causes , said lutz galilaeer , researcher at the nuremberg-based research institute for industrial education , fbb .
" girls in germany still hang onto the old gender roles and patterns , and when studying , they tend to look for subjects that are more typically female , " galilaeer said .
he added that many young women might be discouraged by the demanding nature of a technical degree such as engineering , where certain branches have a drop-out rate as high as 40 percent .
galilaeer also raised the question of what women want out of their careers .
" technical jobs are still very much dominated by men , and it 's difficult for women to get into these fields , " he said .
" an employer may ask , when presented with a female applicant , will she do well in this environment ?
will she be able to work as hard as a man ?
will she leave in a few years to have children ? "
to redress the gender imbalance in technical careers , the government and private companies have sponsored several programs to attract more women .
in june of 2008 , the government launched its " mint " pact , with the aim of attracting women to careers in mathematics , it , natural science and technology .
but according to galilaeer , progress has been slow .
" it 's a long-term process , " he said .
" in the last few years , the trend has been that the numbers of women in technical jobs are slowly going up , but it 's still at a very low level .
it needs to become totally normal for a woman to say she wants to become an engineer , and then these differences wo n't exist anymore . "
but he adds that as long as societal structures - such as a lack of organized day care for working mothers - continue to impede women 's ability to participate in the workforce , germany 's wage gap will never be resolved .

in western germany , however , women earn an average 24 percent less than men , the iwd said , citing data from the federal office for statistics in wiesbaden .
the availability of day care plays a major role in this regional difference .
in the former east germany , over 90 percent of women worked outside the home - something that was only possible due to an extensive network of professional day care facilities .
twenty years after east germany 's collapse , this legacy is still intact .
according to the iwd , 42 percent of children under the age of three currently have a place at a day care facility in eastern germany .
in western germany , only 12 percent of children in this age group attend day care .
" young mothers in western germany have to invest a lot of time in raising and caring for their children , because there 's a lack of care options , " the iwd said in its report .
" mothers in eastern germany find it much easier to drop their child off at a trusted day care in the morning and then rush to the office . "
bildunterschrift : in the former west germany , professional day care was not developed as extensively due to the family ideology that prevailed in the west during the cold war period .
" west germany developed a very strong ideology of the ' housewife marriage ' specifically to differentiate itself from the east , " said elizabeth heineman , an expert on german history and gender studies at the university of iowa 's history department .
" the fact of extensive women 's employment and the reliance on day care in the east became a marker of how destructive communism was to the family , and so west germany worked hard to differentiate itself from that . "
she added that the catholic and conservative protestant churches were also very influential in promoting the housewife marriage , whereas the influence of religion was greatly dulled in east germany .
as a result , women in western germany are still more likely to take time off to raise their children - something that greatly impacts how much they earn when they do eventually go back to work .

but the drop is probably also down to the recession . the european union has seen a sharp drop in the number of illegal migrants caught entering the bloc this year , a senior official of security agency frontex said on wednesday .
a total of 51,600 illegal border crossings were detected during the first six months of 2009 , 17 percent less than in the same period last year , frontex deputy director gil arias fernandez told a news conference in madrid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities have 8,800 kilometers of land frontier to patrol fernandez said that frontex sea patrols had helped to drastically reduce the number of would-be migrants , but he acknowledged that the global economic downturn had also had a significant effect .
no job to come to the recession is discouraging migrants from heading to the eu because they are less confident of finding a job in the 27-nation bloc , which posted a 4.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2009 . at the same time it is harder for them to pay for the crossing , which can cost several hundred euros .
" nobody puts their life at risk if they do not have the prospect of a better one , " said fernandez , who predicted the fall in the number of migrant arrivals would continue during the rest of the year and into 2010 .
but although illegal arrivals were down overall , sea arrivals in greece rose to 14,000 during the first half of 2009 from 9,500 during the same time last year , mostly due to larger detections of nationals from afghanistan and somalia .
seventy percent of the eu 's illegal border crossings this year occurred into greece , while italy accounted for 13 percent and spain around nine percent , according to frontex statistics .
working with senegal fernandez also praised the eu 's cooperation with the government of senegal , which is working harder to prevent illegal immigrants from leaving the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants are sometimes dealt with by force for the first time , more migrants are being prevented from leaving africa than are arriving in the canaries .
about 2,280 migrants have reached the canaries so far this year , while 2,360 have been stopped in or off africa .
only two migrant boats had set off from senegal over the past nine months , while nearly 8,000 migrants landed in the islands in 2008 .
frontex has been operating since october 2005 , and patrols 42,000 kilometers -lrb- 26,000 miles -rrb- of the eu 's sea borders and 8,800 kilometers of land frontier. bk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 28.10.2009 eu tells car industry to stop selling inefficent vehicles or face fines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu fears its car industry will miss the opportunity to lead the world in innovation europe 's car industry has been told to stop selling its most inefficient vehicles by 2016 , or face hefty fines .
but the car industry , worried about recovering from the global economic slump , is fighting back . the european commission has come under intense pressure from the car industry over its plans to penalize the sale of inefficient vehicles , namely vans and minibuses .
automakers say they want a chance to recover from the financial crisis before cutting down on carbon emissions . but after delaying its plan for four years , brussels is trying yet again to force them to stop producing so much carbon .
the eu 's environment commissioner , stavros dimas , admits that the new legislation has been watered-down .
" what we have adopted today is not the initial proposal , and the level of ambition was not as high as it was initially , " dimas said .
new eu rules for auto-makers the new legislation involves carbon emissions cuts for commercial vehicles of 14 percent between 2014 and 2016 - to 175 grams for every kilometer driven .
the eu average today is 203 grams .
the goal is to get van makers to reduce that to 135 grams by 2020 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has invested heavily in green technology europe 's biggest car-making countries , france , italy , and germany had wanted the deadline for emissions cuts extended to 2017 . the eu commission 's original proposal had sought cuts by 2012 .
dimas rejects the claim that the deadline pushback sends the wrong signal to the car industry .
he says it will make little difference in terms of emissions saved .
" we have a proposal on the table , and a proposal for a decision , and of course it 's up to the other institutions to improve on this proposal .
if we did n't have a proposal today , whether we would have one in the near future or not is uncertain , " said dimas .
carmakers that fail to make the targets will then face hefty penalties .
up until 2018 , the fine will be five euros -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- per van for the first excess gram , and will sharply increase for every excess gram after that .
from 2019 , the first excess gram will cost offending car-makers 120 euros per vehicle .
the eu 's environment chief believes the fines will serve as a strong incentive for european auto manufacturers to get serious about clean technology .
global competition stavros dimas warned that carmakers risk losing the ' first-mover advantage ' and called on them to grab the chance to innovate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment chief stavros dimas admits the new proposal is not as ambitious as the first " otherwise other regions of the world will get ahead of us , for example , the united states is investing a lot in green technologies ; china is investing a lot ; south korea - almost 70 percent of its recovery plan is going to green technology investment , " he said .
not to mention japan , which leaves the european union trailing on innovation , and whose new government has now set its emissions cuts target at 25 percent .
the commission says those targets will provide the japanese auto-sector fresh incentives to innovate .
but dimas says he 's had a tough time persuading the car industry to make emissions cuts .
the best the commission can hope for is that europe 's car industry wakes up to the need to innovate fast .
if manufacturers do not start producing cleaner cars , they threaten to undo all the work the eu has done so far to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

the enterprise and learning committee says there is a lack of consistency in screening of children in both english and welsh medium education .
it says the problem is worse in the welsh medium with some schools needing more support .
the welsh assembly government welcomed the report and said it was committed to more research " in this important area " .
the committee 's report is a follow-up to its investigation into the provision of support for children with dyslexia in july 2008 .
recommendations in the latest report include : the provision of a specialist dyslexia teacher for every cluster of primary schools .
establishing courses to train teachers to develop expertise in dyslexia , not just additional learning needs .
the training courses in dyslexia should be made available for all staff working with children in the classroom .
all local authorities in wales should provide a welsh-medium service for screening and supporting children with dyslexia , including funding for the provision of standard norms for testing the assembly government should fund the welsh dyslexia project to run a free helpline for users in wales , in both the welsh and english languages .
' early identification ' dyslexia is commonly understood to be a term covering a range of types of learning difficulty where someone of normal intelligence has persistent and significant problems with reading , writing , spelling .
case study gloria jones , from swansea , a teacher for 20 years .
ms jones took a year 's course in dyslexia teaching two years ago and teaches at ysgol gymraeg lonlas , near llansamlet .
" dyslexic children think differently in the way they read .
their brain processes information differently .
what they are seeing is the letter reversed .
some actually see the letters jumping off the page .
" because they are not doing so well , they lose their self esteem .
it 's a downward spiral .
you have to get their confidence up again .
" perhaps it 's easier in welsh because it 's phonetic but they still have these problems because they see the letters reversed .
every class has got some dyslexic children .
some are badly dyslexic .
" the course was very beneficial .
we had lots of lecturers showing the different games we could do and why it was good for the children . "
education minister jane hutt said she had recently agreed to provide £ 2m over three years to set up pilot schemes to reform the current system and establish additional learning needs co-ordinators .
gareth jones , am , the chair of the committee said the assembly government should focus on early identification of people with dyslexia .
" while we are encouraged with the action taken by the minister since we published our report on support for people with dyslexia in july 2008 , the committee believes the welsh government should focus on ensuring that early identification of , and support for , people with dyslexia is available in both the english and welsh languages , " he said .
the assembly government said : " it is crucial that children and young people have access to tests which are language specific , standardised and age appropriate .
" to fully achieve the committee 's recommendations and meet the needs of children and young people with dyslexia we have commissioned research , particularly in relation to available , valid and reliable screening and assessment , procedures for accurate identification and effective intervention programmes .
" as part of this work additional topics have been added to include a review of the cross-linguistic literature on dyslexia and existing work on dyslexia among speakers / readers of welsh . "

the enterprise and learning committee says there is a lack of consistency in screening of children in both english and welsh medium education .
it says the problem is worse in the welsh medium with some schools needing more support .
the welsh assembly government welcomed the report and said it was committed to more research " in this important area " .
the committee 's report is a follow-up to its investigation into the provision of support for children with dyslexia in july 2008 .
recommendations in the latest report include : the provision of a specialist dyslexia teacher for every cluster of primary schools .
establishing courses to train teachers to develop expertise in dyslexia , not just additional learning needs .
the training courses in dyslexia should be made available for all staff working with children in the classroom .
all local authorities in wales should provide a welsh-medium service for screening and supporting children with dyslexia , including funding for the provision of standard norms for testing the assembly government should fund the welsh dyslexia project to run a free helpline for users in wales , in both the welsh and english languages .

education minister jane hutt said she had recently agreed to provide £ 2m over three years to set up pilot schemes to reform the current system and establish additional learning needs co-ordinators .
gareth jones , am , the chair of the committee said the assembly government should focus on early identification of people with dyslexia .
" while we are encouraged with the action taken by the minister since we published our report on support for people with dyslexia in july 2008 , the committee believes the welsh government should focus on ensuring that early identification of , and support for , people with dyslexia is available in both the english and welsh languages , " he said .
the assembly government said : " it is crucial that children and young people have access to tests which are language specific , standardised and age appropriate .
" to fully achieve the committee 's recommendations and meet the needs of children and young people with dyslexia we have commissioned research , particularly in relation to available , valid and reliable screening and assessment , procedures for accurate identification and effective intervention programmes .

brecon and radnorshire mp roger williams said there were more fatal and serious accidents in the county in 2008 than anywhere else in wales .
figures show powys topping a welsh road crash league table for six years .
the assembly government said road casualties showed a drop of 13 % from last year in powys and reducing the number across wales was a " priority " .
mr williams pointed to statistics which showed there were 1,190 fatal and serious road incidents in wales last year , a decrease of more than 400 on the average for 1994-98 .
the majority of casualties involved people aged between 16 and 24 , the assembly government statistics show .
here in powys we have some very difficult and complicated roads which even experienced drivers can find treacherous in poor conditions roger williams mp the number of fatal and serious accidents in powys was 104 in 2008 , a reduction of two on 2007 and a fall of 27 on the 1994-98 average .
the figures are falling , but liberal democrat mp mr williams said more work was needed to hasten the decline .
he added : " the tragedy of young people being killed on our roads can not be solved simply by making driving tests more and more difficult .
" instead the government needs to ensure that transport policy takes into account the changing way in which our roads are used and work to make the roads , not just the drivers safer .
" here in powys we have some very difficult and complicated roads which even experienced drivers can find treacherous in poor conditions .
these roads are even more dangerous for people on motorbikes . "
' safety features ' he said new technology applied to safety features could cut the number of not just young people , but of all road users who are killed or injured each year .
a welsh assembly government spokesman said reducing road casualties in all parts of wales was a priority .
" figures show that all road casualties were down by 9 % in wales over the last year and earlier this year the institute of advanced motorists recognised wales as having the best road safety record in the uk , " he said .
" in powys , road casualties show a decrease of 13 % from last year and a 5 % decrease in motorcycle casualties . "
but the spokesman said there was more to be done and " we continue to develop and implement road safety measures on our trunk road network " and provide grants to councils to reduce casualties .

the thoroughbred rehabilitation centre , at halton near lancaster , is dedicated to the welfare , rehabilitation and re-homing of racehorses .
horses that come to the centre can have injuries and behavioural issues , but the hope is that they can be found a happy new home .
recycling racehorses is n't easy , but it 's a rewarding job .
carrie spent much of 1991 working with her friend 's father preparing his thoroughbred stock for sales .
as a direct result of going to these bloodstock sales carrie saw first hand the reality of what the horses face when their racing days are over - thoroughbreds that are either at the end of their career , or those that never made it , can end up in the wrong hands , neglected and abused .
famous resident so carrie conceived the idea of the trc .
by 1993 carrie had been granted charitable status for the trc and was awarded the mbe in the summer of 2003 for services to racehorse welfare .
the trc is based at whinney hill where the horses get to put their hooves up in 230 acres .
there 's an indoor and outdoor school , horse walking area and a veterinary treatment barn , which is in the final stages of completion .
desert orchid used to spend his summer holidays at the trc it 's not cheap to run .
the centre costs nearly £ 1500 per day and they rely mainly on the generosity of the horse-loving public to continue .
the recession has obviously led to a reduction in donations and the amount available from charitable trusts , so much so that they can currently only afford to keep 25 horses , instead of the usual 31 .
the horses have had a hard working life , and tendon and leg problems are common , as are back and pelvis injuries , so they get their own physiotherapist !
she works closely with the vet on damaged or sore muscle groups enabling the horse to heal and work more effectively .
perhaps the most famous resident was grand national winner hallo dandy .
" dan " came to the centre in fairly poor shape , but made a quick recovery and was used as the centre hack .
dan spent 12 happy horsey years at the centre and attended the grand national parade regularly until his death in 2007 at the grand age of 33 .
active so what is it like to ride a grand national winner ?
" apparently he was generally good to ride although very strong !
he was full of character and a very independent spirit ! " says fundraising development manager tracey lyons .
shiatsu - or finger pressure massage - practitioner sue smith tracey is one of thirteen staff who work at the centre , six of them directly responsible for riding and training the horses .
it 's important to keep the horses active as tracey explains : " all horses taken into the trc have to be re-homed as ridden horses .
the type of work they do depends on any existing injuries or conditions .
most make good hacks and are able to compete in local dressage or riding club activities . "
so how hard is it to re-home a racehorse ?
" how long is a piece of string !
they are all so different and it very much depends on finding the right loaner for the horse .
this can be a very quick process or lengthy depending on the specific needs of the horse . "
even when a suitable home is found , the horses remain the property of the trc and they are only loaned to their new owners .
the loan homes are monitored for the rest of the horse 's life .
it 's a successful formula , to date well over 200 horses have found a new home .
tracey says the team are suitably proud of what they do : " there 's nothing like seeing horses successfully re-homed and enjoying life in their new loan home . "
the trc is always looking for volunteers to help at various events across the country , throughout the year .
they also offer support to anyone wanting to organise their own fundraising events .
people with equine experience are needed as voluntary field officers , to visit re-homed horses in their new homes .
the centre also hosts yard visits throughout the year , allowing visitors to gain an insight into work at the centre .
they are also planning a two day schooling clinic on 6 and 7 may 2010 .
this will give the opportunity to take your own ex-racehorse to the centre , where you can learn about flatwork and jumping , or get help with any problems you might have with your horse .

recycling racehorses is n't easy , but it 's a rewarding job .
carrie spent much of 1991 working with her friend 's father preparing his thoroughbred stock for sales .
as a direct result of going to these bloodstock sales carrie saw first hand the reality of what the horses face when their racing days are over - thoroughbreds that are either at the end of their career , or those that never made it , can end up in the wrong hands , neglected and abused .
famous resident so carrie conceived the idea of the trc .
by 1993 carrie had been granted charitable status for the trc and was awarded the mbe in the summer of 2003 for services to racehorse welfare .
the trc is based at whinney hill where the horses get to put their hooves up in 230 acres .
there 's an indoor and outdoor school , horse walking area and a veterinary treatment barn , which is in the final stages of completion .
desert orchid used to spend his summer holidays at the trc it 's not cheap to run .
the centre costs nearly £ 1500 per day and they rely mainly on the generosity of the horse-loving public to continue .
the recession has obviously led to a reduction in donations and the amount available from charitable trusts , so much so that they can currently only afford to keep 25 horses , instead of the usual 31 .
the horses have had a hard working life , and tendon and leg problems are common , as are back and pelvis injuries , so they get their own physiotherapist !
she works closely with the vet on damaged or sore muscle groups enabling the horse to heal and work more effectively .
perhaps the most famous resident was grand national winner hallo dandy .
" dan " came to the centre in fairly poor shape , but made a quick recovery and was used as the centre hack .
dan spent 12 happy horsey years at the centre and attended the grand national parade regularly until his death in 2007 at the grand age of 33 .
active so what is it like to ride a grand national winner ?
" apparently he was generally good to ride although very strong !
he was full of character and a very independent spirit ! " says fundraising development manager tracey lyons .
shiatsu - or finger pressure massage - practitioner sue smith tracey is one of thirteen staff who work at the centre , six of them directly responsible for riding and training the horses .
it 's important to keep the horses active as tracey explains : " all horses taken into the trc have to be re-homed as ridden horses .
the type of work they do depends on any existing injuries or conditions .
most make good hacks and are able to compete in local dressage or riding club activities . "
so how hard is it to re-home a racehorse ?
" how long is a piece of string !
they are all so different and it very much depends on finding the right loaner for the horse .
this can be a very quick process or lengthy depending on the specific needs of the horse . "
even when a suitable home is found , the horses remain the property of the trc and they are only loaned to their new owners .
the loan homes are monitored for the rest of the horse 's life .
it 's a successful formula , to date well over 200 horses have found a new home .
tracey says the team are suitably proud of what they do : " there 's nothing like seeing horses successfully re-homed and enjoying life in their new loan home . "
the trc is always looking for volunteers to help at various events across the country , throughout the year .
they also offer support to anyone wanting to organise their own fundraising events .
people with equine experience are needed as voluntary field officers , to visit re-homed horses in their new homes .
the centre also hosts yard visits throughout the year , allowing visitors to gain an insight into work at the centre .
they are also planning a two day schooling clinic on 6 and 7 may 2010 .
this will give the opportunity to take your own ex-racehorse to the centre , where you can learn about flatwork and jumping , or get help with any problems you might have with your horse .
