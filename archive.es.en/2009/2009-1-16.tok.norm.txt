merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately . "
a deteriorating energy situation caused by gas shortages was particularly grim in moldova .
there was no hot water throughout the former soviet republic , and major industrial plants remained idle .
residential heating was minimal with fuel-short central heating plants struggling to bring sufficient warmth to radiators .
" all of this has gone for too long , " laitenberger of the eu commission said .
the eu relies on russian gas via ukraine for around a fifth of its supplies , mostly via ukraine .
germany , europe 's largest economy , is even more dependent , with moscow supplying 37 percent of its needs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to many , he is still a hero . it was the most drastic protest against the soviet-led invasion which crushed the communist reform movement - the so-called prague spring in 1968 . at 2:30 in the afternoon on jan .
16 , 1969 , 20-year-old university student jan palach poured gasoline over himself in wenceslas square and set himself on fire .
his self-immolation is viewed as a symbol of the despair felt by the people in czechoslovakia under moscow 's oppressive hand . a streetcar worker was the first to react to the flames and used his coat to cover palach and extinguish the flames .
the philosophy student was taken to hospital , where his first words were reportedly : " i 'm not committing suicide ! " covered in burns , he was interviewed by a psychiatrist who worked for the czechoslovakian secret police .
the doctor asked palach if he was in pain .
" enough , " he said .
" people have to fight against evil when they can , " he continued in a choked-up voice .
palach died three days later , refusing pain medication until the end . suffering for a cause in his farewell letter , palach mentioned a group of people who had all decided to burn themselves as a political protest .
he was the first and there were more burnings in the weeks and months following . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague has seen many protests come and go , but palach wo n't be forgotten his act even spurred copycats as recently as in 2003 when a series of self-burnings as a form of protest broke out in the nation . palach 's burial was attended by artists , politicians and friends .
some 200,000 people took part in a funeral march for him through prague . " palach 's death was immediately understood by society , " vaclav havel , playwright and later president of czechoslovakia , said in an interview at the time .
" everyone wants to do something extreme when everything else is so helpless . " havel himself was arrested in 1989 for laying flowers by a statue in honor of the 20th anniversary of palach 's death . a hero for some " in his state of helplessness , he offered the only thing he had - his life , " said jakub trojan , the evangelical pastor at palach 's burial . the 40th anniversary of the young student 's act in downtown prague and his death are marked by numerous memorial events . as one czech university student recently told deutschlandfunk broadcaster , palch is viewed " as a hero , because he was prepared to sacrifice his life due to the political situation .
i can say that i 'm proud to be a student in the same faculty that he studied in . " palach 's life and death are also the subject of a 600-page book that has just been published . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at this moment , we do have enough countries " to launch a system of enhanced cooperation on divorce issues , czech justice minister jiri pospisil , who headed the informal meeting of eu counterparts in prague , told journalists . the concept of " enhanced cooperation " was created by the eu 's 1997 treaty of amsterdam .
it allows groups of at least eight member states to ask the commission to apply eu-level laws to them if the bloc as a whole has failed to approve the legislation . but eu justice commissioner jacques barrot countered that claim , saying the current group of countries " is not enough " to launch such cooperation , " because at that moment we would have a very fragmented family law . " in 2006 , the commission - the eu ’ s executive arm - proposed a bloc-wide rule setting out which national divorce law should apply when mixed-nationality couples split , but sweden vetoed it , arguing that it could bind swedes to less liberal divorce laws . " it would mean that the right to get a divorce would be not as good in sweden , and i ca n't accept that because you can make agreements on many things , but not to lower your fundamental rights , " swedish justice minister beatrice ask said in prague . some eu states still seek law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european states have higher than average divorce rates following the veto , nine eu states - austria , bulgaria , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg , romania , slovenia and spain - wrote to the commission for permission to apply the eu-level law anyway .
france was reportedly preparing to join the group in january . " the fact that one country has big problems with moving forwards in this domain should encourage the others to go on .
it 's not the ideal solution , but i think that sometimes you have to use the possibilities offered by the treaty , " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden said . the enhanced-cooperation system has not yet been used .
barrot , the eu commissioner , said friday that he did not see the need to start now . he said that at least half the eu 's 27 member states would have to ask for enhanced cooperation for it to become realistic . but the czech minister , pospisil , said that support for the idea of enhanced cooperation " is actually rising " among eu states , and that the czech eu presidency was ready to open a debate on the subject . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .

" at this moment , we do have enough countries " to launch a system of enhanced cooperation on divorce issues , czech justice minister jiri pospisil , who headed the informal meeting of eu counterparts in prague , told journalists . the concept of " enhanced cooperation " was created by the eu 's 1997 treaty of amsterdam .
it allows groups of at least eight member states to ask the commission to apply eu-level laws to them if the bloc as a whole has failed to approve the legislation . but eu justice commissioner jacques barrot countered that claim , saying the current group of countries " is not enough " to launch such cooperation , " because at that moment we would have a very fragmented family law . " in 2006 , the commission - the eu ’ s executive arm - proposed a bloc-wide rule setting out which national divorce law should apply when mixed-nationality couples split , but sweden vetoed it , arguing that it could bind swedes to less liberal divorce laws . " it would mean that the right to get a divorce would be not as good in sweden , and i ca n't accept that because you can make agreements on many things , but not to lower your fundamental rights , " swedish justice minister beatrice ask said in prague . some eu states still seek law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european states have higher than average divorce rates following the veto , nine eu states - austria , bulgaria , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg , romania , slovenia and spain - wrote to the commission for permission to apply the eu-level law anyway .
france was reportedly preparing to join the group in january . " the fact that one country has big problems with moving forwards in this domain should encourage the others to go on .
it 's not the ideal solution , but i think that sometimes you have to use the possibilities offered by the treaty , " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden said . the enhanced-cooperation system has not yet been used .
barrot , the eu commissioner , said friday that he did not see the need to start now . he said that at least half the eu 's 27 member states would have to ask for enhanced cooperation for it to become realistic . but the czech minister , pospisil , said that support for the idea of enhanced cooperation " is actually rising " among eu states , and that the czech eu presidency was ready to open a debate on the subject . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

closing the facility in guantanamo bay , cuba means that a portion of the remaining 248 prisoners will have to be transferred to other countries . schaeuble also pointed out that , as far as he is aware , none of the remaining guantanamo inmates are germans nor are any of them citizens who grew up in germany . the number of inmates left " is not a number that is unbelievably high , and the us is not a small country , " he added . the question of what to do with the guantanamo bay prisoners has caused controversy outside of germany as well , as several eu countries are at odds over the matter . guantanamo source of eu conflict austria and france voiced their stance against receiving inmates at the eu interior ministers meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates have never been tried , a fact that has sparked human rights debates " america created guantanamo .

according to a spokesperson for the ministry , french foreign minister bernard kouchner wants to " review the matter favorably . " kouchner 's stance clearly illustrates the widespread conflict between eu interior ministers and their foreign ministry counterparts . the netherlands has ruled out accepting any newly freed inmates , while portugal has said it might do so .
sweden has said guantanamo bay is washington 's responsibility and , according to media reports , denmark will refuse any us request to take in prisoners .

" i believe we can reach an agreement that will resolve the situation and lead to the transit of russian gas , " he said through an interpreter . merkel told reporters there might be a test phase where gas pumping was resumed under monitoring by european union inspectors . she said the inspectors would check the pipeline transit system to ensure that gas destined for western europe " does not disappear in ukraine . " " time is of the essence " despite a series of agreements , russian gas exports via ukraine remained cut off for the 10th day friday , leaving some european countries without sufficient fuel to heat homes and factories . " technical " gas is at the focus of the ongoing dispute because ukraine insists it has a right to remove 21 million cubic meters of gas daily to power the pumps whereas russia accuses the ukrainians of " stealing " the gas .
ukraine denies the accusation . " i think we will eventually find a solution , " said merkel , who appealed to both russia and the ukraine to return to the negotiating to end what was essentially a commercial dispute . " time is of the essence , " she said , adding that a settlement was also in the interests of russia and gazprom .
otherwise there would be a loss of confidence in them , she said . " last chance " to resolve the dispute putin earlier met executives of e.on ruhrgas of germany , eni of italy and gaz de france in a berlin hotel . the russian premier proposed that a western consortium pay for technical gas , which is removed from the pipeline to run the equipment that keep the remainder of the gas moving westwards . putin said the cost of the gas to power the pumps would be $ 730 million in the first quarter of this year alone .
he said that strictly speaking , it should be ukraine that paid to power the pumps . although germany is still receiving russian gas via belarus and has high stocks - 59 per cent of maximum storage capacity as of monday this week - it is pressing for a quick end to the kiev-moscow dispute . merkel phoned ukraine 's leaders on thursday , before her meeting with putin , who was paying his first visit to germany since leaving the russian presidency and becoming prime minister in may 2008 . the european union relies on russia for about 20 per cent of its natural gas .
germany , europe 's biggest economy , gets 37 per cent of its gas supplies from russia . putin is due to meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko for talks on energy in moscow on saturday .
on friday , senior officials from eastern europe gathered in kiev for a blitz energy summit . " the european commission believes that the meetings in the coming days offer the last and best chance for russia and ukraine to demonstrate they are serious about resolving this dispute , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said .
" the gas must flow .
we will regard this period as a test case for judging whether or not they are credible partners . " controversy in dresden following his talks with merkel , putin travelled to the eastern city of dresden to pick up an award for promoting russo-german cultural relations . a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , said putin did not deserve the honor because of atrocities committed by russian troops in chechnya during his time as president . putin served as a soviet kgb officer in dresden until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i believe we can reach an agreement that will resolve the situation and lead to the transit of russian gas , " he said through an interpreter . merkel told reporters there might be a test phase where gas pumping was resumed under monitoring by european union inspectors . she said the inspectors would check the pipeline transit system to ensure that gas destined for western europe " does not disappear in ukraine . " " time is of the essence " despite a series of agreements , russian gas exports via ukraine remained cut off for the 10th day friday , leaving some european countries without sufficient fuel to heat homes and factories .

a special forum will concentrate on food supplies in a growing world . the international green week -lrb- igw -rrb- , the world 's largest exhibition for the food industry , agriculture and horticulture , opens its doors on friday , jan .
16 in berlin .
in light of the current economic climate , this year 's igw will be considered an indicator for investment and spending trends in the coming months .
the food and agriculture industries said they had mixed feelings going into the fair .
gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers ' union dbv , said the economic crisis was battering farmers .
" but we 're producing food that is also needed in times of economic crisis , " sonnleitner said at the igw opening press conference .
the chances were good that farmers would continue their work successfully .
the head of the bve food industry federation juergen abraham said consumers would benefit from price pressures on the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green week is about more than just culinary delights and cows " the price increases in food appear to have ceased , " abraham told reporters .
organic food sector untouched by crisis one area that is not suffering at all from the economic downturn is the organic food sector .
" the financial crisis only has little direct impact on the organic food sector , " said thomas dosch , head of germany 's largest organic farmers ' association , bioland .
the organic sector continued to develop positively and " the interest of farmers to switch -lrb- to organics -rrb- is growing , " he said .
in 2008 , sales related to organic food were up by some 10 percent to 5.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- , the federation of the organic food sector bolw said .
despite higher prices , consumers did not want to do without organic food , bolw said .
forum offers platform for global dialogue the international green week forum -lrb- figw -rrb- is also taking place parallel to the trade fair .
it will be offering conferences , workshops and discussions on major issues concerning world food supplies .

" i believe we can reach an agreement that will resolve the situation and lead to the transit of russian gas , " he said through an interpreter . merkel told reporters there might be a test phase where gas pumping was resumed under monitoring by european union inspectors . she said the inspectors would check the pipeline transit system to ensure that gas destined for western europe " does not disappear in ukraine . " " time is of the essence " despite a series of agreements , russian gas exports via ukraine remained cut off for the 10th day friday , leaving some european countries without sufficient fuel to heat homes and factories . " technical " gas is at the focus of the ongoing dispute because ukraine insists it has a right to remove 21 million cubic meters of gas daily to power the pumps whereas russia accuses the ukrainians of " stealing " the gas .
ukraine denies the accusation . " i think we will eventually find a solution , " said merkel , who appealed to both russia and the ukraine to return to the negotiating to end what was essentially a commercial dispute . " time is of the essence , " she said , adding that a settlement was also in the interests of russia and gazprom .
otherwise there would be a loss of confidence in them , she said . " last chance " to resolve the dispute putin earlier met executives of e.on ruhrgas of germany , eni of italy and gaz de france in a berlin hotel . the russian premier proposed that a western consortium pay for technical gas , which is removed from the pipeline to run the equipment that keep the remainder of the gas moving westwards . putin said the cost of the gas to power the pumps would be $ 730 million in the first quarter of this year alone .
he said that strictly speaking , it should be ukraine that paid to power the pumps . although germany is still receiving russian gas via belarus and has high stocks - 59 per cent of maximum storage capacity as of monday this week - it is pressing for a quick end to the kiev-moscow dispute . merkel phoned ukraine 's leaders on thursday , before her meeting with putin , who was paying his first visit to germany since leaving the russian presidency and becoming prime minister in may 2008 . the european union relies on russia for about 20 per cent of its natural gas .
germany , europe 's biggest economy , gets 37 per cent of its gas supplies from russia . putin is due to meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko for talks on energy in moscow on saturday .
on friday , senior officials from eastern europe gathered in kiev for a blitz energy summit . " the european commission believes that the meetings in the coming days offer the last and best chance for russia and ukraine to demonstrate they are serious about resolving this dispute , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said .
" the gas must flow .

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .

it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .

this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .

" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .

14 . lower saxony environment minister hans-heinrich sander said he was only informed of the damage to the storage site thursday , but the radiation office said the ministry had been informed all along . the bfs said it could not rule out damage to the waste containers should the asse site ceiling collapse , but gave its reassurances that it would reinforce the seals of the chamber with concrete to stop any radioactive dust or air escaping . precautionary step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the office says it will reinforce the chamber containing radioactive waste drums the office said the measures were only a precaution and that there was no immediate danger posed by the site .
it said the waste inside the chamber contained only " weak " levels of radioactivity . the site has not been used for fresh radioactive storage since 1978 , with environmental groups regularly calling for waste there to be removed and stored in a safer location . nuclear energy has been a contentious issue in germany for several decades .
a majority of germans oppose the construction of new nuclear plants because of what they believe to be the high risk of a terrorist attack . but with most industrialized nations seeking to lower their carbon footprint , nuclear power has received a fresh breath of life .
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative cdu party says turning back to nuclear could reduce germany 's dependence on russian gas and middle eastern oil . merkel 's party want to examine possible life extensions to some of germany 's 17 nuclear power stations .
not doing so , the party says , would undermine the country 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately . "
a deteriorating energy situation caused by gas shortages was particularly grim in moldova .
there was no hot water throughout the former soviet republic , and major industrial plants remained idle .
residential heating was minimal with fuel-short central heating plants struggling to bring sufficient warmth to radiators .
" all of this has gone for too long , " laitenberger of the eu commission said .
the eu relies on russian gas via ukraine for around a fifth of its supplies , mostly via ukraine .
germany , europe 's largest economy , is even more dependent , with moscow supplying 37 percent of its needs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .
negotiations underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni has been holding talks with western leaders at the same as livni met with rice in washington , israeli negotiator , amos gilad , was returning to egypt friday with instructions from caretaker prime minister ehud olmert , defence minister ehud barak and livni .
only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "

a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .

hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .

“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .

but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , home to europe 's second-largest muslim community , calls are growing to end the bloodshed and spare civilian lives . pro-israeli and pro-palestinian groups have long feuded over who holds the moral high-ground in this ongoing conflict , but consensus is widespread that non-combatants in gaza are paying the price for the inability of hamas and israel to negotiate a peace to this most recent outbreak of violence . in germany , which has western europe 's second-largest muslim population after france , many in the muslim community see hamas as the instigator in this recent episode but are calling for an end to the israeli offensive for the sake of palestinian civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many civilians have been caught up in the gaza war willy ibrahimbegov , 24 , a german muslim whose family emigrated from bosnia in 1989 , said the israeli offensive has been disproportionate when compared with hamas rocket attacks . " i 'm angry because it 's not fair what 's going on , " he said .
" it 's clear that hamas started the war again , but you can not compare ten rockets to what israel is doing .
and you can not compare two israeli lives with a thousand lives in palestine .
these are lives of innocent people , " he said . ibrahimbegov warned that a rising death toll would further stoke palestinian anger , pushing the people in the gaza strip into the arms of hamas . " more and more people will support hamas in palestine because most people there want revenge , " he said . violence not the solution irawati sulamet , 59 , who was born and raised in the world 's most populous muslim nation , indonesia , but has resided in germany for the last 30 years , agreed that israel was provoked into attacking hamas targets , but that the offensive has now gone on too long . " it is hamas who is to blame for the recent hostilities , " she said .
" but the israeli offensive has gone too far now , " she said . most of those interviewed said that war was not the answer to the region 's complex problems . " hamas and the israelis must sit with international representatives and come to peace .
it does n't matter who fired first , " said burak tatlioglu , 53 , a muslim who immigrated to germany from turkey in 1993 and now lives in bonn . jewish groups : hamas to blame for deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe-wide protests have been held to support israel 's right to strike hamas the central council of jews in germany has placed the blame for the recent conflict squarely on hamas and asserted the right of the jewish state to go on the offensive . " the defense of -lrb- israeli -rrb- citizens is not aggression and also not a violation of human rights .
israel has to protect the rights of and its obligation to its citizens , " said president charlotte knobloch on the council 's web site . " hamas carries the exclusive responsibility of civilian casualties on both sides , " she said . the european jewish congress also supported israel 's right to launch an assault in the gaza strip and organized pro-israel demonstrations in berlin , frankfurt and munich over the weekend , which attracted around 2,000 protestors . plea for civilians some muslim organizations in germany , such as the turkish islamic union of the institute of religion -lrb- ditib -rrb- , have avoided playing the blame game and have called simply for an end to hostilities for the sake of civilians in gaza . " we are convinced of the fact that wars , hate and conflict do not bear a solution , but only human misery and pain .
we appeal here to reason and the sense of responsibility of those involved , " said sadi arslan , chairman of the ditib . arslan said both israel and hamas had to return to the negotiating table to find a solution . " a reciprocal renouncement of acts of violence , provocations and law breaking , as well as dialogue between both parties mediated by the world community , is the best way out of this intolerable situation in gaza , " he said . muslim group : hamas , israel both aggressors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-gaza demonstrations have been held all over the world the central council of muslims in germany said israel 's actions violated the principles of international law .
but , he said , hamas too had to end its rocket fire on israeli settlements if a lasting peace was to be found . " the bombardment of mosques , parliament buildings , schools and university mechanisms and many public places -lrb- by israel -rrb- are a condition which can not be accepted and which must be stopped immediately , " said the council 's spokesman erol puerlue . but puerlue also called for an end to hamas rocket attacks on parts of southern israel .

to many , he is still a hero . it was the most drastic protest against the soviet-led invasion which crushed the communist reform movement - the so-called prague spring in 1968 . at 2:30 in the afternoon on jan .
16 , 1969 , 20-year-old university student jan palach poured gasoline over himself in wenceslas square and set himself on fire .
his self-immolation is viewed as a symbol of the despair felt by the people in czechoslovakia under moscow 's oppressive hand . a streetcar worker was the first to react to the flames and used his coat to cover palach and extinguish the flames .
the philosophy student was taken to hospital , where his first words were reportedly : " i 'm not committing suicide ! " covered in burns , he was interviewed by a psychiatrist who worked for the czechoslovakian secret police .
the doctor asked palach if he was in pain .
" enough , " he said .
" people have to fight against evil when they can , " he continued in a choked-up voice .
palach died three days later , refusing pain medication until the end . suffering for a cause in his farewell letter , palach mentioned a group of people who had all decided to burn themselves as a political protest .
he was the first and there were more burnings in the weeks and months following . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague has seen many protests come and go , but palach wo n't be forgotten his act even spurred copycats as recently as in 2003 when a series of self-burnings as a form of protest broke out in the nation . palach 's burial was attended by artists , politicians and friends .
some 200,000 people took part in a funeral march for him through prague . " palach 's death was immediately understood by society , " vaclav havel , playwright and later president of czechoslovakia , said in an interview at the time .
" everyone wants to do something extreme when everything else is so helpless . " havel himself was arrested in 1989 for laying flowers by a statue in honor of the 20th anniversary of palach 's death . a hero for some " in his state of helplessness , he offered the only thing he had - his life , " said jakub trojan , the evangelical pastor at palach 's burial . the 40th anniversary of the young student 's act in downtown prague and his death are marked by numerous memorial events . as one czech university student recently told deutschlandfunk broadcaster , palch is viewed " as a hero , because he was prepared to sacrifice his life due to the political situation .
i can say that i 'm proud to be a student in the same faculty that he studied in . " palach 's life and death are also the subject of a 600-page book that has just been published . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i believe we can reach an agreement that will resolve the situation and lead to the transit of russian gas , " he said through an interpreter . merkel told reporters there might be a test phase where gas pumping was resumed under monitoring by european union inspectors . she said the inspectors would check the pipeline transit system to ensure that gas destined for western europe " does not disappear in ukraine . " " time is of the essence " despite a series of agreements , russian gas exports via ukraine remained cut off for the 10th day friday , leaving some european countries without sufficient fuel to heat homes and factories . " technical " gas is at the focus of the ongoing dispute because ukraine insists it has a right to remove 21 million cubic meters of gas daily to power the pumps whereas russia accuses the ukrainians of " stealing " the gas .
ukraine denies the accusation . " i think we will eventually find a solution , " said merkel , who appealed to both russia and the ukraine to return to the negotiating to end what was essentially a commercial dispute . " time is of the essence , " she said , adding that a settlement was also in the interests of russia and gazprom .
otherwise there would be a loss of confidence in them , she said . " last chance " to resolve the dispute putin earlier met executives of e.on ruhrgas of germany , eni of italy and gaz de france in a berlin hotel . the russian premier proposed that a western consortium pay for technical gas , which is removed from the pipeline to run the equipment that keep the remainder of the gas moving westwards . putin said the cost of the gas to power the pumps would be $ 730 million in the first quarter of this year alone .
he said that strictly speaking , it should be ukraine that paid to power the pumps . although germany is still receiving russian gas via belarus and has high stocks - 59 per cent of maximum storage capacity as of monday this week - it is pressing for a quick end to the kiev-moscow dispute . merkel phoned ukraine 's leaders on thursday , before her meeting with putin , who was paying his first visit to germany since leaving the russian presidency and becoming prime minister in may 2008 . the european union relies on russia for about 20 per cent of its natural gas .
germany , europe 's biggest economy , gets 37 per cent of its gas supplies from russia . putin is due to meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko for talks on energy in moscow on saturday .
on friday , senior officials from eastern europe gathered in kiev for a blitz energy summit . " the european commission believes that the meetings in the coming days offer the last and best chance for russia and ukraine to demonstrate they are serious about resolving this dispute , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said .

14 . lower saxony environment minister hans-heinrich sander said he was only informed of the damage to the storage site thursday , but the radiation office said the ministry had been informed all along . the bfs said it could not rule out damage to the waste containers should the asse site ceiling collapse , but gave its reassurances that it would reinforce the seals of the chamber with concrete to stop any radioactive dust or air escaping . precautionary step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the office says it will reinforce the chamber containing radioactive waste drums the office said the measures were only a precaution and that there was no immediate danger posed by the site .
it said the waste inside the chamber contained only " weak " levels of radioactivity . the site has not been used for fresh radioactive storage since 1978 , with environmental groups regularly calling for waste there to be removed and stored in a safer location . nuclear energy has been a contentious issue in germany for several decades .
a majority of germans oppose the construction of new nuclear plants because of what they believe to be the high risk of a terrorist attack . but with most industrialized nations seeking to lower their carbon footprint , nuclear power has received a fresh breath of life .
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative cdu party says turning back to nuclear could reduce germany 's dependence on russian gas and middle eastern oil . merkel 's party want to examine possible life extensions to some of germany 's 17 nuclear power stations .
not doing so , the party says , would undermine the country 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the united states carries the responsibility for the people who have been in guantanamo for years now , " schaeuble said on thursday , jan .

closing the facility in guantanamo bay , cuba means that a portion of the remaining 248 prisoners will have to be transferred to other countries . schaeuble also pointed out that , as far as he is aware , none of the remaining guantanamo inmates are germans nor are any of them citizens who grew up in germany . the number of inmates left " is not a number that is unbelievably high , and the us is not a small country , " he added . the question of what to do with the guantanamo bay prisoners has caused controversy outside of germany as well , as several eu countries are at odds over the matter . guantanamo source of eu conflict austria and france voiced their stance against receiving inmates at the eu interior ministers meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates have never been tried , a fact that has sparked human rights debates " america created guantanamo .
it has to come up with the solution , " austrian interior minister maria fekter told reporters on the sidelines of the prague meeting . the french foreign ministry , however , said it was " open " to receiving guantanamo inmates who face persecution in their home countries .
according to a spokesperson for the ministry , french foreign minister bernard kouchner wants to " review the matter favorably . " kouchner 's stance clearly illustrates the widespread conflict between eu interior ministers and their foreign ministry counterparts . the netherlands has ruled out accepting any newly freed inmates , while portugal has said it might do so .
sweden has said guantanamo bay is washington 's responsibility and , according to media reports , denmark will refuse any us request to take in prisoners .

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the united states carries the responsibility for the people who have been in guantanamo for years now , " schaeuble said on thursday , jan .

closing the facility in guantanamo bay , cuba means that a portion of the remaining 248 prisoners will have to be transferred to other countries . schaeuble also pointed out that , as far as he is aware , none of the remaining guantanamo inmates are germans nor are any of them citizens who grew up in germany . the number of inmates left " is not a number that is unbelievably high , and the us is not a small country , " he added . the question of what to do with the guantanamo bay prisoners has caused controversy outside of germany as well , as several eu countries are at odds over the matter . guantanamo source of eu conflict austria and france voiced their stance against receiving inmates at the eu interior ministers meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates have never been tried , a fact that has sparked human rights debates " america created guantanamo .
it has to come up with the solution , " austrian interior minister maria fekter told reporters on the sidelines of the prague meeting . the french foreign ministry , however , said it was " open " to receiving guantanamo inmates who face persecution in their home countries .
according to a spokesperson for the ministry , french foreign minister bernard kouchner wants to " review the matter favorably . " kouchner 's stance clearly illustrates the widespread conflict between eu interior ministers and their foreign ministry counterparts . the netherlands has ruled out accepting any newly freed inmates , while portugal has said it might do so .
sweden has said guantanamo bay is washington 's responsibility and , according to media reports , denmark will refuse any us request to take in prisoners .

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately . "
a deteriorating energy situation caused by gas shortages was particularly grim in moldova .
there was no hot water throughout the former soviet republic , and major industrial plants remained idle .
residential heating was minimal with fuel-short central heating plants struggling to bring sufficient warmth to radiators .
" all of this has gone for too long , " laitenberger of the eu commission said .
the eu relies on russian gas via ukraine for around a fifth of its supplies , mostly via ukraine .
germany , europe 's largest economy , is even more dependent , with moscow supplying 37 percent of its needs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .
negotiations underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni has been holding talks with western leaders at the same as livni met with rice in washington , israeli negotiator , amos gilad , was returning to egypt friday with instructions from caretaker prime minister ehud olmert , defence minister ehud barak and livni .
only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .
negotiations underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni has been holding talks with western leaders at the same as livni met with rice in washington , israeli negotiator , amos gilad , was returning to egypt friday with instructions from caretaker prime minister ehud olmert , defence minister ehud barak and livni .
only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i believe we can reach an agreement that will resolve the situation and lead to the transit of russian gas , " he said through an interpreter . merkel told reporters there might be a test phase where gas pumping was resumed under monitoring by european union inspectors . she said the inspectors would check the pipeline transit system to ensure that gas destined for western europe " does not disappear in ukraine . " " time is of the essence " despite a series of agreements , russian gas exports via ukraine remained cut off for the 10th day friday , leaving some european countries without sufficient fuel to heat homes and factories . " technical " gas is at the focus of the ongoing dispute because ukraine insists it has a right to remove 21 million cubic meters of gas daily to power the pumps whereas russia accuses the ukrainians of " stealing " the gas .
ukraine denies the accusation . " i think we will eventually find a solution , " said merkel , who appealed to both russia and the ukraine to return to the negotiating to end what was essentially a commercial dispute . " time is of the essence , " she said , adding that a settlement was also in the interests of russia and gazprom .
otherwise there would be a loss of confidence in them , she said . " last chance " to resolve the dispute putin earlier met executives of e.on ruhrgas of germany , eni of italy and gaz de france in a berlin hotel . the russian premier proposed that a western consortium pay for technical gas , which is removed from the pipeline to run the equipment that keep the remainder of the gas moving westwards . putin said the cost of the gas to power the pumps would be $ 730 million in the first quarter of this year alone .
he said that strictly speaking , it should be ukraine that paid to power the pumps . although germany is still receiving russian gas via belarus and has high stocks - 59 per cent of maximum storage capacity as of monday this week - it is pressing for a quick end to the kiev-moscow dispute . merkel phoned ukraine 's leaders on thursday , before her meeting with putin , who was paying his first visit to germany since leaving the russian presidency and becoming prime minister in may 2008 . the european union relies on russia for about 20 per cent of its natural gas .

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately . "
a deteriorating energy situation caused by gas shortages was particularly grim in moldova .
there was no hot water throughout the former soviet republic , and major industrial plants remained idle .
residential heating was minimal with fuel-short central heating plants struggling to bring sufficient warmth to radiators .
" all of this has gone for too long , " laitenberger of the eu commission said .

" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately .

a deteriorating energy situation caused by gas shortages was particularly grim in moldova .
there was no hot water throughout the former soviet republic , and major industrial plants remained idle .
residential heating was minimal with fuel-short central heating plants struggling to bring sufficient warmth to radiators .
" all of this has gone for too long , " laitenberger of the eu commission said .

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .
negotiations underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni has been holding talks with western leaders at the same as livni met with rice in washington , israeli negotiator , amos gilad , was returning to egypt friday with instructions from caretaker prime minister ehud olmert , defence minister ehud barak and livni .
only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a special forum will concentrate on food supplies in a growing world . the international green week -lrb- igw -rrb- , the world 's largest exhibition for the food industry , agriculture and horticulture , opens its doors on friday , jan .
16 in berlin .
in light of the current economic climate , this year 's igw will be considered an indicator for investment and spending trends in the coming months .
the food and agriculture industries said they had mixed feelings going into the fair .
gerd sonnleitner , head of the german farmers ' union dbv , said the economic crisis was battering farmers .
" but we 're producing food that is also needed in times of economic crisis , " sonnleitner said at the igw opening press conference .
the chances were good that farmers would continue their work successfully .
the head of the bve food industry federation juergen abraham said consumers would benefit from price pressures on the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green week is about more than just culinary delights and cows " the price increases in food appear to have ceased , " abraham told reporters .
organic food sector untouched by crisis one area that is not suffering at all from the economic downturn is the organic food sector .
" the financial crisis only has little direct impact on the organic food sector , " said thomas dosch , head of germany 's largest organic farmers ' association , bioland .
the organic sector continued to develop positively and " the interest of farmers to switch -lrb- to organics -rrb- is growing , " he said .
in 2008 , sales related to organic food were up by some 10 percent to 5.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- , the federation of the organic food sector bolw said .
despite higher prices , consumers did not want to do without organic food , bolw said .
forum offers platform for global dialogue the international green week forum -lrb- figw -rrb- is also taking place parallel to the trade fair .
it will be offering conferences , workshops and discussions on major issues concerning world food supplies .
this year 's forum is focusing on global food security .
" ensuring the food security of a growing world population in the face of limited natural resources is currently one of the key challenges of the future facing mankind , " said germany 's agriculture minister ilse aigner in a welcome address on the figw web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green week has existed since 1926 " in the light of population growth and the fight against poverty , the challenge now is to raise the supply of agricultural products by increasing productivity in the farming sector , " aigner said .
around 30 agriculture ministers are expected to attend the forum with leading representatives from the agriculture and food industries .
these include russia 's alexej gordejev , chinese vice-minister for agriculture chen xiao hua , india 's sharad pawar , tefera deribew of ethiopia and brazil 's former agriculture minister roberto rodrigues .
messe berlin , which organizes the trade fair , said this year 's igw was a milestone in the fair 's history since its debut in 1926 .
" never before have the leading representatives of every stage in the value-added chain of agri-business been able to engage in such high level discussions and on such a global scale with agricultural policymakers on issues of vital importance to the future of humankind , " said christian goeke , messe berlin 's chief operating officer .

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately . "
a deteriorating energy situation caused by gas shortages was particularly grim in moldova .
there was no hot water throughout the former soviet republic , and major industrial plants remained idle .
residential heating was minimal with fuel-short central heating plants struggling to bring sufficient warmth to radiators .
" all of this has gone for too long , " laitenberger of the eu commission said .
the eu relies on russian gas via ukraine for around a fifth of its supplies , mostly via ukraine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 16.01.2009 european leaders seek more help for car industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is vital to both germany and the european union european union governments agreed on friday to step up aid for their struggling carmakers but called for a coordinated response to avoid a race for subsidies among the bloc 's 27 nations . european union industry ministers met in brussels on friday to find ways of supporting their troubled car industries amid calls for up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.2 billion -rrb- in credit from the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- .
eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 . lower saxony environment minister hans-heinrich sander said he was only informed of the damage to the storage site thursday , but the radiation office said the ministry had been informed all along . the bfs said it could not rule out damage to the waste containers should the asse site ceiling collapse , but gave its reassurances that it would reinforce the seals of the chamber with concrete to stop any radioactive dust or air escaping . precautionary step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the office says it will reinforce the chamber containing radioactive waste drums the office said the measures were only a precaution and that there was no immediate danger posed by the site .
it said the waste inside the chamber contained only " weak " levels of radioactivity . the site has not been used for fresh radioactive storage since 1978 , with environmental groups regularly calling for waste there to be removed and stored in a safer location . nuclear energy has been a contentious issue in germany for several decades .
a majority of germans oppose the construction of new nuclear plants because of what they believe to be the high risk of a terrorist attack . but with most industrialized nations seeking to lower their carbon footprint , nuclear power has received a fresh breath of life .
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative cdu party says turning back to nuclear could reduce germany 's dependence on russian gas and middle eastern oil . merkel 's party want to examine possible life extensions to some of germany 's 17 nuclear power stations .
not doing so , the party says , would undermine the country 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or perhaps the honest debt collector , just doing his job , albeit with a pair of knuckledusters . and many germans were n't particularly turned on by sex shop workers - who 'd presumably have extensive knowledge in the field . also to make the top 10 were tax collectors , bailiffs , garbage collectors , undertakers , slaughterhouse workers - and teachers . germany-based pollster and researcher forsa released the survey results friday , jan .

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the united states carries the responsibility for the people who have been in guantanamo for years now , " schaeuble said on thursday , jan .

closing the facility in guantanamo bay , cuba means that a portion of the remaining 248 prisoners will have to be transferred to other countries . schaeuble also pointed out that , as far as he is aware , none of the remaining guantanamo inmates are germans nor are any of them citizens who grew up in germany . the number of inmates left " is not a number that is unbelievably high , and the us is not a small country , " he added . the question of what to do with the guantanamo bay prisoners has caused controversy outside of germany as well , as several eu countries are at odds over the matter . guantanamo source of eu conflict austria and france voiced their stance against receiving inmates at the eu interior ministers meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates have never been tried , a fact that has sparked human rights debates " america created guantanamo .
it has to come up with the solution , " austrian interior minister maria fekter told reporters on the sidelines of the prague meeting . the french foreign ministry , however , said it was " open " to receiving guantanamo inmates who face persecution in their home countries .
according to a spokesperson for the ministry , french foreign minister bernard kouchner wants to " review the matter favorably . " kouchner 's stance clearly illustrates the widespread conflict between eu interior ministers and their foreign ministry counterparts . the netherlands has ruled out accepting any newly freed inmates , while portugal has said it might do so .
sweden has said guantanamo bay is washington 's responsibility and , according to media reports , denmark will refuse any us request to take in prisoners .
poland has expressed doubts whether it can deal with the type of prisoners being held . eu foreign ministers will discuss the problem at talks in brussels on jan .

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .

it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.01.2009 germany blasts geo-engineering scheme in atlantic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polarstern is germany 's most famous research vessel after international outcry from governments and envrionmental groups , germany has postponed an experiment in the south atlantic which could potentially pull massive amounts of carbon out of the air . a german research vessel charged with carrying out an experiment involving the dumping of six tons of iron sulfate into the ocean off the coast of antarctica has been ordered to halt the test until further assessments can be conducted .
the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i believe we can reach an agreement that will resolve the situation and lead to the transit of russian gas , " he said through an interpreter . merkel told reporters there might be a test phase where gas pumping was resumed under monitoring by european union inspectors . she said the inspectors would check the pipeline transit system to ensure that gas destined for western europe " does not disappear in ukraine . " " time is of the essence " despite a series of agreements , russian gas exports via ukraine remained cut off for the 10th day friday , leaving some european countries without sufficient fuel to heat homes and factories . " technical " gas is at the focus of the ongoing dispute because ukraine insists it has a right to remove 21 million cubic meters of gas daily to power the pumps whereas russia accuses the ukrainians of " stealing " the gas .
ukraine denies the accusation . " i think we will eventually find a solution , " said merkel , who appealed to both russia and the ukraine to return to the negotiating to end what was essentially a commercial dispute . " time is of the essence , " she said , adding that a settlement was also in the interests of russia and gazprom .
otherwise there would be a loss of confidence in them , she said . " last chance " to resolve the dispute putin earlier met executives of e.on ruhrgas of germany , eni of italy and gaz de france in a berlin hotel . the russian premier proposed that a western consortium pay for technical gas , which is removed from the pipeline to run the equipment that keep the remainder of the gas moving westwards . putin said the cost of the gas to power the pumps would be $ 730 million in the first quarter of this year alone .
he said that strictly speaking , it should be ukraine that paid to power the pumps . although germany is still receiving russian gas via belarus and has high stocks - 59 per cent of maximum storage capacity as of monday this week - it is pressing for a quick end to the kiev-moscow dispute . merkel phoned ukraine 's leaders on thursday , before her meeting with putin , who was paying his first visit to germany since leaving the russian presidency and becoming prime minister in may 2008 . the european union relies on russia for about 20 per cent of its natural gas .
germany , europe 's biggest economy , gets 37 per cent of its gas supplies from russia . putin is due to meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko for talks on energy in moscow on saturday .
on friday , senior officials from eastern europe gathered in kiev for a blitz energy summit . " the european commission believes that the meetings in the coming days offer the last and best chance for russia and ukraine to demonstrate they are serious about resolving this dispute , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said .
" the gas must flow .
we will regard this period as a test case for judging whether or not they are credible partners . " controversy in dresden following his talks with merkel , putin travelled to the eastern city of dresden to pick up an award for promoting russo-german cultural relations . a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , said putin did not deserve the honor because of atrocities committed by russian troops in chechnya during his time as president . putin served as a soviet kgb officer in dresden until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 . lower saxony environment minister hans-heinrich sander said he was only informed of the damage to the storage site thursday , but the radiation office said the ministry had been informed all along . the bfs said it could not rule out damage to the waste containers should the asse site ceiling collapse , but gave its reassurances that it would reinforce the seals of the chamber with concrete to stop any radioactive dust or air escaping . precautionary step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the office says it will reinforce the chamber containing radioactive waste drums the office said the measures were only a precaution and that there was no immediate danger posed by the site .
it said the waste inside the chamber contained only " weak " levels of radioactivity . the site has not been used for fresh radioactive storage since 1978 , with environmental groups regularly calling for waste there to be removed and stored in a safer location . nuclear energy has been a contentious issue in germany for several decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.01.2009 merkel says gas feud risks undermining russia 's credibility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hosting putin in berlin ahead of an emergency summit in moscow at talks friday in berlin , german chancellor merkel is to urge russian prime minister vladimir putin to renew gas deliveries to europe via ukraine .
merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately . "
a deteriorating energy situation caused by gas shortages was particularly grim in moldova .
there was no hot water throughout the former soviet republic , and major industrial plants remained idle .
residential heating was minimal with fuel-short central heating plants struggling to bring sufficient warmth to radiators .
" all of this has gone for too long , " laitenberger of the eu commission said .
the eu relies on russian gas via ukraine for around a fifth of its supplies , mostly via ukraine .
germany , europe 's largest economy , is even more dependent , with moscow supplying 37 percent of its needs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 . lower saxony environment minister hans-heinrich sander said he was only informed of the damage to the storage site thursday , but the radiation office said the ministry had been informed all along . the bfs said it could not rule out damage to the waste containers should the asse site ceiling collapse , but gave its reassurances that it would reinforce the seals of the chamber with concrete to stop any radioactive dust or air escaping . precautionary step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the office says it will reinforce the chamber containing radioactive waste drums the office said the measures were only a precaution and that there was no immediate danger posed by the site .
it said the waste inside the chamber contained only " weak " levels of radioactivity . the site has not been used for fresh radioactive storage since 1978 , with environmental groups regularly calling for waste there to be removed and stored in a safer location . nuclear energy has been a contentious issue in germany for several decades .
a majority of germans oppose the construction of new nuclear plants because of what they believe to be the high risk of a terrorist attack . but with most industrialized nations seeking to lower their carbon footprint , nuclear power has received a fresh breath of life .
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative cdu party says turning back to nuclear could reduce germany 's dependence on russian gas and middle eastern oil . merkel 's party want to examine possible life extensions to some of germany 's 17 nuclear power stations .
not doing so , the party says , would undermine the country 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , home to europe 's second-largest muslim community , calls are growing to end the bloodshed and spare civilian lives . pro-israeli and pro-palestinian groups have long feuded over who holds the moral high-ground in this ongoing conflict , but consensus is widespread that non-combatants in gaza are paying the price for the inability of hamas and israel to negotiate a peace to this most recent outbreak of violence . in germany , which has western europe 's second-largest muslim population after france , many in the muslim community see hamas as the instigator in this recent episode but are calling for an end to the israeli offensive for the sake of palestinian civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many civilians have been caught up in the gaza war willy ibrahimbegov , 24 , a german muslim whose family emigrated from bosnia in 1989 , said the israeli offensive has been disproportionate when compared with hamas rocket attacks . " i 'm angry because it 's not fair what 's going on , " he said .
" it 's clear that hamas started the war again , but you can not compare ten rockets to what israel is doing .
and you can not compare two israeli lives with a thousand lives in palestine .
these are lives of innocent people , " he said . ibrahimbegov warned that a rising death toll would further stoke palestinian anger , pushing the people in the gaza strip into the arms of hamas . " more and more people will support hamas in palestine because most people there want revenge , " he said . violence not the solution irawati sulamet , 59 , who was born and raised in the world 's most populous muslim nation , indonesia , but has resided in germany for the last 30 years , agreed that israel was provoked into attacking hamas targets , but that the offensive has now gone on too long . " it is hamas who is to blame for the recent hostilities , " she said .
" but the israeli offensive has gone too far now , " she said . most of those interviewed said that war was not the answer to the region 's complex problems . " hamas and the israelis must sit with international representatives and come to peace .
it does n't matter who fired first , " said burak tatlioglu , 53 , a muslim who immigrated to germany from turkey in 1993 and now lives in bonn . jewish groups : hamas to blame for deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe-wide protests have been held to support israel 's right to strike hamas the central council of jews in germany has placed the blame for the recent conflict squarely on hamas and asserted the right of the jewish state to go on the offensive . " the defense of -lrb- israeli -rrb- citizens is not aggression and also not a violation of human rights .
israel has to protect the rights of and its obligation to its citizens , " said president charlotte knobloch on the council 's web site . " hamas carries the exclusive responsibility of civilian casualties on both sides , " she said . the european jewish congress also supported israel 's right to launch an assault in the gaza strip and organized pro-israel demonstrations in berlin , frankfurt and munich over the weekend , which attracted around 2,000 protestors . plea for civilians some muslim organizations in germany , such as the turkish islamic union of the institute of religion -lrb- ditib -rrb- , have avoided playing the blame game and have called simply for an end to hostilities for the sake of civilians in gaza . " we are convinced of the fact that wars , hate and conflict do not bear a solution , but only human misery and pain .
we appeal here to reason and the sense of responsibility of those involved , " said sadi arslan , chairman of the ditib . arslan said both israel and hamas had to return to the negotiating table to find a solution . " a reciprocal renouncement of acts of violence , provocations and law breaking , as well as dialogue between both parties mediated by the world community , is the best way out of this intolerable situation in gaza , " he said . muslim group : hamas , israel both aggressors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-gaza demonstrations have been held all over the world the central council of muslims in germany said israel 's actions violated the principles of international law .
but , he said , hamas too had to end its rocket fire on israeli settlements if a lasting peace was to be found . " the bombardment of mosques , parliament buildings , schools and university mechanisms and many public places -lrb- by israel -rrb- are a condition which can not be accepted and which must be stopped immediately , " said the council 's spokesman erol puerlue . but puerlue also called for an end to hamas rocket attacks on parts of southern israel .

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .
negotiations underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni has been holding talks with western leaders at the same as livni met with rice in washington , israeli negotiator , amos gilad , was returning to egypt friday with instructions from caretaker prime minister ehud olmert , defence minister ehud barak and livni .
only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , home to europe 's second-largest muslim community , calls are growing to end the bloodshed and spare civilian lives . pro-israeli and pro-palestinian groups have long feuded over who holds the moral high-ground in this ongoing conflict , but consensus is widespread that non-combatants in gaza are paying the price for the inability of hamas and israel to negotiate a peace to this most recent outbreak of violence . in germany , which has western europe 's second-largest muslim population after france , many in the muslim community see hamas as the instigator in this recent episode but are calling for an end to the israeli offensive for the sake of palestinian civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many civilians have been caught up in the gaza war willy ibrahimbegov , 24 , a german muslim whose family emigrated from bosnia in 1989 , said the israeli offensive has been disproportionate when compared with hamas rocket attacks . " i 'm angry because it 's not fair what 's going on , " he said .
" it 's clear that hamas started the war again , but you can not compare ten rockets to what israel is doing .
and you can not compare two israeli lives with a thousand lives in palestine .
these are lives of innocent people , " he said . ibrahimbegov warned that a rising death toll would further stoke palestinian anger , pushing the people in the gaza strip into the arms of hamas . " more and more people will support hamas in palestine because most people there want revenge , " he said . violence not the solution irawati sulamet , 59 , who was born and raised in the world 's most populous muslim nation , indonesia , but has resided in germany for the last 30 years , agreed that israel was provoked into attacking hamas targets , but that the offensive has now gone on too long . " it is hamas who is to blame for the recent hostilities , " she said .
" but the israeli offensive has gone too far now , " she said . most of those interviewed said that war was not the answer to the region 's complex problems . " hamas and the israelis must sit with international representatives and come to peace .
it does n't matter who fired first , " said burak tatlioglu , 53 , a muslim who immigrated to germany from turkey in 1993 and now lives in bonn . jewish groups : hamas to blame for deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe-wide protests have been held to support israel 's right to strike hamas the central council of jews in germany has placed the blame for the recent conflict squarely on hamas and asserted the right of the jewish state to go on the offensive . " the defense of -lrb- israeli -rrb- citizens is not aggression and also not a violation of human rights .
israel has to protect the rights of and its obligation to its citizens , " said president charlotte knobloch on the council 's web site . " hamas carries the exclusive responsibility of civilian casualties on both sides , " she said . the european jewish congress also supported israel 's right to launch an assault in the gaza strip and organized pro-israel demonstrations in berlin , frankfurt and munich over the weekend , which attracted around 2,000 protestors . plea for civilians some muslim organizations in germany , such as the turkish islamic union of the institute of religion -lrb- ditib -rrb- , have avoided playing the blame game and have called simply for an end to hostilities for the sake of civilians in gaza . " we are convinced of the fact that wars , hate and conflict do not bear a solution , but only human misery and pain .
we appeal here to reason and the sense of responsibility of those involved , " said sadi arslan , chairman of the ditib . arslan said both israel and hamas had to return to the negotiating table to find a solution . " a reciprocal renouncement of acts of violence , provocations and law breaking , as well as dialogue between both parties mediated by the world community , is the best way out of this intolerable situation in gaza , " he said . muslim group : hamas , israel both aggressors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-gaza demonstrations have been held all over the world the central council of muslims in germany said israel 's actions violated the principles of international law .
but , he said , hamas too had to end its rocket fire on israeli settlements if a lasting peace was to be found . " the bombardment of mosques , parliament buildings , schools and university mechanisms and many public places -lrb- by israel -rrb- are a condition which can not be accepted and which must be stopped immediately , " said the council 's spokesman erol puerlue . but puerlue also called for an end to hamas rocket attacks on parts of southern israel .

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 . lower saxony environment minister hans-heinrich sander said he was only informed of the damage to the storage site thursday , but the radiation office said the ministry had been informed all along . the bfs said it could not rule out damage to the waste containers should the asse site ceiling collapse , but gave its reassurances that it would reinforce the seals of the chamber with concrete to stop any radioactive dust or air escaping . precautionary step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the office says it will reinforce the chamber containing radioactive waste drums the office said the measures were only a precaution and that there was no immediate danger posed by the site .
it said the waste inside the chamber contained only " weak " levels of radioactivity . the site has not been used for fresh radioactive storage since 1978 , with environmental groups regularly calling for waste there to be removed and stored in a safer location . nuclear energy has been a contentious issue in germany for several decades .
a majority of germans oppose the construction of new nuclear plants because of what they believe to be the high risk of a terrorist attack . but with most industrialized nations seeking to lower their carbon footprint , nuclear power has received a fresh breath of life .
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative cdu party says turning back to nuclear could reduce germany 's dependence on russian gas and middle eastern oil . merkel 's party want to examine possible life extensions to some of germany 's 17 nuclear power stations .
not doing so , the party says , would undermine the country 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .
negotiations underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni has been holding talks with western leaders at the same as livni met with rice in washington , israeli negotiator , amos gilad , was returning to egypt friday with instructions from caretaker prime minister ehud olmert , defence minister ehud barak and livni .
only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.01.2009 germany blasts geo-engineering scheme in atlantic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polarstern is germany 's most famous research vessel after international outcry from governments and envrionmental groups , germany has postponed an experiment in the south atlantic which could potentially pull massive amounts of carbon out of the air . a german research vessel charged with carrying out an experiment involving the dumping of six tons of iron sulfate into the ocean off the coast of antarctica has been ordered to halt the test until further assessments can be conducted .
the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 16.01.2009 european leaders seek more help for car industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is vital to both germany and the european union european union governments agreed on friday to step up aid for their struggling carmakers but called for a coordinated response to avoid a race for subsidies among the bloc 's 27 nations . european union industry ministers met in brussels on friday to find ways of supporting their troubled car industries amid calls for up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.2 billion -rrb- in credit from the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- .
eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or perhaps the honest debt collector , just doing his job , albeit with a pair of knuckledusters . and many germans were n't particularly turned on by sex shop workers - who 'd presumably have extensive knowledge in the field . also to make the top 10 were tax collectors , bailiffs , garbage collectors , undertakers , slaughterhouse workers - and teachers . germany-based pollster and researcher forsa released the survey results friday , jan .

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , home to europe 's second-largest muslim community , calls are growing to end the bloodshed and spare civilian lives . pro-israeli and pro-palestinian groups have long feuded over who holds the moral high-ground in this ongoing conflict , but consensus is widespread that non-combatants in gaza are paying the price for the inability of hamas and israel to negotiate a peace to this most recent outbreak of violence . in germany , which has western europe 's second-largest muslim population after france , many in the muslim community see hamas as the instigator in this recent episode but are calling for an end to the israeli offensive for the sake of palestinian civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many civilians have been caught up in the gaza war willy ibrahimbegov , 24 , a german muslim whose family emigrated from bosnia in 1989 , said the israeli offensive has been disproportionate when compared with hamas rocket attacks . " i 'm angry because it 's not fair what 's going on , " he said .
" it 's clear that hamas started the war again , but you can not compare ten rockets to what israel is doing .
and you can not compare two israeli lives with a thousand lives in palestine .
these are lives of innocent people , " he said . ibrahimbegov warned that a rising death toll would further stoke palestinian anger , pushing the people in the gaza strip into the arms of hamas . " more and more people will support hamas in palestine because most people there want revenge , " he said . violence not the solution irawati sulamet , 59 , who was born and raised in the world 's most populous muslim nation , indonesia , but has resided in germany for the last 30 years , agreed that israel was provoked into attacking hamas targets , but that the offensive has now gone on too long . " it is hamas who is to blame for the recent hostilities , " she said .
" but the israeli offensive has gone too far now , " she said . most of those interviewed said that war was not the answer to the region 's complex problems . " hamas and the israelis must sit with international representatives and come to peace .
it does n't matter who fired first , " said burak tatlioglu , 53 , a muslim who immigrated to germany from turkey in 1993 and now lives in bonn . jewish groups : hamas to blame for deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe-wide protests have been held to support israel 's right to strike hamas the central council of jews in germany has placed the blame for the recent conflict squarely on hamas and asserted the right of the jewish state to go on the offensive . " the defense of -lrb- israeli -rrb- citizens is not aggression and also not a violation of human rights .
israel has to protect the rights of and its obligation to its citizens , " said president charlotte knobloch on the council 's web site . " hamas carries the exclusive responsibility of civilian casualties on both sides , " she said . the european jewish congress also supported israel 's right to launch an assault in the gaza strip and organized pro-israel demonstrations in berlin , frankfurt and munich over the weekend , which attracted around 2,000 protestors . plea for civilians some muslim organizations in germany , such as the turkish islamic union of the institute of religion -lrb- ditib -rrb- , have avoided playing the blame game and have called simply for an end to hostilities for the sake of civilians in gaza . " we are convinced of the fact that wars , hate and conflict do not bear a solution , but only human misery and pain .
we appeal here to reason and the sense of responsibility of those involved , " said sadi arslan , chairman of the ditib . arslan said both israel and hamas had to return to the negotiating table to find a solution . " a reciprocal renouncement of acts of violence , provocations and law breaking , as well as dialogue between both parties mediated by the world community , is the best way out of this intolerable situation in gaza , " he said . muslim group : hamas , israel both aggressors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-gaza demonstrations have been held all over the world the central council of muslims in germany said israel 's actions violated the principles of international law .
but , he said , hamas too had to end its rocket fire on israeli settlements if a lasting peace was to be found . " the bombardment of mosques , parliament buildings , schools and university mechanisms and many public places -lrb- by israel -rrb- are a condition which can not be accepted and which must be stopped immediately , " said the council 's spokesman erol puerlue . but puerlue also called for an end to hamas rocket attacks on parts of southern israel .

now russian prime minster vladimir putin is being honored by the city , provoking criticism from human rights groups . a human rights group criticized plans by a german cultural organization to present an award to russian prime minister vladimir putin in the eastern city of dresden on friday .
" he does n't deserve to be honored , " the german-based society for threatened peoples said , blaming putin for human rights violations by russian troops in chechnya .
during his time as president , the russian leader was responsible for the deaths of around 80,000 men , women and children in the breakaway republic , the society said in a statement .
order of saxon gratitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin will be awarded the " order of saxon gratitude " at a black-tie debutantes ' ball at the semper opera house putin , who served as head of state from 1999 until becoming prime minister last year , was due to receive the " order of saxon gratitude " for promoting cultural relations between germany and russia .
the honor was to be presented by the semper opera ball association in dresden , where putin served as soviet kgb officer until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the russian prime minister was due to receive the award after holding talks with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he was also paying a visit to the green week agricultural exhibition .
east german groups join the fray two former east german civil rights activists joined in the criticism of the plan to honor putin .
werner schulz told the newspaper leipziger volkszeitung that shortly before the fall of the wall , putin threatened to open fire on east german dissidents if they approached kgb headquarters in dresden .
heinz eggert , a former interior minister in the state of saxony , where dresden is located , said that if it were not for the anti- communist uprising , putin " would still be an anonymous kgb officer who would n't have the money to buy a ticket for the opera ball .

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .

france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .

to many , he is still a hero . it was the most drastic protest against the soviet-led invasion which crushed the communist reform movement - the so-called prague spring in 1968 . at 2:30 in the afternoon on jan .
16 , 1969 , 20-year-old university student jan palach poured gasoline over himself in wenceslas square and set himself on fire .
his self-immolation is viewed as a symbol of the despair felt by the people in czechoslovakia under moscow 's oppressive hand . a streetcar worker was the first to react to the flames and used his coat to cover palach and extinguish the flames .
the philosophy student was taken to hospital , where his first words were reportedly : " i 'm not committing suicide ! " covered in burns , he was interviewed by a psychiatrist who worked for the czechoslovakian secret police .
the doctor asked palach if he was in pain .
" enough , " he said .
" people have to fight against evil when they can , " he continued in a choked-up voice .
palach died three days later , refusing pain medication until the end . suffering for a cause in his farewell letter , palach mentioned a group of people who had all decided to burn themselves as a political protest .
he was the first and there were more burnings in the weeks and months following . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague has seen many protests come and go , but palach wo n't be forgotten his act even spurred copycats as recently as in 2003 when a series of self-burnings as a form of protest broke out in the nation . palach 's burial was attended by artists , politicians and friends .
some 200,000 people took part in a funeral march for him through prague . " palach 's death was immediately understood by society , " vaclav havel , playwright and later president of czechoslovakia , said in an interview at the time .
" everyone wants to do something extreme when everything else is so helpless .

to many , he is still a hero . it was the most drastic protest against the soviet-led invasion which crushed the communist reform movement - the so-called prague spring in 1968 . at 2:30 in the afternoon on jan .
16 , 1969 , 20-year-old university student jan palach poured gasoline over himself in wenceslas square and set himself on fire .
his self-immolation is viewed as a symbol of the despair felt by the people in czechoslovakia under moscow 's oppressive hand . a streetcar worker was the first to react to the flames and used his coat to cover palach and extinguish the flames .
the philosophy student was taken to hospital , where his first words were reportedly : " i 'm not committing suicide ! " covered in burns , he was interviewed by a psychiatrist who worked for the czechoslovakian secret police .
the doctor asked palach if he was in pain .
" enough , " he said .
" people have to fight against evil when they can , " he continued in a choked-up voice .
palach died three days later , refusing pain medication until the end . suffering for a cause in his farewell letter , palach mentioned a group of people who had all decided to burn themselves as a political protest .
he was the first and there were more burnings in the weeks and months following . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague has seen many protests come and go , but palach wo n't be forgotten his act even spurred copycats as recently as in 2003 when a series of self-burnings as a form of protest broke out in the nation . palach 's burial was attended by artists , politicians and friends .
some 200,000 people took part in a funeral march for him through prague . " palach 's death was immediately understood by society , " vaclav havel , playwright and later president of czechoslovakia , said in an interview at the time .
" everyone wants to do something extreme when everything else is so helpless . " havel himself was arrested in 1989 for laying flowers by a statue in honor of the 20th anniversary of palach 's death . a hero for some " in his state of helplessness , he offered the only thing he had - his life , " said jakub trojan , the evangelical pastor at palach 's burial . the 40th anniversary of the young student 's act in downtown prague and his death are marked by numerous memorial events . as one czech university student recently told deutschlandfunk broadcaster , palch is viewed " as a hero , because he was prepared to sacrifice his life due to the political situation .

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .

those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .

a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .

hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .
negotiations underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni has been holding talks with western leaders at the same as livni met with rice in washington , israeli negotiator , amos gilad , was returning to egypt friday with instructions from caretaker prime minister ehud olmert , defence minister ehud barak and livni .
only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now russian prime minster vladimir putin is being honored by the city , provoking criticism from human rights groups . a human rights group criticized plans by a german cultural organization to present an award to russian prime minister vladimir putin in the eastern city of dresden on friday .
" he does n't deserve to be honored , " the german-based society for threatened peoples said , blaming putin for human rights violations by russian troops in chechnya .
during his time as president , the russian leader was responsible for the deaths of around 80,000 men , women and children in the breakaway republic , the society said in a statement .
order of saxon gratitude bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin will be awarded the " order of saxon gratitude " at a black-tie debutantes ' ball at the semper opera house putin , who served as head of state from 1999 until becoming prime minister last year , was due to receive the " order of saxon gratitude " for promoting cultural relations between germany and russia .
the honor was to be presented by the semper opera ball association in dresden , where putin served as soviet kgb officer until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the russian prime minister was due to receive the award after holding talks with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , where he was also paying a visit to the green week agricultural exhibition .
east german groups join the fray two former east german civil rights activists joined in the criticism of the plan to honor putin .
werner schulz told the newspaper leipziger volkszeitung that shortly before the fall of the wall , putin threatened to open fire on east german dissidents if they approached kgb headquarters in dresden .

or perhaps the honest debt collector , just doing his job , albeit with a pair of knuckledusters . and many germans were n't particularly turned on by sex shop workers - who 'd presumably have extensive knowledge in the field . also to make the top 10 were tax collectors , bailiffs , garbage collectors , undertakers , slaughterhouse workers - and teachers . germany-based pollster and researcher forsa released the survey results friday , jan .

in germany , home to europe 's second-largest muslim community , calls are growing to end the bloodshed and spare civilian lives . pro-israeli and pro-palestinian groups have long feuded over who holds the moral high-ground in this ongoing conflict , but consensus is widespread that non-combatants in gaza are paying the price for the inability of hamas and israel to negotiate a peace to this most recent outbreak of violence . in germany , which has western europe 's second-largest muslim population after france , many in the muslim community see hamas as the instigator in this recent episode but are calling for an end to the israeli offensive for the sake of palestinian civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many civilians have been caught up in the gaza war willy ibrahimbegov , 24 , a german muslim whose family emigrated from bosnia in 1989 , said the israeli offensive has been disproportionate when compared with hamas rocket attacks . " i 'm angry because it 's not fair what 's going on , " he said .
" it 's clear that hamas started the war again , but you can not compare ten rockets to what israel is doing .
and you can not compare two israeli lives with a thousand lives in palestine .
these are lives of innocent people , " he said . ibrahimbegov warned that a rising death toll would further stoke palestinian anger , pushing the people in the gaza strip into the arms of hamas . " more and more people will support hamas in palestine because most people there want revenge , " he said . violence not the solution irawati sulamet , 59 , who was born and raised in the world 's most populous muslim nation , indonesia , but has resided in germany for the last 30 years , agreed that israel was provoked into attacking hamas targets , but that the offensive has now gone on too long . " it is hamas who is to blame for the recent hostilities , " she said .
" but the israeli offensive has gone too far now , " she said . most of those interviewed said that war was not the answer to the region 's complex problems . " hamas and the israelis must sit with international representatives and come to peace .
it does n't matter who fired first , " said burak tatlioglu , 53 , a muslim who immigrated to germany from turkey in 1993 and now lives in bonn . jewish groups : hamas to blame for deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe-wide protests have been held to support israel 's right to strike hamas the central council of jews in germany has placed the blame for the recent conflict squarely on hamas and asserted the right of the jewish state to go on the offensive . " the defense of -lrb- israeli -rrb- citizens is not aggression and also not a violation of human rights .
israel has to protect the rights of and its obligation to its citizens , " said president charlotte knobloch on the council 's web site . " hamas carries the exclusive responsibility of civilian casualties on both sides , " she said . the european jewish congress also supported israel 's right to launch an assault in the gaza strip and organized pro-israel demonstrations in berlin , frankfurt and munich over the weekend , which attracted around 2,000 protestors . plea for civilians some muslim organizations in germany , such as the turkish islamic union of the institute of religion -lrb- ditib -rrb- , have avoided playing the blame game and have called simply for an end to hostilities for the sake of civilians in gaza . " we are convinced of the fact that wars , hate and conflict do not bear a solution , but only human misery and pain .
we appeal here to reason and the sense of responsibility of those involved , " said sadi arslan , chairman of the ditib . arslan said both israel and hamas had to return to the negotiating table to find a solution . " a reciprocal renouncement of acts of violence , provocations and law breaking , as well as dialogue between both parties mediated by the world community , is the best way out of this intolerable situation in gaza , " he said . muslim group : hamas , israel both aggressors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-gaza demonstrations have been held all over the world the central council of muslims in germany said israel 's actions violated the principles of international law .
but , he said , hamas too had to end its rocket fire on israeli settlements if a lasting peace was to be found . " the bombardment of mosques , parliament buildings , schools and university mechanisms and many public places -lrb- by israel -rrb- are a condition which can not be accepted and which must be stopped immediately , " said the council 's spokesman erol puerlue . but puerlue also called for an end to hamas rocket attacks on parts of southern israel .

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately .

eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , home to europe 's second-largest muslim community , calls are growing to end the bloodshed and spare civilian lives . pro-israeli and pro-palestinian groups have long feuded over who holds the moral high-ground in this ongoing conflict , but consensus is widespread that non-combatants in gaza are paying the price for the inability of hamas and israel to negotiate a peace to this most recent outbreak of violence . in germany , which has western europe 's second-largest muslim population after france , many in the muslim community see hamas as the instigator in this recent episode but are calling for an end to the israeli offensive for the sake of palestinian civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many civilians have been caught up in the gaza war willy ibrahimbegov , 24 , a german muslim whose family emigrated from bosnia in 1989 , said the israeli offensive has been disproportionate when compared with hamas rocket attacks . " i 'm angry because it 's not fair what 's going on , " he said .
" it 's clear that hamas started the war again , but you can not compare ten rockets to what israel is doing .
and you can not compare two israeli lives with a thousand lives in palestine .
these are lives of innocent people , " he said . ibrahimbegov warned that a rising death toll would further stoke palestinian anger , pushing the people in the gaza strip into the arms of hamas . " more and more people will support hamas in palestine because most people there want revenge , " he said . violence not the solution irawati sulamet , 59 , who was born and raised in the world 's most populous muslim nation , indonesia , but has resided in germany for the last 30 years , agreed that israel was provoked into attacking hamas targets , but that the offensive has now gone on too long . " it is hamas who is to blame for the recent hostilities , " she said .
" but the israeli offensive has gone too far now , " she said . most of those interviewed said that war was not the answer to the region 's complex problems . " hamas and the israelis must sit with international representatives and come to peace .
it does n't matter who fired first , " said burak tatlioglu , 53 , a muslim who immigrated to germany from turkey in 1993 and now lives in bonn . jewish groups : hamas to blame for deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe-wide protests have been held to support israel 's right to strike hamas the central council of jews in germany has placed the blame for the recent conflict squarely on hamas and asserted the right of the jewish state to go on the offensive . " the defense of -lrb- israeli -rrb- citizens is not aggression and also not a violation of human rights .
israel has to protect the rights of and its obligation to its citizens , " said president charlotte knobloch on the council 's web site . " hamas carries the exclusive responsibility of civilian casualties on both sides , " she said . the european jewish congress also supported israel 's right to launch an assault in the gaza strip and organized pro-israel demonstrations in berlin , frankfurt and munich over the weekend , which attracted around 2,000 protestors . plea for civilians some muslim organizations in germany , such as the turkish islamic union of the institute of religion -lrb- ditib -rrb- , have avoided playing the blame game and have called simply for an end to hostilities for the sake of civilians in gaza . " we are convinced of the fact that wars , hate and conflict do not bear a solution , but only human misery and pain .
we appeal here to reason and the sense of responsibility of those involved , " said sadi arslan , chairman of the ditib . arslan said both israel and hamas had to return to the negotiating table to find a solution . " a reciprocal renouncement of acts of violence , provocations and law breaking , as well as dialogue between both parties mediated by the world community , is the best way out of this intolerable situation in gaza , " he said . muslim group : hamas , israel both aggressors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-gaza demonstrations have been held all over the world the central council of muslims in germany said israel 's actions violated the principles of international law .
but , he said , hamas too had to end its rocket fire on israeli settlements if a lasting peace was to be found . " the bombardment of mosques , parliament buildings , schools and university mechanisms and many public places -lrb- by israel -rrb- are a condition which can not be accepted and which must be stopped immediately , " said the council 's spokesman erol puerlue . but puerlue also called for an end to hamas rocket attacks on parts of southern israel .

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .

thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately . "
a deteriorating energy situation caused by gas shortages was particularly grim in moldova .
there was no hot water throughout the former soviet republic , and major industrial plants remained idle .
residential heating was minimal with fuel-short central heating plants struggling to bring sufficient warmth to radiators .
" all of this has gone for too long , " laitenberger of the eu commission said .

" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .

those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .

only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .
negotiations underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni has been holding talks with western leaders at the same as livni met with rice in washington , israeli negotiator , amos gilad , was returning to egypt friday with instructions from caretaker prime minister ehud olmert , defence minister ehud barak and livni .
only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 16.01.2009 european union split over divorce law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu states say the new divorce law would weaken their own laws european union justice ministers were split friday over eu rules governing divorce between mixed-nationality couples , with 10 states seeking to adopt new divorce laws despite opposition from the european commission . the debate revolves around the question of which law should be applied when citizens of two different eu member states who are married want a divorce - a question to which there is no standardized eu answer .
" at this moment , we do have enough countries " to launch a system of enhanced cooperation on divorce issues , czech justice minister jiri pospisil , who headed the informal meeting of eu counterparts in prague , told journalists . the concept of " enhanced cooperation " was created by the eu 's 1997 treaty of amsterdam .
it allows groups of at least eight member states to ask the commission to apply eu-level laws to them if the bloc as a whole has failed to approve the legislation . but eu justice commissioner jacques barrot countered that claim , saying the current group of countries " is not enough " to launch such cooperation , " because at that moment we would have a very fragmented family law . " in 2006 , the commission - the eu ’ s executive arm - proposed a bloc-wide rule setting out which national divorce law should apply when mixed-nationality couples split , but sweden vetoed it , arguing that it could bind swedes to less liberal divorce laws . " it would mean that the right to get a divorce would be not as good in sweden , and i ca n't accept that because you can make agreements on many things , but not to lower your fundamental rights , " swedish justice minister beatrice ask said in prague . some eu states still seek law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european states have higher than average divorce rates following the veto , nine eu states - austria , bulgaria , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg , romania , slovenia and spain - wrote to the commission for permission to apply the eu-level law anyway .
france was reportedly preparing to join the group in january . " the fact that one country has big problems with moving forwards in this domain should encourage the others to go on .

to many , he is still a hero . it was the most drastic protest against the soviet-led invasion which crushed the communist reform movement - the so-called prague spring in 1968 . at 2:30 in the afternoon on jan .
16 , 1969 , 20-year-old university student jan palach poured gasoline over himself in wenceslas square and set himself on fire .
his self-immolation is viewed as a symbol of the despair felt by the people in czechoslovakia under moscow 's oppressive hand . a streetcar worker was the first to react to the flames and used his coat to cover palach and extinguish the flames .
the philosophy student was taken to hospital , where his first words were reportedly : " i 'm not committing suicide ! " covered in burns , he was interviewed by a psychiatrist who worked for the czechoslovakian secret police .
the doctor asked palach if he was in pain .
" enough , " he said .
" people have to fight against evil when they can , " he continued in a choked-up voice .
palach died three days later , refusing pain medication until the end . suffering for a cause in his farewell letter , palach mentioned a group of people who had all decided to burn themselves as a political protest .
he was the first and there were more burnings in the weeks and months following . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague has seen many protests come and go , but palach wo n't be forgotten his act even spurred copycats as recently as in 2003 when a series of self-burnings as a form of protest broke out in the nation . palach 's burial was attended by artists , politicians and friends .
some 200,000 people took part in a funeral march for him through prague . " palach 's death was immediately understood by society , " vaclav havel , playwright and later president of czechoslovakia , said in an interview at the time .
" everyone wants to do something extreme when everything else is so helpless . " havel himself was arrested in 1989 for laying flowers by a statue in honor of the 20th anniversary of palach 's death . a hero for some " in his state of helplessness , he offered the only thing he had - his life , " said jakub trojan , the evangelical pastor at palach 's burial . the 40th anniversary of the young student 's act in downtown prague and his death are marked by numerous memorial events . as one czech university student recently told deutschlandfunk broadcaster , palch is viewed " as a hero , because he was prepared to sacrifice his life due to the political situation .
i can say that i 'm proud to be a student in the same faculty that he studied in . " palach 's life and death are also the subject of a 600-page book that has just been published . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 . lower saxony environment minister hans-heinrich sander said he was only informed of the damage to the storage site thursday , but the radiation office said the ministry had been informed all along . the bfs said it could not rule out damage to the waste containers should the asse site ceiling collapse , but gave its reassurances that it would reinforce the seals of the chamber with concrete to stop any radioactive dust or air escaping . precautionary step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the office says it will reinforce the chamber containing radioactive waste drums the office said the measures were only a precaution and that there was no immediate danger posed by the site .
it said the waste inside the chamber contained only " weak " levels of radioactivity . the site has not been used for fresh radioactive storage since 1978 , with environmental groups regularly calling for waste there to be removed and stored in a safer location . nuclear energy has been a contentious issue in germany for several decades .
a majority of germans oppose the construction of new nuclear plants because of what they believe to be the high risk of a terrorist attack . but with most industrialized nations seeking to lower their carbon footprint , nuclear power has received a fresh breath of life .
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative cdu party says turning back to nuclear could reduce germany 's dependence on russian gas and middle eastern oil . merkel 's party want to examine possible life extensions to some of germany 's 17 nuclear power stations .
not doing so , the party says , would undermine the country 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the united states carries the responsibility for the people who have been in guantanamo for years now , " schaeuble said on thursday , jan .
15 , at a meeting of eu interior ministers meeting in prague . according to reports , president-elect barack obama , who takes office on jan .
20 , has vowed to immediately shut down the controversial prison built to hold suspects in the us war on terror , many of whom were never tried . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants to close guantanamo , but what to do about its inmates ?
closing the facility in guantanamo bay , cuba means that a portion of the remaining 248 prisoners will have to be transferred to other countries . schaeuble also pointed out that , as far as he is aware , none of the remaining guantanamo inmates are germans nor are any of them citizens who grew up in germany . the number of inmates left " is not a number that is unbelievably high , and the us is not a small country , " he added . the question of what to do with the guantanamo bay prisoners has caused controversy outside of germany as well , as several eu countries are at odds over the matter . guantanamo source of eu conflict austria and france voiced their stance against receiving inmates at the eu interior ministers meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many inmates have never been tried , a fact that has sparked human rights debates " america created guantanamo .

according to a spokesperson for the ministry , french foreign minister bernard kouchner wants to " review the matter favorably . " kouchner 's stance clearly illustrates the widespread conflict between eu interior ministers and their foreign ministry counterparts . the netherlands has ruled out accepting any newly freed inmates , while portugal has said it might do so .
sweden has said guantanamo bay is washington 's responsibility and , according to media reports , denmark will refuse any us request to take in prisoners .
poland has expressed doubts whether it can deal with the type of prisoners being held . eu foreign ministers will discuss the problem at talks in brussels on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.01.2009 germany blasts geo-engineering scheme in atlantic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polarstern is germany 's most famous research vessel after international outcry from governments and envrionmental groups , germany has postponed an experiment in the south atlantic which could potentially pull massive amounts of carbon out of the air . a german research vessel charged with carrying out an experiment involving the dumping of six tons of iron sulfate into the ocean off the coast of antarctica has been ordered to halt the test until further assessments can be conducted .
the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 16.01.2009 european leaders seek more help for car industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is vital to both germany and the european union european union governments agreed on friday to step up aid for their struggling carmakers but called for a coordinated response to avoid a race for subsidies among the bloc 's 27 nations . european union industry ministers met in brussels on friday to find ways of supporting their troubled car industries amid calls for up to 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.2 billion -rrb- in credit from the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- .
eib officials attending the talks said they planned to approve in march 3.2 billion euros in soft loans to help carmakers develop greener and more fuel-efficient cars .
but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they also said they 'd be ready to increase aid .
" naturally there is always the question of whether we could do more .
but first we have to implement what we have , " said eib vice-president matthias kollatz-ahnen .
" it is clear that ... there will be additional projects , but they are not now mature , " he said .
europe 's most important industry eu leaders agreed in december to provide 4 billion euros in eib loans in december .
but sources close to friday 's talks in brussels said some ministers had called for this amount to be raised to 10 billion euros .
carmakers , which represent europe 's most important industry , have been hard hit by the economic crisis , with sales falling by eight percent in 2008 over the previous year .
experts predict a further fall in sales of between 10 and 20 percent in 2009 , with sales of heavy-duty vehicles likely to fall by 30 percent .
adding to the difficulties , access to private credit has also been stifled by the credit crunch , meaning the eib is often the only lender available .
help from outside the industry needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lot of the pressure is coming from new eu laws regarding car emission standards european industry commissioner guenther verheugen noted that while the " primary responsibility to respond to these challenges rests with industry itself , " public support for the sector was also necessary .
this was particularly needed in view of the eu 's strict targets on car emissions , which are set to come into force over the next decade .
so far , germany , spain , sweden and portugal have already finalized national rescue plans , with france and italy set to follow suit .
but verheugen warned governments against engaging in a " subsidies race " and to avoid distorting the internal market by supporting only national champions .
coordinated policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this car is clearly old enough to qualify for the german program the commissioner said industry ministers had agreed to coordinate their policies , which range from financial incentives to scrap old cars to the purchasing of vehicles by the public sector .
france , for example , has pledged 400 million euros for research and development over four years and 300 million for restructuring the automotive sector , while germany has promised an exemption from annual tax for new cars purchased before june 30 and an incentive to scrap cars nine years or older worth 2,500 euros per vehicle .
" there is agreement that such support needs to be effective and coordinated .
it should respect key principles such as open global markets , fair competition , better regulation as well as cooperation and transparency , " verheugen said .
the commissioner also highlighted the need to engage in " early dialogue " with the new us administration of barack obama as it puts in place its own plans to support us carmakers . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i believe we can reach an agreement that will resolve the situation and lead to the transit of russian gas , " he said through an interpreter . merkel told reporters there might be a test phase where gas pumping was resumed under monitoring by european union inspectors . she said the inspectors would check the pipeline transit system to ensure that gas destined for western europe " does not disappear in ukraine . " " time is of the essence " despite a series of agreements , russian gas exports via ukraine remained cut off for the 10th day friday , leaving some european countries without sufficient fuel to heat homes and factories . " technical " gas is at the focus of the ongoing dispute because ukraine insists it has a right to remove 21 million cubic meters of gas daily to power the pumps whereas russia accuses the ukrainians of " stealing " the gas .
ukraine denies the accusation . " i think we will eventually find a solution , " said merkel , who appealed to both russia and the ukraine to return to the negotiating to end what was essentially a commercial dispute . " time is of the essence , " she said , adding that a settlement was also in the interests of russia and gazprom .
otherwise there would be a loss of confidence in them , she said . " last chance " to resolve the dispute putin earlier met executives of e.on ruhrgas of germany , eni of italy and gaz de france in a berlin hotel . the russian premier proposed that a western consortium pay for technical gas , which is removed from the pipeline to run the equipment that keep the remainder of the gas moving westwards . putin said the cost of the gas to power the pumps would be $ 730 million in the first quarter of this year alone .
he said that strictly speaking , it should be ukraine that paid to power the pumps . although germany is still receiving russian gas via belarus and has high stocks - 59 per cent of maximum storage capacity as of monday this week - it is pressing for a quick end to the kiev-moscow dispute . merkel phoned ukraine 's leaders on thursday , before her meeting with putin , who was paying his first visit to germany since leaving the russian presidency and becoming prime minister in may 2008 . the european union relies on russia for about 20 per cent of its natural gas .
germany , europe 's biggest economy , gets 37 per cent of its gas supplies from russia . putin is due to meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko for talks on energy in moscow on saturday .
on friday , senior officials from eastern europe gathered in kiev for a blitz energy summit . " the european commission believes that the meetings in the coming days offer the last and best chance for russia and ukraine to demonstrate they are serious about resolving this dispute , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said .
" the gas must flow .
we will regard this period as a test case for judging whether or not they are credible partners . " controversy in dresden following his talks with merkel , putin travelled to the eastern city of dresden to pick up an award for promoting russo-german cultural relations . a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , said putin did not deserve the honor because of atrocities committed by russian troops in chechnya during his time as president . putin served as a soviet kgb officer in dresden until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.01.2009 germany blasts geo-engineering scheme in atlantic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polarstern is germany 's most famous research vessel after international outcry from governments and envrionmental groups , germany has postponed an experiment in the south atlantic which could potentially pull massive amounts of carbon out of the air . a german research vessel charged with carrying out an experiment involving the dumping of six tons of iron sulfate into the ocean off the coast of antarctica has been ordered to halt the test until further assessments can be conducted .
the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i believe we can reach an agreement that will resolve the situation and lead to the transit of russian gas , " he said through an interpreter . merkel told reporters there might be a test phase where gas pumping was resumed under monitoring by european union inspectors . she said the inspectors would check the pipeline transit system to ensure that gas destined for western europe " does not disappear in ukraine . " " time is of the essence " despite a series of agreements , russian gas exports via ukraine remained cut off for the 10th day friday , leaving some european countries without sufficient fuel to heat homes and factories . " technical " gas is at the focus of the ongoing dispute because ukraine insists it has a right to remove 21 million cubic meters of gas daily to power the pumps whereas russia accuses the ukrainians of " stealing " the gas .
ukraine denies the accusation . " i think we will eventually find a solution , " said merkel , who appealed to both russia and the ukraine to return to the negotiating to end what was essentially a commercial dispute . " time is of the essence , " she said , adding that a settlement was also in the interests of russia and gazprom .
otherwise there would be a loss of confidence in them , she said . " last chance " to resolve the dispute putin earlier met executives of e.on ruhrgas of germany , eni of italy and gaz de france in a berlin hotel . the russian premier proposed that a western consortium pay for technical gas , which is removed from the pipeline to run the equipment that keep the remainder of the gas moving westwards . putin said the cost of the gas to power the pumps would be $ 730 million in the first quarter of this year alone .
he said that strictly speaking , it should be ukraine that paid to power the pumps . although germany is still receiving russian gas via belarus and has high stocks - 59 per cent of maximum storage capacity as of monday this week - it is pressing for a quick end to the kiev-moscow dispute . merkel phoned ukraine 's leaders on thursday , before her meeting with putin , who was paying his first visit to germany since leaving the russian presidency and becoming prime minister in may 2008 . the european union relies on russia for about 20 per cent of its natural gas .
germany , europe 's biggest economy , gets 37 per cent of its gas supplies from russia . putin is due to meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko for talks on energy in moscow on saturday .
on friday , senior officials from eastern europe gathered in kiev for a blitz energy summit . " the european commission believes that the meetings in the coming days offer the last and best chance for russia and ukraine to demonstrate they are serious about resolving this dispute , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said .
" the gas must flow .
we will regard this period as a test case for judging whether or not they are credible partners . " controversy in dresden following his talks with merkel , putin travelled to the eastern city of dresden to pick up an award for promoting russo-german cultural relations . a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , said putin did not deserve the honor because of atrocities committed by russian troops in chechnya during his time as president . putin served as a soviet kgb officer in dresden until the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.01.2009 germany blasts geo-engineering scheme in atlantic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polarstern is germany 's most famous research vessel after international outcry from governments and envrionmental groups , germany has postponed an experiment in the south atlantic which could potentially pull massive amounts of carbon out of the air . a german research vessel charged with carrying out an experiment involving the dumping of six tons of iron sulfate into the ocean off the coast of antarctica has been ordered to halt the test until further assessments can be conducted .
the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .
while the ship is being provided by the germans , much of the financing was contributed by new delhi . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to many , he is still a hero . it was the most drastic protest against the soviet-led invasion which crushed the communist reform movement - the so-called prague spring in 1968 . at 2:30 in the afternoon on jan .
16 , 1969 , 20-year-old university student jan palach poured gasoline over himself in wenceslas square and set himself on fire .
his self-immolation is viewed as a symbol of the despair felt by the people in czechoslovakia under moscow 's oppressive hand . a streetcar worker was the first to react to the flames and used his coat to cover palach and extinguish the flames .
the philosophy student was taken to hospital , where his first words were reportedly : " i 'm not committing suicide ! " covered in burns , he was interviewed by a psychiatrist who worked for the czechoslovakian secret police .
the doctor asked palach if he was in pain .
" enough , " he said .
" people have to fight against evil when they can , " he continued in a choked-up voice .
palach died three days later , refusing pain medication until the end . suffering for a cause in his farewell letter , palach mentioned a group of people who had all decided to burn themselves as a political protest .
he was the first and there were more burnings in the weeks and months following . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague has seen many protests come and go , but palach wo n't be forgotten his act even spurred copycats as recently as in 2003 when a series of self-burnings as a form of protest broke out in the nation . palach 's burial was attended by artists , politicians and friends .
some 200,000 people took part in a funeral march for him through prague . " palach 's death was immediately understood by society , " vaclav havel , playwright and later president of czechoslovakia , said in an interview at the time .
" everyone wants to do something extreme when everything else is so helpless . " havel himself was arrested in 1989 for laying flowers by a statue in honor of the 20th anniversary of palach 's death . a hero for some " in his state of helplessness , he offered the only thing he had - his life , " said jakub trojan , the evangelical pastor at palach 's burial . the 40th anniversary of the young student 's act in downtown prague and his death are marked by numerous memorial events . as one czech university student recently told deutschlandfunk broadcaster , palch is viewed " as a hero , because he was prepared to sacrifice his life due to the political situation .
i can say that i 'm proud to be a student in the same faculty that he studied in . " palach 's life and death are also the subject of a 600-page book that has just been published . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .

14 . lower saxony environment minister hans-heinrich sander said he was only informed of the damage to the storage site thursday , but the radiation office said the ministry had been informed all along . the bfs said it could not rule out damage to the waste containers should the asse site ceiling collapse , but gave its reassurances that it would reinforce the seals of the chamber with concrete to stop any radioactive dust or air escaping . precautionary step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the office says it will reinforce the chamber containing radioactive waste drums the office said the measures were only a precaution and that there was no immediate danger posed by the site .
it said the waste inside the chamber contained only " weak " levels of radioactivity . the site has not been used for fresh radioactive storage since 1978 , with environmental groups regularly calling for waste there to be removed and stored in a safer location . nuclear energy has been a contentious issue in germany for several decades .
a majority of germans oppose the construction of new nuclear plants because of what they believe to be the high risk of a terrorist attack . but with most industrialized nations seeking to lower their carbon footprint , nuclear power has received a fresh breath of life .
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative cdu party says turning back to nuclear could reduce germany 's dependence on russian gas and middle eastern oil . merkel 's party want to examine possible life extensions to some of germany 's 17 nuclear power stations .
not doing so , the party says , would undermine the country 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .
negotiations underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni has been holding talks with western leaders at the same as livni met with rice in washington , israeli negotiator , amos gilad , was returning to egypt friday with instructions from caretaker prime minister ehud olmert , defence minister ehud barak and livni .
only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal " should be thought of as one of the elements of trying to help bring into being a durable ceasefire ... that can actually hold , " rice said in washington , adding she hoped a truce would be reached " very , very soon . "
israeli foreign minister tzipi livni , who was in washington to sign the agreement , called it a " historic " deal that was a " vital component for the cessation of hostilities . "
only through a " united effort " to combat terrorism could a ceasefire between the two sides be achieved , livni said .
israel launched its gaza offensive on december 27 in a bid to curb near-daily rocket and mortar attacks from the strip at its south .
more than 1,100 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
thirteen israelis have also been killed , including three civilians .
un chief calls for unilateral truce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon is asking for israel to declare a humanitarian truce meanwhile , united nations secretary general ban ki-moon , in the west bank city of ramallah friday for talks with palestinian officials , reiterated that the situation in gaza had become " unbearable " and urged israel to declare an urgent unilateral humanitarian truce , before finalizing a long-term ceasefire in talks with egypt and washington .
those talks , he nevertheless said , were " close " to reaching a truce and could come to fruition in " a couple of days . "
" there is no time to lose .
if we wait one more day , there will be more killings and destruction , ” he told a news conference with palestinian caretaker prime minister salam fayyad .
negotiations underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister tzipi livni has been holding talks with western leaders at the same as livni met with rice in washington , israeli negotiator , amos gilad , was returning to egypt friday with instructions from caretaker prime minister ehud olmert , defence minister ehud barak and livni .
only after his return from cairo was israel 's final response on the egyptian initiative expected .
a defence ministry spokeswoman said she did not know when he would return and when the cabinet was likely to hold the vote .
egyptian initiative the egyptian initiative calls for an immediate short-term " humanitarian " truce during which egypt will lead indirect negotiations on a longer-term ceasefire , that should include guarantees against border security - an israeli demand - nd an end to the economic blockade of gaza - a hamas demand .
that short-term truce could last anything between five days to two weeks - during which the israeli military would gradually withdraw from gaza - while the long-term truce could last one year .
the initiative also calls on hamas and its bitter rival , the fatah party of palestinian president mahmoud abbas , to resume reconciliation talks that would eventually end the split between gaza and the abbas-run west bank .
fighting continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fighting continues in gaza , despite the negotiations the latest round of diplomacy came amid the worst day of fighting in gaza thursday in israel 's now 21-day offensive , in which israel shelled a un compound , killed one of hamas ' top three leaders in gaza , and made the deepest advance into gaza city yet , sparking intense battles with local militants little more than a kilometer from the heart of the city .
hamas vowed to avenge the death of its de-facto interior minister said siam , who also headed its security forces , and declared friday another " day of rage " calling for protests in the west bank .
as ground troops withdrew from gaza city , the israel air force kept up its attacks , striking another 40 targets , including a mosque in northern gaza allegedly storing rockets , several more rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels under the border with egypt . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately . "
a deteriorating energy situation caused by gas shortages was particularly grim in moldova .
there was no hot water throughout the former soviet republic , and major industrial plants remained idle .
residential heating was minimal with fuel-short central heating plants struggling to bring sufficient warmth to radiators .
" all of this has gone for too long , " laitenberger of the eu commission said .
the eu relies on russian gas via ukraine for around a fifth of its supplies , mostly via ukraine .
germany , europe 's largest economy , is even more dependent , with moscow supplying 37 percent of its needs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 . lower saxony environment minister hans-heinrich sander said he was only informed of the damage to the storage site thursday , but the radiation office said the ministry had been informed all along . the bfs said it could not rule out damage to the waste containers should the asse site ceiling collapse , but gave its reassurances that it would reinforce the seals of the chamber with concrete to stop any radioactive dust or air escaping . precautionary step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the office says it will reinforce the chamber containing radioactive waste drums the office said the measures were only a precaution and that there was no immediate danger posed by the site .
it said the waste inside the chamber contained only " weak " levels of radioactivity . the site has not been used for fresh radioactive storage since 1978 , with environmental groups regularly calling for waste there to be removed and stored in a safer location . nuclear energy has been a contentious issue in germany for several decades .
a majority of germans oppose the construction of new nuclear plants because of what they believe to be the high risk of a terrorist attack . but with most industrialized nations seeking to lower their carbon footprint , nuclear power has received a fresh breath of life .
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative cdu party says turning back to nuclear could reduce germany 's dependence on russian gas and middle eastern oil . merkel 's party want to examine possible life extensions to some of germany 's 17 nuclear power stations .
not doing so , the party says , would undermine the country 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .

the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately .

merkel said moscow is losing credibility as a result of the gas row . speaking in berlin after talks with british prime minister gordon brown on thursday , jan .
15 , angela merkel said the gas dispute , which has left large parts of europe without heating in freezing temperatures , could end up hurting moscow 's image .
" the danger that russia will also lose part of its credibility because of these interruptions of -lrb- gas -rrb- supplies is certainly one that exists , " merkel told reporters .
" tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- in my talks with prime minister putin , i will have to address this issue , " she said , adding that the problems are " an expression of still unsolved political problems " between russia and ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and brown stressed the need to end the damaging gas dispute " we have to restore trust and responsibility , " she said .
brown said the gas feud underlined the necessity for europe to diversify its energy sources .
" if we can not rely on supplies from particular areas of the world , then it is all the more important , " he said .
brown was to hold talks in london later thursday with ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko , his office said .
talks " long overdue " the comments came as russian and ukrainian leaders agreed thursday to hold new talks , with putin 's spokesman saying he would meet ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko in moscow on saturday .
the european union welcomed the move , saying it was long overdue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's planned talks with tymoshenko have been welcomed by the eu " the eu presidency and the european commission consider that high-level discussions between russia and ukraine on this issue are long overdue , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger said in brussels .
the european union said it was prepared to send the czech energy minister , representing the czech eu presidency , and the eu energy commissioner to take part in the russia-ukraine meeting in moscow on saturday .
but the eu has so far held off on responding to kremlin leader dmitry medvedev 's proposal to hold a broader summit of all the countries affected by the gas crisis including consumers and transit nations in moscow the same day .
accusations and counter-accusations the latest gas dispute erupted after russia cut off supplies to ukraine 's domestic market on new year 's day in a payments row .
it then halted deliveries to europe through ukraine on january 7 , saying it was forced to do so because ukraine was siphoning the gas .
ukraine has denied the charge and accuses russia of provoking a crisis .
the eu over the weekend attempted to break the deadlock by sending observers to both ukraine and russia , with no results so far .
russia attempted to open taps partially on tuesday but ukraine said transport of gas to europe was impossible due to low pressure in ukraine 's gas pipeline system .
it demanded russia restart shipments at full pre-crisis volumes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man cuts firewood in sarajevo as the gas cuts left large parts of europe without heating in the thick of winter officials in brussels confirmed thursday that no russian gas was yet flowing through ukrainian pipelines and renewed their appeal for supplies to resume " immediately . "
a deteriorating energy situation caused by gas shortages was particularly grim in moldova .
there was no hot water throughout the former soviet republic , and major industrial plants remained idle .
residential heating was minimal with fuel-short central heating plants struggling to bring sufficient warmth to radiators .
" all of this has gone for too long , " laitenberger of the eu commission said .
the eu relies on russian gas via ukraine for around a fifth of its supplies , mostly via ukraine .
germany , europe 's largest economy , is even more dependent , with moscow supplying 37 percent of its needs . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at this moment , we do have enough countries " to launch a system of enhanced cooperation on divorce issues , czech justice minister jiri pospisil , who headed the informal meeting of eu counterparts in prague , told journalists . the concept of " enhanced cooperation " was created by the eu 's 1997 treaty of amsterdam .
it allows groups of at least eight member states to ask the commission to apply eu-level laws to them if the bloc as a whole has failed to approve the legislation . but eu justice commissioner jacques barrot countered that claim , saying the current group of countries " is not enough " to launch such cooperation , " because at that moment we would have a very fragmented family law . " in 2006 , the commission - the eu ’ s executive arm - proposed a bloc-wide rule setting out which national divorce law should apply when mixed-nationality couples split , but sweden vetoed it , arguing that it could bind swedes to less liberal divorce laws . " it would mean that the right to get a divorce would be not as good in sweden , and i ca n't accept that because you can make agreements on many things , but not to lower your fundamental rights , " swedish justice minister beatrice ask said in prague . some eu states still seek law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european states have higher than average divorce rates following the veto , nine eu states - austria , bulgaria , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg , romania , slovenia and spain - wrote to the commission for permission to apply the eu-level law anyway .
france was reportedly preparing to join the group in january . " the fact that one country has big problems with moving forwards in this domain should encourage the others to go on .
it 's not the ideal solution , but i think that sometimes you have to use the possibilities offered by the treaty , " luxembourg justice minister luc frieden said . the enhanced-cooperation system has not yet been used .
barrot , the eu commissioner , said friday that he did not see the need to start now . he said that at least half the eu 's 27 member states would have to ask for enhanced cooperation for it to become realistic . but the czech minister , pospisil , said that support for the idea of enhanced cooperation " is actually rising " among eu states , and that the czech eu presidency was ready to open a debate on the subject . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 . lower saxony environment minister hans-heinrich sander said he was only informed of the damage to the storage site thursday , but the radiation office said the ministry had been informed all along . the bfs said it could not rule out damage to the waste containers should the asse site ceiling collapse , but gave its reassurances that it would reinforce the seals of the chamber with concrete to stop any radioactive dust or air escaping . precautionary step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the office says it will reinforce the chamber containing radioactive waste drums the office said the measures were only a precaution and that there was no immediate danger posed by the site .
it said the waste inside the chamber contained only " weak " levels of radioactivity . the site has not been used for fresh radioactive storage since 1978 , with environmental groups regularly calling for waste there to be removed and stored in a safer location . nuclear energy has been a contentious issue in germany for several decades .
a majority of germans oppose the construction of new nuclear plants because of what they believe to be the high risk of a terrorist attack . but with most industrialized nations seeking to lower their carbon footprint , nuclear power has received a fresh breath of life .
german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative cdu party says turning back to nuclear could reduce germany 's dependence on russian gas and middle eastern oil . merkel 's party want to examine possible life extensions to some of germany 's 17 nuclear power stations .
not doing so , the party says , would undermine the country 's goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the geo-engineering scheme is being conducted by a joint german-indian research team on board the polarstern , a ship owned by the alfred-wegener-institute for oceanic research -lrb- awi -rrb- in the north-western german city of bremerhaven .
environmental groups around the globe have severely criticized the project , which was meant to cause an algae bloom designed to soak up harmful carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
putting on the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alfred-wegener-institute owns the ship and is germany 's leading oceanic research body ulrich bathmann , a researcher at awi and the person responsible for running the experiment from land , confirmed that the ship will no longer be dumping its cargo into the sea after german environment minister sigmar gabriel called for more tests to determine the safety of the project .
“ the ministry of education and research has asked us to continue with the preparation of the experiment , but to not actually start doing the fertilization before we have the positive reviews on the table , ” he added .
bathmann says the ship will still need another three to four days to reach the location and that an additional six days will be spent “ investigating the vicinity ” to determine the perfect place to conduct the experiment .
environmental groups unconvinced according to bathmann , awi agrees that “ a proper environmental assessment needs to be conducted prior to the experiment . ”
environmental groups , however , are n't as convinced .
jim thomas with the international civil society organization etc group , based in ottawa , canada , says conducting an assessment under such time pressure is not an effective measure of whether or not the experiment can be carried out safely .
“ i ca n't see how the experimenters on board a ship steaming towards the scotia sea can do a rational , reasoned , careful analysis , ” thomas added .
ocean fertilization suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel oversaw the implementation of the moratorium last may the etc group and other environmental organizations cite the united nations convention on biodiversity , which met in bonn last may and instated a moratorium on ocean fertilization until further research had been done .
thomas points out that not only are both germany and india signatories to the convention , but that sigmar gabriel personally brokered the moratorium agreement .
“ this has been rushed too quickly , it 's not being done in the proper order and at the moment it 's undermining germany 's image in the world in terms of its leadership on environmental issues , ” said thomas planning for the experiment began in 2005 , well before the moratorium was put into place , and was officially signed into agreement by german chancellor angela merkel and indian prime minister manmohan singh in october 2007 .
the iron-sowing expedition , named lohafex , comprises 48 scientists , 30 of them from india 's national institute of oceanography -lrb- nio -rrb- .

two young students - amanda knox and raffaele sollecito - kiss and embrace outside an italian police station , seemingly oblivious to the investigation about to engulf them .
now , 14 months later , both are standing trial for the killing of british woman meredith kercher .
the body of meredith , an exchange student at the university of perugia , was discovered half-naked in the bedroom of her shared house .
her throat had been cut .
an acquaintance - rudy hermann guede , originally from the ivory coast - has already been convicted of murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison .
seattle-born amanda , 21 , and raffaele , 24 , from the southern italian city of giovinazzo , have both denied involvement in meredith 's death .
middle-class but how did these bright , middle-class young people with their lives ahead of them end up being charged with such a grim murder and , after more than a year in custody , what is likely to be their defence ?
according to raffaele 's letter to an italian magazine , the pair met at a concert just two weeks before the murder .
they became an item .
both have admitted a fondness for marijuana - a drug they blamed for their inability to recall their movements on the night meredith died .
although from different countries , amanda and raffaele appear to come from similar comfortable , middle-class backgrounds .
amanda 's family - who term themselves " typically american " - helped fund their daughter 's year in italy in order to further her italian , german and creative writing studies . "
even the thought that she -lrb- amanda -rrb- could be a killer is impossible for me " raffaele sollecito their savings have now largely gone , according to amanda 's father curt knox .
he has said the family will have " literally nothing " after paying for a team of lawyers , forensic experts , investigators and a media advisor in a bid to prove their daughter 's innocence .
raffaele 's family - his father is a urologist - was wealthy enough to buy their student son a flat in perugia .
it is the same flat that amanda now claims she spent the night in when meredith was murdered - reports of her initial statement to police originally placed her at the scene of the crime .
details began emerging of amanda 's private life - her " foxy knoxy " nickname , the drug taking and claims she slept with several men after she arrived in italy .
in letters from his jail cell , her boyfriend wrote : " the amanda i know ... lives a carefree life . "
" her only thought is the pursuit of pleasure , " wrote raffaele to his father .
" but , " he adds , " even the thought that she could be a killer is impossible for me . "
reporters descended on amanda 's home city of seattle in search of more details of her private life .
they discovered that the university of washington student had been arrested and fined in 2007 for her role in a drunken party that police were called to .
a picture began to be painted of a " party girl " who abused drink and drugs and had an active sex life .
tabloid interest intensified after it emerged that amanda had written a short story on a social networking site about a young man who drugs and rapes a young girl .
in it , one character remarks : " a thing you have to know about chicks is that they do n't know what they want . "
" what also makes it interesting is there is a genuine mystery about what happened , and the sex " frank sfarzo , italian journalist apart from that story , her page on the networking site portrays a very different amanda .
on it , she describes herself as a non-drinker and non-smoker .
her favourite pursuits include yoga and " backpacking long distances with people i know " .
among her favourite films are shrek and the full monty and she likes listening to the beatles and reading harry potter books .
it was partly a desire to emphasise this aspect of their daughter 's character , and counter what they term her " misrepresentation " , that led amanda 's supporters in seattle to set up a tribute website .
on it , family and friends write about the " joiner " who excelled at sports and school plays ; a " smart , fun , affectionate and loyal " girl who bought sandwiches for homeless people and nursed sick friends .
they are optimistic that she will be freed by the italian courts .
her father told the seattle times : " we will take this as far as we have to take this , because she 's walking out of there totally free of anything related to this . "
according to alleged leaks of her prison diary , amanda is similarly determined to maintain her innocence - and may be preparing to blame her ex-boyfriend .
she is reported to have written : " i think it is possible raffaele went to meredith 's house , raped her , then killed her and then when when he got home , while i was sleeping , he pressed my fingerprints on the knife . "
neither of their cases were helped by cctv evidence that found its way into the italian press , reportedly showing the pair buying sexy underwear together two days after meredith 's death .
raffaele has blamed himself for making a " trap " with his own hands .
so far , his defence has been that he was at home surfing the internet on the night of the murder - although police say his computer records do not support this .
he has also admitted smoking marijuana at the time .
in a letter to an italian magazine he wrote : " one morning you return to her house and find a big mess .
" the problems begin : the police arrive , break down the locked door to a bedroom and discover the lifeless body of one of her -lrb- amanda 's -rrb- friends .
" from then on they suspect everyone and everything . "
to his father he promises : " dad , i will never smoke another joint in my life . "
for perugia journalist frank sfarzo , who is writing a detailed blog on the trial , the involvement of drugs is just one factor in what he describes as a fascinating case .
" what also makes it interesting is there is a genuine mystery about what happened , and , of course , the sex .
" it 's also because these are two young people with supporters and enemies all over the world , and the fact that it all happened in this beautiful town .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- italy focuses on ' foxy knoxy ' as trial opens bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 05:08 gmt , friday , 16 january 2009 italy focuses on ' foxy knoxy ' as trial opens by duncan kennedy bbc news in perugia as the meredith kercher murder trial starts , much of the attention will be on just one of those accused of her death - her friend amanda knox .
perugia is set to become gridlocked with television satellite trucks .
around 150 journalists are expected to descend on the central italian town to cover the murder trial of 21-year-old british student meredith kercher .
and they are prepared for the long haul .
the trial could last until july .
the prosecution alone has filed a list of 90 witnesses and the court will sit only two or three times a week .
the raw facts surrounding the death of meredith kercher - she died on 1 november 2007 between 2030 and 2300 in perugia - are not in dispute .
pretty much everything else is .
which is how we 've arrived at this point of two people on trial for killing her .
throat cut meredith susanna cara kercher was from coulsdon , south london , and was a student at leeds university .
she was part of the erasmus student exchange programme and it took her to perugia .
she became a friend of , and shared a house with , amanda knox , an american student from seattle in washington state .
amanda knox had a boyfriend called raffaele sollecito , another student at the university of perugia .
police say meredith 's body was found under a blood-soaked duvet in an upstairs bedroom of the house she lived in with amanda knox .
her throat had been cut .
initially , detectives believed she may have been attacked by a burglar , as the door to her room was locked and one of her windows broken .
but they now suspect the break-in was staged .
they believe that miss knox stabbed miss kercher while mr sollecito held her down and a third man tried to rape her during a sex game that went badly wrong .
that third man is rudy guede , who has already been convicted of killing meredith after a separate trial last year .
he was given a 30-year life sentence .
miss knox and mr sollecito claim to have been together at mr sollecito 's apartment at the time of the murder and therefore could not have done it .
that apparently contradicts earlier statements to the police in which miss knox stated she had heard meredith 's screams and that she had put her fingers in her ears as she was so frightened .
her defence team say that her memory was clouded because she had been smoking hashish that evening .
but police say they have more evidence .
they say they found miss knox 's dna and meredith 's dna on a knife in mr sollecito 's kitchen which investigators believe is the murder weapon .
they also claim there were traces of miss knox 's blood mixed with meredith kercher 's in their bathroom .
and they say there were traces of mr sollecito 's dna on a clasp from miss kercher 's bra .
lady macbeth figure as they have done at previous hearings , defence lawyers are likely to argue that the dna evidence was contaminated and is therefore unreliable .
however , while there are two people on trial , amanda knox has in many ways become the public face of this case .
it 's perhaps not surprising .
just look at the alleged ingredients of the case : sex , murder and outsiders in a foreign land .
amanda knox was portrayed as a lady macbeth figure before she was even put on trial .
raffaele sollecito gets no such coverage .
you can see the difference in italian and other newspapers .
hardly any report is complete without reference to what they say are amanda knox 's " angel-faced " good looks .
some have found it hard to resist using the rhythmic concoction of " foxy knoxy " .
they relish any news that comes out of the jail she is being held in .
take , for instance , the role she had in a movie filmed inside the prison .
called the last city , miss knox plays an inmate dreaming of escape .
not only did news of her participation fill pages of newspapers and online sites , but the outraged reaction to it generated yet more coverage .
and all this despite it being an approved prison project partly-funded by a local authority .
italian celebrity then there was the pre-christmas " personality of the year " poll that put her in fourth position , ahead of other candidates like france 's first lady carla bruni and former french-colombian hostage ingrid betancourt .
the poll , for an italian tv news channel , gave her 8 % of the vote , the highest-ranked woman in the survey .
more headlines followed .
amanda knox 's quasi-celebrity status has also been fuelled by a website in her name established by her family .
primarily a platform for generating money to fund her legal case , it also provides a catalogue of photographs from her childhood to the present day thereby partially fuelling , still further , curiosity in her .
family members and friends are quoted on the site saying amanda knox is " misunderstood " and speak of the " ugly lies " about her .
her parents , curt and edda , say the site is a way of redressing the imbalance they see in the reporting .
they seem genuinely astounded at the level of interest in amanda and deeply disillusioned by what they see as the distorted coverage of the case .
there is much at stake .
their daughter 's liberty for one thing .
the trial opening in perugia is about amanda knox , but it is also about raffaele sollecito .
and it is about meredith kercher and her family .
they are civil plaintiffs in the case and could be called as witnesses .
it can sometimes be easy to lose track of that .

although from different countries , amanda and raffaele appear to come from similar comfortable , middle-class backgrounds .
amanda 's family - who term themselves " typically american " - helped fund their daughter 's year in italy in order to further her italian , german and creative writing studies .
even the thought that she -lrb- amanda -rrb- could be a killer is impossible for me raffaele sollecito their savings have now largely gone , according to amanda 's father curt knox .
he has said the family will have " literally nothing " after paying for a team of lawyers , forensic experts , investigators and a media advisor in a bid to prove their daughter 's innocence .
raffaele 's family - his father is a urologist - was wealthy enough to buy their student son a flat in perugia .
it is the same flat that amanda now claims she spent the night in when meredith was murdered - reports of her initial statement to police originally placed her at the scene of the crime .
details began emerging of amanda 's private life - her " foxy knoxy " nickname , the drug taking and claims she slept with several men after she arrived in italy .
in letters from his jail cell , her boyfriend wrote : " the amanda i know ... lives a carefree life . "
" her only thought is the pursuit of pleasure , " wrote raffaele to his father .
" but , " he adds , " even the thought that she could be a killer is impossible for me . "
amanda excelled at school studies and sports , according to friends reporters descended on amanda 's home city of seattle in search of more details of her private life .
they discovered that the university of washington student had been arrested and fined in 2007 for her role in a drunken party that police were called to .
a picture began to be painted of a " party girl " who abused drink and drugs and had an active sex life .
tabloid interest intensified after it emerged that amanda had written a short story on a social networking site about a young man who drugs and rapes a young girl .
in it , one character remarks : " a thing you have to know about chicks is that they do n't know what they want . "
what also makes it interesting is there is a genuine mystery about what happened , and the sex frank sfarzo , italian journalist apart from that story , her page on the networking site portrays a very different amanda .
on it , she describes herself as a non-drinker and non-smoker .
her favourite pursuits include yoga and " backpacking long distances with people i know " .
among her favourite films are shrek and the full monty and she likes listening to the beatles and reading harry potter books .
it was partly a desire to emphasise this aspect of their daughter 's character , and counter what they term her " misrepresentation " , that led amanda 's supporters in seattle to set up a tribute website .
on it , family and friends write about the " joiner " who excelled at sports and school plays ; a " smart , fun , affectionate and loyal " girl who bought sandwiches for homeless people and nursed sick friends .
they are optimistic that she will be freed by the italian courts .
her father told the seattle times : " we will take this as far as we have to take this , because she 's walking out of there totally free of anything related to this . "
according to alleged leaks of her prison diary , amanda is similarly determined to maintain her innocence - and may be preparing to blame her ex-boyfriend .
she is reported to have written : " i think it is possible raffaele went to meredith 's house , raped her , then killed her and then when when he got home , while i was sleeping , he pressed my fingerprints on the knife . "
raffaele said the thought of amanda as a killer was " impossible " neither of their cases were helped by cctv evidence that found its way into the italian press , reportedly showing the pair buying sexy underwear together two days after meredith 's death .
raffaele has blamed himself for making a " trap " with his own hands .
so far , his defence has been that he was at home surfing the internet on the night of the murder - although police say his computer records do not support this .
he has also admitted smoking marijuana at the time .
in a letter to an italian magazine he wrote : " one morning you return to her house and find a big mess .
" the problems begin : the police arrive , break down the locked door to a bedroom and discover the lifeless body of one of her -lrb- amanda 's -rrb- friends .
" from then on they suspect everyone and everything . "
to his father he promises : " dad , i will never smoke another joint in my life . "
for perugia journalist frank sfarzo , who is writing a detailed blog on the trial , the involvement of drugs is just one factor in what he describes as a fascinating case .
" what also makes it interesting is there is a genuine mystery about what happened , and , of course , the sex .

two young students - amanda knox and raffaele sollecito - kiss and embrace outside an italian police station , seemingly oblivious to the investigation about to engulf them .
now , 14 months later , both are standing trial for the killing of british woman meredith kercher .
the body of meredith , an exchange student at the university of perugia , was discovered half-naked in the bedroom of her shared house .
her throat had been cut .
an acquaintance - rudy hermann guede , originally from the ivory coast - has already been convicted of murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison .
seattle-born amanda , 21 , and raffaele , 24 , from the southern italian city of giovinazzo , have both denied involvement in meredith 's death .
middle-class but how did these bright , middle-class young people with their lives ahead of them end up being charged with such a grim murder and , after more than a year in custody , what is likely to be their defence ?
according to raffaele 's letter to an italian magazine , the pair met at a concert just two weeks before the murder .
they became an item .
both have admitted a fondness for marijuana - a drug they blamed for their inability to recall their movements on the night meredith died .
although from different countries , amanda and raffaele appear to come from similar comfortable , middle-class backgrounds .
amanda 's family - who term themselves " typically american " - helped fund their daughter 's year in italy in order to further her italian , german and creative writing studies .
even the thought that she -lrb- amanda -rrb- could be a killer is impossible for me raffaele sollecito their savings have now largely gone , according to amanda 's father curt knox .
he has said the family will have " literally nothing " after paying for a team of lawyers , forensic experts , investigators and a media advisor in a bid to prove their daughter 's innocence .
raffaele 's family - his father is a urologist - was wealthy enough to buy their student son a flat in perugia .
it is the same flat that amanda now claims she spent the night in when meredith was murdered - reports of her initial statement to police originally placed her at the scene of the crime .
details began emerging of amanda 's private life - her " foxy knoxy " nickname , the drug taking and claims she slept with several men after she arrived in italy .
in letters from his jail cell , her boyfriend wrote : " the amanda i know ... lives a carefree life . "
" her only thought is the pursuit of pleasure , " wrote raffaele to his father .
" but , " he adds , " even the thought that she could be a killer is impossible for me . "
amanda excelled at school studies and sports , according to friends reporters descended on amanda 's home city of seattle in search of more details of her private life .
they discovered that the university of washington student had been arrested and fined in 2007 for her role in a drunken party that police were called to .
a picture began to be painted of a " party girl " who abused drink and drugs and had an active sex life .
tabloid interest intensified after it emerged that amanda had written a short story on a social networking site about a young man who drugs and rapes a young girl .
in it , one character remarks : " a thing you have to know about chicks is that they do n't know what they want . "
what also makes it interesting is there is a genuine mystery about what happened , and the sex frank sfarzo , italian journalist apart from that story , her page on the networking site portrays a very different amanda .
on it , she describes herself as a non-drinker and non-smoker .
her favourite pursuits include yoga and " backpacking long distances with people i know " .
among her favourite films are shrek and the full monty and she likes listening to the beatles and reading harry potter books .
it was partly a desire to emphasise this aspect of their daughter 's character , and counter what they term her " misrepresentation " , that led amanda 's supporters in seattle to set up a tribute website .
on it , family and friends write about the " joiner " who excelled at sports and school plays ; a " smart , fun , affectionate and loyal " girl who bought sandwiches for homeless people and nursed sick friends .
they are optimistic that she will be freed by the italian courts .
her father told the seattle times : " we will take this as far as we have to take this , because she 's walking out of there totally free of anything related to this . "
according to alleged leaks of her prison diary , amanda is similarly determined to maintain her innocence - and may be preparing to blame her ex-boyfriend .
she is reported to have written : " i think it is possible raffaele went to meredith 's house , raped her , then killed her and then when when he got home , while i was sleeping , he pressed my fingerprints on the knife . "
raffaele said the thought of amanda as a killer was " impossible " neither of their cases were helped by cctv evidence that found its way into the italian press , reportedly showing the pair buying sexy underwear together two days after meredith 's death .
raffaele has blamed himself for making a " trap " with his own hands .
so far , his defence has been that he was at home surfing the internet on the night of the murder - although police say his computer records do not support this .
he has also admitted smoking marijuana at the time .
in a letter to an italian magazine he wrote : " one morning you return to her house and find a big mess .
" the problems begin : the police arrive , break down the locked door to a bedroom and discover the lifeless body of one of her -lrb- amanda 's -rrb- friends .
" from then on they suspect everyone and everything . "
to his father he promises : " dad , i will never smoke another joint in my life . "

two young students - amanda knox and raffaele sollecito - kiss and embrace outside an italian police station , seemingly oblivious to the investigation about to engulf them .
now , 14 months later , both are standing trial for the killing of british woman meredith kercher .
the body of meredith , an exchange student at the university of perugia , was discovered half-naked in the bedroom of her shared house .
her throat had been cut .
an acquaintance - rudy hermann guede , originally from the ivory coast - has already been convicted of murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison .
seattle-born amanda , 21 , and raffaele , 24 , from the southern italian city of giovinazzo , have both denied involvement in meredith 's death .
middle-class but how did these bright , middle-class young people with their lives ahead of them end up being charged with such a grim murder and , after more than a year in custody , what is likely to be their defence ?
according to raffaele 's letter to an italian magazine , the pair met at a concert just two weeks before the murder .
they became an item .
both have admitted a fondness for marijuana - a drug they blamed for their inability to recall their movements on the night meredith died .
although from different countries , amanda and raffaele appear to come from similar comfortable , middle-class backgrounds .
amanda 's family - who term themselves " typically american " - helped fund their daughter 's year in italy in order to further her italian , german and creative writing studies .
even the thought that she -lrb- amanda -rrb- could be a killer is impossible for me raffaele sollecito their savings have now largely gone , according to amanda 's father curt knox .
he has said the family will have " literally nothing " after paying for a team of lawyers , forensic experts , investigators and a media advisor in a bid to prove their daughter 's innocence .
raffaele 's family - his father is a urologist - was wealthy enough to buy their student son a flat in perugia .
it is the same flat that amanda now claims she spent the night in when meredith was murdered - reports of her initial statement to police originally placed her at the scene of the crime .
details began emerging of amanda 's private life - her " foxy knoxy " nickname , the drug taking and claims she slept with several men after she arrived in italy .
in letters from his jail cell , her boyfriend wrote : " the amanda i know ... lives a carefree life . "
" her only thought is the pursuit of pleasure , " wrote raffaele to his father .
" but , " he adds , " even the thought that she could be a killer is impossible for me . "
amanda excelled at school studies and sports , according to friends reporters descended on amanda 's home city of seattle in search of more details of her private life .
they discovered that the university of washington student had been arrested and fined in 2007 for her role in a drunken party that police were called to .
a picture began to be painted of a " party girl " who abused drink and drugs and had an active sex life .
tabloid interest intensified after it emerged that amanda had written a short story on a social networking site about a young man who drugs and rapes a young girl .
in it , one character remarks : " a thing you have to know about chicks is that they do n't know what they want . "
what also makes it interesting is there is a genuine mystery about what happened , and the sex frank sfarzo , italian journalist apart from that story , her page on the networking site portrays a very different amanda .
on it , she describes herself as a non-drinker and non-smoker .
her favourite pursuits include yoga and " backpacking long distances with people i know " .
among her favourite films are shrek and the full monty and she likes listening to the beatles and reading harry potter books .
it was partly a desire to emphasise this aspect of their daughter 's character , and counter what they term her " misrepresentation " , that led amanda 's supporters in seattle to set up a tribute website .
on it , family and friends write about the " joiner " who excelled at sports and school plays ; a " smart , fun , affectionate and loyal " girl who bought sandwiches for homeless people and nursed sick friends .
they are optimistic that she will be freed by the italian courts .
her father told the seattle times : " we will take this as far as we have to take this , because she 's walking out of there totally free of anything related to this . "
according to alleged leaks of her prison diary , amanda is similarly determined to maintain her innocence - and may be preparing to blame her ex-boyfriend .
she is reported to have written : " i think it is possible raffaele went to meredith 's house , raped her , then killed her and then when when he got home , while i was sleeping , he pressed my fingerprints on the knife . "
raffaele said the thought of amanda as a killer was " impossible " neither of their cases were helped by cctv evidence that found its way into the italian press , reportedly showing the pair buying sexy underwear together two days after meredith 's death .
raffaele has blamed himself for making a " trap " with his own hands .
so far , his defence has been that he was at home surfing the internet on the night of the murder - although police say his computer records do not support this .
he has also admitted smoking marijuana at the time .
in a letter to an italian magazine he wrote : " one morning you return to her house and find a big mess .
" the problems begin : the police arrive , break down the locked door to a bedroom and discover the lifeless body of one of her -lrb- amanda 's -rrb- friends .
" from then on they suspect everyone and everything . "
to his father he promises : " dad , i will never smoke another joint in my life . "
for perugia journalist frank sfarzo , who is writing a detailed blog on the trial , the involvement of drugs is just one factor in what he describes as a fascinating case .
" what also makes it interesting is there is a genuine mystery about what happened , and , of course , the sex .
" it 's also because these are two young people with supporters and enemies all over the world , and the fact that it all happened in this beautiful town . " julian.joyce @ bbc.co.uk bookmark with : delicious digg reddit facebook stumbleupon what are these ?

perugia is set to become gridlocked with television satellite trucks .
around 150 journalists are expected to descend on the central italian town to cover the murder trial of 21-year-old british student meredith kercher .
and they are prepared for the long haul .
the trial could last until july .
the prosecution alone has filed a list of 90 witnesses and the court will sit only two or three times a week .
the raw facts surrounding the death of meredith kercher - she died on 1 november 2007 between 2030 and 2300 in perugia - are not in dispute .
pretty much everything else is .
which is how we 've arrived at this point of two people on trial for killing her .
throat cut meredith susanna cara kercher was from coulsdon , south london , and was a student at leeds university .
she was part of the erasmus student exchange programme and it took her to perugia .
she became a friend of , and shared a house with , amanda knox , an american student from seattle in washington state .
amanda knox had a boyfriend called raffaele sollecito , another student at the university of perugia .
police say meredith 's body was found under a blood-soaked duvet in an upstairs bedroom of the house she lived in with amanda knox .
her throat had been cut .
initially , detectives believed she may have been attacked by a burglar , as the door to her room was locked and one of her windows broken .
meredith kercher was a british student in italy but they now suspect the break-in was staged .
they believe that miss knox stabbed miss kercher while mr sollecito held her down and a third man tried to rape her during a sex game that went badly wrong .
that third man is rudy guede , who has already been convicted of killing meredith after a separate trial last year .
he was given a 30-year life sentence .
miss knox and mr sollecito claim to have been together at mr sollecito 's apartment at the time of the murder and therefore could not have done it .
that apparently contradicts earlier statements to the police in which miss knox stated she had heard meredith 's screams and that she had put her fingers in her ears as she was so frightened .
her defence team say that her memory was clouded because she had been smoking hashish that evening .
but police say they have more evidence .
they say they found miss knox 's dna and meredith 's dna on a knife in mr sollecito 's kitchen which investigators believe is the murder weapon .
they also claim there were traces of miss knox 's blood mixed with meredith kercher 's in their bathroom .
and they say there were traces of mr sollecito 's dna on a clasp from miss kercher 's bra .
lady macbeth figure as they have done at previous hearings , defence lawyers are likely to argue that the dna evidence was contaminated and is therefore unreliable .
however , while there are two people on trial , amanda knox has in many ways become the public face of this case .
it 's perhaps not surprising .
just look at the alleged ingredients of the case : sex , murder and outsiders in a foreign land .
amanda knox was portrayed as a lady macbeth figure before she was even put on trial .
raffaele sollecito gets no such coverage .
you can see the difference in italian and other newspapers .
hardly any report is complete without reference to what they say are amanda knox 's " angel-faced " good looks .
some have found it hard to resist using the rhythmic concoction of " foxy knoxy " .

perugia is set to become gridlocked with television satellite trucks .
around 150 journalists are expected to descend on the central italian town to cover the murder trial of 21-year-old british student meredith kercher .
and they are prepared for the long haul .
the trial could last until july .
the prosecution alone has filed a list of 90 witnesses and the court will sit only two or three times a week .
the raw facts surrounding the death of meredith kercher - she died on 1 november 2007 between 2030 and 2300 in perugia - are not in dispute .
pretty much everything else is .
which is how we 've arrived at this point of two people on trial for killing her .
throat cut meredith susanna cara kercher was from coulsdon , south london , and was a student at leeds university .
she was part of the erasmus student exchange programme and it took her to perugia .
she became a friend of , and shared a house with , amanda knox , an american student from seattle in washington state .
amanda knox had a boyfriend called raffaele sollecito , another student at the university of perugia .
police say meredith 's body was found under a blood-soaked duvet in an upstairs bedroom of the house she lived in with amanda knox .
her throat had been cut .
initially , detectives believed she may have been attacked by a burglar , as the door to her room was locked and one of her windows broken .
meredith kercher was a british student in italy but they now suspect the break-in was staged .
they believe that miss knox stabbed miss kercher while mr sollecito held her down and a third man tried to rape her during a sex game that went badly wrong .
that third man is rudy guede , who has already been convicted of killing meredith after a separate trial last year .
he was given a 30-year life sentence .
miss knox and mr sollecito claim to have been together at mr sollecito 's apartment at the time of the murder and therefore could not have done it .
that apparently contradicts earlier statements to the police in which miss knox stated she had heard meredith 's screams and that she had put her fingers in her ears as she was so frightened .
her defence team say that her memory was clouded because she had been smoking hashish that evening .
but police say they have more evidence .
they say they found miss knox 's dna and meredith 's dna on a knife in mr sollecito 's kitchen which investigators believe is the murder weapon .
they also claim there were traces of miss knox 's blood mixed with meredith kercher 's in their bathroom .
and they say there were traces of mr sollecito 's dna on a clasp from miss kercher 's bra .
lady macbeth figure as they have done at previous hearings , defence lawyers are likely to argue that the dna evidence was contaminated and is therefore unreliable .
however , while there are two people on trial , amanda knox has in many ways become the public face of this case .
it 's perhaps not surprising .
just look at the alleged ingredients of the case : sex , murder and outsiders in a foreign land .
amanda knox was portrayed as a lady macbeth figure before she was even put on trial .
raffaele sollecito gets no such coverage .
you can see the difference in italian and other newspapers .
hardly any report is complete without reference to what they say are amanda knox 's " angel-faced " good looks .
some have found it hard to resist using the rhythmic concoction of " foxy knoxy " .
they relish any news that comes out of the jail she is being held in .
take , for instance , the role she had in a movie filmed inside the prison .
called the last city , miss knox plays an inmate dreaming of escape .
not only did news of her participation fill pages of newspapers and online sites , but the outraged reaction to it generated yet more coverage .
and all this despite it being an approved prison project partly-funded by a local authority .

the poll , for an italian tv news channel , gave her 8 % of the vote , the highest-ranked woman in the survey .

amanda knox 's quasi-celebrity status has also been fuelled by a website in her name established by her family .

initially , detectives believed she may have been attacked by a burglar , as the door to her room was locked and one of her windows broken .
meredith kercher was a british student in italy but they now suspect the break-in was staged .
they believe that miss knox stabbed miss kercher while mr sollecito held her down and a third man tried to rape her during a sex game that went badly wrong .
that third man is rudy guede , who has already been convicted of killing meredith after a separate trial last year .
he was given a 30-year life sentence .
miss knox and mr sollecito claim to have been together at mr sollecito 's apartment at the time of the murder and therefore could not have done it .
that apparently contradicts earlier statements to the police in which miss knox stated she had heard meredith 's screams and that she had put her fingers in her ears as she was so frightened .
her defence team say that her memory was clouded because she had been smoking hashish that evening .
but police say they have more evidence .
they say they found miss knox 's dna and meredith 's dna on a knife in mr sollecito 's kitchen which investigators believe is the murder weapon .
they also claim there were traces of miss knox 's blood mixed with meredith kercher 's in their bathroom .
and they say there were traces of mr sollecito 's dna on a clasp from miss kercher 's bra .
lady macbeth figure as they have done at previous hearings , defence lawyers are likely to argue that the dna evidence was contaminated and is therefore unreliable .
however , while there are two people on trial , amanda knox has in many ways become the public face of this case .
it 's perhaps not surprising .
just look at the alleged ingredients of the case : sex , murder and outsiders in a foreign land .
amanda knox was portrayed as a lady macbeth figure before she was even put on trial .
raffaele sollecito gets no such coverage .
you can see the difference in italian and other newspapers .
hardly any report is complete without reference to what they say are amanda knox 's " angel-faced " good looks .
some have found it hard to resist using the rhythmic concoction of " foxy knoxy " .
they relish any news that comes out of the jail she is being held in .
take , for instance , the role she had in a movie filmed inside the prison .
called the last city , miss knox plays an inmate dreaming of escape .
not only did news of her participation fill pages of newspapers and online sites , but the outraged reaction to it generated yet more coverage .
and all this despite it being an approved prison project partly-funded by a local authority .
italian celebrity then there was the pre-christmas " personality of the year " poll that put her in fourth position , ahead of other candidates like france 's first lady carla bruni and former french-colombian hostage ingrid betancourt .
the poll , for an italian tv news channel , gave her 8 % of the vote , the highest-ranked woman in the survey .
more headlines followed .
amanda knox 's quasi-celebrity status has also been fuelled by a website in her name established by her family .
primarily a platform for generating money to fund her legal case , it also provides a catalogue of photographs from her childhood to the present day thereby partially fuelling , still further , curiosity in her .
family members and friends are quoted on the site saying amanda knox is " misunderstood " and speak of the " ugly lies " about her .

the trial opening in perugia is about amanda knox , but it is also about raffaele sollecito .

perugia is set to become gridlocked with television satellite trucks .
around 150 journalists are expected to descend on the central italian town to cover the murder trial of 21-year-old british student meredith kercher .
and they are prepared for the long haul .
the trial could last until july .
the prosecution alone has filed a list of 90 witnesses and the court will sit only two or three times a week .
the raw facts surrounding the death of meredith kercher - she died on 1 november 2007 between 2030 and 2300 in perugia - are not in dispute .
pretty much everything else is .
which is how we 've arrived at this point of two people on trial for killing her .
throat cut meredith susanna cara kercher was from coulsdon , south london , and was a student at leeds university .
she was part of the erasmus student exchange programme and it took her to perugia .
she became a friend of , and shared a house with , amanda knox , an american student from seattle in washington state .
amanda knox had a boyfriend called raffaele sollecito , another student at the university of perugia .
police say meredith 's body was found under a blood-soaked duvet in an upstairs bedroom of the house she lived in with amanda knox .
her throat had been cut .
initially , detectives believed she may have been attacked by a burglar , as the door to her room was locked and one of her windows broken .

he has found the same tone in his transition meetings with barack obama , his final round of interviews and his closing news conference - almost as though he wants america to admire him for the grace with which he is handing on power , even if it did not often admire him for the way in which he exercised it .
the speech will not be remembered for its eloquence , although it did contain the odd shaft of poetry with talk of a country that even in tough times " lifts its eyes to the broad horizons ahead " .
and it will not resonate down the hallways of history either , as other presidential farewells have done in the past .
this was the moment when george washington chose to warn his fellow countrymen of the perils of foreign entanglements , the moment when dwight eisenhower alerted his nation to the power of the military-industrial complex .
but it was a speech which succeeded in its own terms - mr bush set out to portray himself as an essentially decent man who had followed his conscience in making difficult choices , asking only that his fellow countrymen respect the sincerity with which he approached his task .
and that is precisely what he did .
eye on posterity his presidency will be forever defined by the attacks on new york and washington on 9/11 and by the events which flowed from them - including the still unresolved military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan .
as mr bush put it : " as the years passed , most americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
but i never did .
every morning , i received a briefing on the threats to our nation .
and i vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe . "
the president was , in effect , inviting his most passionate critics to set what they most dislike about him in this context : to see the expansion of wire-tapping , extraordinary rendition , water-boarding and the opening of the detention camp at guantanamo bay as the actions of an administration seeking to contain an active and continuing threat from a dangerous enemy .
for a man with a generally mild public demeanour , mr bush has a truly startling ability to conjure demons of rage in his critics and opponents .
one conservative columnist here even coined the phrase " bush derangement syndrome " to describe the the strength of emotion he provokes in those who disagree with him .
with those critics , his words will cut no ice - they will continue to believe that he has compromised american freedoms in defence of american freedom .
but you sensed that mr bush already has his eyes on history 's verdict - knowing from his abysmally low opinion poll ratings that the judgement of his own day has already gone against him .
who knows - perhaps historians will judge him kindly as a man who remained eternally vigilant to the threat of renewed attack , reorganised its security services to deal with the threat , and kept his people safe .
for the moment though , he looks more like a man who has seen the country 's budget deficit double on his watch and who is leaving power with the us mired in two foreign conflicts and deep in recession .
unshaken it was never going to be the place for any sort of honest reckoning of mistakes - although mr bush has owned up to a few in recent weeks - but there was a degree of humility in the admission that there were things he would do differently if given the chance .
but there was something much more revealing about a line which followed shortly afterwards , in which mr bush said : " you may not agree with the tough decisions i 've made , but i hope you 'll agree i was ready to make the tough decisions . "
in that single sentence , mr bush is acknowledging the unpopularity of much of what he has done , while also signalling the depth of his continuing conviction that he got those big decisions right .
the overall tone of the speech had a melancholic feel to it .
mr bush , a successful businessman , a two-term president and two-term governor of texas , has been a winner nearly all his life .
this can not be how he imagined his time in office ending , with the low ratings , the sense of fatigue and the unmistakable appetite in america for the era of barack obama to begin .
as far as history 's verdict goes , mr bush must now hope that the truman factor will come into play .
harry truman was highly unpopular when he left office in the early 1950s , but most historians now recognise that he was a great president who was dealt a losing hand by history and who played it with skill and style .
when i asked one eminent american historian if he thought there would be a truman effect for mr bush in the future he paused for a moment , then burst out laughing .
even mr bush seems to catch a sense of the impatience for a change of administration that is in the air , praising his successor -lrb- who is an ideological opponent , do not forget -rrb- as a man " whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land " .
so what was mr obama 's verdict on his predecessor 's final performance on network television ?
well it was eloquent , but unspoken .
at the moment mr bush began to speak , we received a few lines of copy from the white house announcing that the president-elect had left his temporary home in washington and headed out to dinner .

with those critics , his words will cut no ice - they will continue to believe that he has compromised american freedoms in defence of american freedom .
but you sensed that mr bush already has his eyes on history 's verdict - knowing from his abysmally low opinion poll ratings that the judgement of his own day has already gone against him .
who knows - perhaps historians will judge him kindly as a man who remained eternally vigilant to the threat of renewed attack , reorganised its security services to deal with the threat , and kept his people safe .
for the moment though , he looks more like a man who has seen the country 's budget deficit double on his watch and who is leaving power with the us mired in two foreign conflicts and deep in recession .
unshaken it was never going to be the place for any sort of honest reckoning of mistakes - although mr bush has owned up to a few in recent weeks - but there was a degree of humility in the admission that there were things he would do differently if given the chance .
but there was something much more revealing about a line which followed shortly afterwards , in which mr bush said : " you may not agree with the tough decisions i 've made , but i hope you 'll agree i was ready to make the tough decisions . "
in that single sentence , mr bush is acknowledging the unpopularity of much of what he has done , while also signalling the depth of his continuing conviction that he got those big decisions right .
the president leaves the country deep in recession the overall tone of the speech had a melancholic feel to it .
mr bush , a successful businessman , a two-term president and two-term governor of texas , has been a winner nearly all his life .
this can not be how he imagined his time in office ending , with the low ratings , the sense of fatigue and the unmistakable appetite in america for the era of barack obama to begin .
as far as history 's verdict goes , mr bush must now hope that the truman factor will come into play .
harry truman was highly unpopular when he left office in the early 1950s , but most historians now recognise that he was a great president who was dealt a losing hand by history and who played it with skill and style .
when i asked one eminent american historian if he thought there would be a truman effect for mr bush in the future he paused for a moment , then burst out laughing .
even mr bush seems to catch a sense of the impatience for a change of administration that is in the air , praising his successor -lrb- who is an ideological opponent , do not forget -rrb- as a man " whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land " .
so what was mr obama 's verdict on his predecessor 's final performance on network television ?
well it was eloquent , but unspoken .
at the moment mr bush began to speak , we received a few lines of copy from the white house announcing that the president-elect had left his temporary home in washington and headed out to dinner .

bush backs record in final speech he has found the same tone in his transition meetings with barack obama , his final round of interviews and his closing news conference - almost as though he wants america to admire him for the grace with which he is handing on power , even if it did not often admire him for the way in which he exercised it .
the speech will not be remembered for its eloquence , although it did contain the odd shaft of poetry with talk of a country that even in tough times " lifts its eyes to the broad horizons ahead " .

this was the moment when george washington chose to warn his fellow countrymen of the perils of foreign entanglements , the moment when dwight eisenhower alerted his nation to the power of the military-industrial complex .

but i never did .
every morning , i received a briefing on the threats to our nation .

the president was , in effect , inviting his most passionate critics to set what they most dislike about him in this context : to see the expansion of wire-tapping , extraordinary rendition , water-boarding and the opening of the detention camp at guantanamo bay as the actions of an administration seeking to contain an active and continuing threat from a dangerous enemy .

the global music trade body said this is its biggest challenge as artists and record companies miss out on payments .
there has , however , been a 25 % rise since last year with downloads now accounting for a fifth of all recorded music sales .
the ifpi said worldwide music market revenues shrank by 7 % last year .
steady growth this was blamed on falling cd sales , while the increase in digital sales failed to make up for this .
the ifpi , which represents 1,400 companies in 72 countries , estimated more than 40 billion music files were illegally shared in 2008 .
there were 1.4 billion single tracks legally downloaded in 2008 , with the top-selling digital single , lil wayne 's lollipop , selling 9.1 million copies .

they have sewn the turkish national flag to the top - a mark of solidarity for those suffering in gaza .
" we are all palestinian now , " mustafa says .
" why is no-one stopping israel ? "
graffiti daubed in red paint on a nearby fence reads : " child killer israel . "
it 's just a fraction of the fury here at israel 's bombardment of gaza .
across the country , there have been regular demonstrations - some tens of thousands strong .
outside the israeli consulate , there is a noisy round-the-clock protest where demonstrators burn israeli flags and throw eggs .
there was a small explosion on monday at a nearby bank that 's part-owned by israel .
this week a teachers ' organisation from antalya sent a shoe to the consulate , as an insult .
most outspoken though has been prime minister recep tayyip erdogan himself .
they ask us why we do n't cut ties with israel ...
we are running the turkish republic , not a grocery store recep tayyip erdogan , turkish prime minister he has referred to israeli action in gaza as " savagery " , " a crime-against humanity " and " state terror , " and warned israel that it will " reap what it sows " .
" people say my statements are too harsh , " mr erdogan said on tuesday .
" they are no harsher than the phosphorus bombs used by israel .
" civilians and children are dying in gaza , " he added .
" those who keep their silence over these attacks out of whatever concern or for whatever diplomatic reason , will pay the price before history . "
support at risk with local elections due in march , a weak stance on the gaza offensive could lose mr erdogan 's ak party crucial support from more religious voters .
but the prime minister 's condemnation of israel strikes a chord with most turks , devout or otherwise .
it is difficult rhetoric for israel to swallow from an ally .
turkey was the first mainly muslim country to recognise israel .
in 1996 , the two countries signed an agreement forging strong defence and intelligence ties .
but israel 's offensive in gaza has caused outrage .
" there is a great deal of disappointment that there has not been one word of sympathy from turkey about the israelis , " a senior israeli diplomat told the bbc .
" its rhetoric has entirely sided with hamas .
even the arab countries talk about the need for both sides to stop the violence . "
in power since 2002 , mr erdogan 's party has worked to boost turkey 's role in the middle east .
it is in the interest of us both to maintain good relations .
but politically it will take a long time for things to return to normal israeli diplomat it has cultivated closer ties with iran and syria as well as israel .
immediately after the hamas election victory of 2006 , turkey invited its leader , khaled meshaal , to ankara - arguing the importance of engagement over isolation .
" i am sure the akp 's own religious background plays a role here , but its policy is that you have to reach out to everyone , " says soli ozel , international relations specialist at bilgi university .
that approach helped turkey mediate pre-talks about peace between syria and israel last year , now abandoned .
but some argue that turkey has now compromised its " honest-broker " credentials .
" the prime minister 's language has damaged turkey 's policy of equal distance from all partners , " mr ozel says .
" -lsb- that -rsb- can soothe burning hearts in turkey .
but it limits any steps ankara can take , or its influence in the future . "
central role turkey 's position has won it a crucial role in the gaza ceasefire talks , though .
the prime minister 's chief adviser has acted as the central conduit to hamas , shuttling between damascus and cairo as egypt tries to negotiate with israel .
un secretary general ban ki-moon is expected to discuss that process during his visit here on friday , including details of a mooted international monitoring presence on gaza 's border .
turkey has already volunteered troops .
" we will contribute to a monitoring force , " foreign ministry spokesman burak ozugergin confirms .
" but we did not offer any contribution to a peacekeeping force .
that is a whole new ball game .
we can discuss it if we arrive at that point . "
" child killer israel " is the graffiti daubed on this wall in istanbul every day , the turkish press carries graphic reports of the suffering in gaza .
local aid agencies have sent truckloads of aid in response .
the education ministry called an unprecedented minute 's silence in all schools this week for children dying in gaza .
anger at israel has at times spilled over into anti-semitism .
israeli diplomats say protesters delivered a petition on tuesday calling for the expulsion of all israelis from turkey and warning that they have a list of jewish business people to circulate .
graffiti on one city wall reads : " we do n't want you in turkey .
whore .
zionists .
scum . "
angry themselves at turkey 's attitude , israelis have reportedly cancelled business and tourist trips here .
but both sides agree their relationship will survive in the long run , when turkey has ambitions of helping to reconcile the competing palestinian factions hamas and fatah .
" it is in the interest of us both to maintain good relations , " an israeli diplomat explained .
" but politically it will take a long time for things to return to normal . "
despite the prime minister 's passionate denunciation of israeli aggression in gaza , turkey has notably avoided any sanctions on israel , economic or diplomatic .

they have sewn the turkish national flag to the top - a mark of solidarity for those suffering in gaza .
" we are all palestinian now , " mustafa says .
" why is no-one stopping israel ? "
graffiti daubed in red paint on a nearby fence reads : " child killer israel . "
it 's just a fraction of the fury here at israel 's bombardment of gaza .
across the country , there have been regular demonstrations - some tens of thousands strong .
outside the israeli consulate , there is a noisy round-the-clock protest where demonstrators burn israeli flags and throw eggs .
there was a small explosion on monday at a nearby bank that 's part-owned by israel .
this week a teachers ' organisation from antalya sent a shoe to the consulate , as an insult .
most outspoken though has been prime minister recep tayyip erdogan himself .
they ask us why we do n't cut ties with israel ...
we are running the turkish republic , not a grocery store recep tayyip erdogan , turkish prime minister he has referred to israeli action in gaza as " savagery " , " a crime-against humanity " and " state terror , " and warned israel that it will " reap what it sows " .
" people say my statements are too harsh , " mr erdogan said on tuesday .
" they are no harsher than the phosphorus bombs used by israel .
" civilians and children are dying in gaza , " he added .
" those who keep their silence over these attacks out of whatever concern or for whatever diplomatic reason , will pay the price before history . "
support at risk with local elections due in march , a weak stance on the gaza offensive could lose mr erdogan 's ak party crucial support from more religious voters .
but the prime minister 's condemnation of israel strikes a chord with most turks , devout or otherwise .
it is difficult rhetoric for israel to swallow from an ally .
turkey was the first mainly muslim country to recognise israel .
in 1996 , the two countries signed an agreement forging strong defence and intelligence ties .
but israel 's offensive in gaza has caused outrage .
" there is a great deal of disappointment that there has not been one word of sympathy from turkey about the israelis , " a senior israeli diplomat told the bbc .
" its rhetoric has entirely sided with hamas .
even the arab countries talk about the need for both sides to stop the violence . "
in power since 2002 , mr erdogan 's party has worked to boost turkey 's role in the middle east .
it is in the interest of us both to maintain good relations .
but politically it will take a long time for things to return to normal israeli diplomat it has cultivated closer ties with iran and syria as well as israel .
immediately after the hamas election victory of 2006 , turkey invited its leader , khaled meshaal , to ankara - arguing the importance of engagement over isolation .
" i am sure the akp 's own religious background plays a role here , but its policy is that you have to reach out to everyone , " says soli ozel , international relations specialist at bilgi university .
that approach helped turkey mediate pre-talks about peace between syria and israel last year , now abandoned .
but some argue that turkey has now compromised its " honest-broker " credentials .
" the prime minister 's language has damaged turkey 's policy of equal distance from all partners , " mr ozel says .
" -lsb- that -rsb- can soothe burning hearts in turkey .
but it limits any steps ankara can take , or its influence in the future . "
central role turkey 's position has won it a crucial role in the gaza ceasefire talks , though .
the prime minister 's chief adviser has acted as the central conduit to hamas , shuttling between damascus and cairo as egypt tries to negotiate with israel .
un secretary general ban ki-moon is expected to discuss that process during his visit here on friday , including details of a mooted international monitoring presence on gaza 's border .
turkey has already volunteered troops .
" we will contribute to a monitoring force , " foreign ministry spokesman burak ozugergin confirms .
" but we did not offer any contribution to a peacekeeping force .
that is a whole new ball game .
we can discuss it if we arrive at that point . "
" child killer israel " is the graffiti daubed on this wall in istanbul every day , the turkish press carries graphic reports of the suffering in gaza .
local aid agencies have sent truckloads of aid in response .
the education ministry called an unprecedented minute 's silence in all schools this week for children dying in gaza .
anger at israel has at times spilled over into anti-semitism .
israeli diplomats say protesters delivered a petition on tuesday calling for the expulsion of all israelis from turkey and warning that they have a list of jewish business people to circulate .
graffiti on one city wall reads : " we do n't want you in turkey .
whore .
zionists .
scum . "
angry themselves at turkey 's attitude , israelis have reportedly cancelled business and tourist trips here .
but both sides agree their relationship will survive in the long run , when turkey has ambitions of helping to reconcile the competing palestinian factions hamas and fatah .
" it is in the interest of us both to maintain good relations , " an israeli diplomat explained .
" but politically it will take a long time for things to return to normal . "
despite the prime minister 's passionate denunciation of israeli aggression in gaza , turkey has notably avoided any sanctions on israel , economic or diplomatic .

artist jamie edwards , 32 , specialises in cityscapes and football grounds and made his trip before his club were given a trip to cardiff for the fa cup fourth round on 25 january .
his previous work includes the home grounds of clubs such as liverpool , chelsea , west ham and fulham .
cardiff are to move to a new stadium next season after almost 100 years .
gunners fan mr edwards , who produces prints of stadiums through his urban colours brand , said he felt passionate about football stadiums , and one day hoped to paint all 92 league grounds in wales and england . "
i think a lot of art that surrounds football is very dated and stuck in the 1970s and 1980s " jamie edwards " i 'm quite keen to capture these grounds before they go so it was the next one for me to do , " he said .
" the cardiff ground was fantastic to visit .
it 's just so modest and there 's that lovely park opposite .
" there 's also the new ground looming over it which highlights the difference in architectural styles . "
he believes stadiums can be an interesting subject due to their architecture and surroundings but , while he uses bold and contemporary colours , he said many artists produced old-fashioned pictures of football grounds .
" i think a lot of art that surrounds football is very dated and stuck in the 1970s and 1980s .
it needs updating , " he said .
" people sell the pictures to the fan on the basis of their support for the club , although that 's probably an injustice to some artists , but i do n't see how it fits in a modern home . "
mr edwards , whose prints include urban scenes in nottingham and bristol , said he always tried to include a stadium 's surroundings in his work .
flat building " the charlton ground is nice because there 's terraced housing , a block of flats and canary wharf in the background , " he said .
" i think that 's really important because some of the housing around clubs can be part of the history of the club . "
arsenal will also get a last chance to see ninian park at close quarters after the two sides were drawn together in the fourth round of the fa cup .
" i just thought ' blimey ' but i was quite pleased because i know where it -lsb- ninian park -rsb- is now , " he said .
" that could be the worst draw for arsenal , a championship team away from home . "
but he said he was unlikely to revisit ninian park for the match on 25 january because tickets would be scarce .

a report by the welsh affairs select committee found there was an investment gap of £ 61m in the year ending in 2006 .
it also found problems in policy-making between whitehall and cardiff .
the assembly government said funding was on a par with england , it had provided £ 449m this year and introduced ways to increase funding opportunities .
the report also found problems of communication and effective policy-making between whitehall and cardiff .
" there is a need for officials within whitehall to have a better understanding of devolution as there is an impression that some officials believe that it means that they can ' forget ' about wales , " said the report .
" similarly there is a need for officials and ministers in the welsh assembly to take a greater interest in developing policies across the border . "
summary of findings there are now " significant differences " between further education policies in wales and in england , and steps are needed to ensure that cross-border access is maintained and encouraged if a funding disparity - £ 61m - continues , higher education institutions in wales will become unable to compete effectively with colleges elsewhere in the uk and the eu " confusion " with the uk department of education having some uk-wide responsibilities and others england-only - " full consultation " needed with assembly government in early stages of policy the decision-making processes on each side of the border needs to be " more coordinated , more coherent and more transparent " there is a need for officials within whitehall to have a better understanding of devolution as there is an impression that some officials believe that it means that they can ' forget ' about wales the wales-england border should be a " cause for celebration and cooperation rather than an obstacle to efficiency and effectiveness " devolution provides an opportunity for wales to do things differently .. but the objective must be to do things better for the sake of learners " rather than being different just for the sake of it " source : welsh affairs committee - " cross-border provision of public services for wales : further and higher education " in the report , the mps predict a negative impact on the welsh economy if the country 's higher education continues to receive proportionately less core funding than english institutions and a smaller relative share of uk research funding .
david jones , the conservative mp for clwyd west and a member of the committee said wales would have to divert resources if it was going to grow an " effective higher education sector " .
" how the welsh assembly government does that is a matter for the welsh assembly government but i think what they 've got to do is recognise from the contents of this report that there 's is a big problem that is not just highlighted by the welsh affairs select committee but is also being highlighted by the university authorities themselves . "
the report claims that a lack of investment will also make institutions in wales less attractive because the quality of teaching staff and available resources will be affected .
the committee wants the uk 's department for innovation , universities and skills -lrb- dius -rrb- to make funds available to develop research in economically deprived areas .
it also calls for more effective communication between government departments and the assembly government to avoid confusion over further and higher education policy .
ben gray , president of the national union of students in wales said : " if i walk onto an english university campus i can see the difference in the buildings , i can see the difference in where the investment 's been spent .
" i think it 's clear to see from the research assessment exercise that just got released that wales is performing incredibly well in terms of it 's teaching quality and research capability , " he added .
but the assembly government disagreed with the committee 's findings and have claimed the level of funding is on a par with english levels .
a spokesperson said : " evidence suggests that we spend a comparable amount per head of population as in england .
" in 2008-09 , we made £ 449m available to higher education institutions via the higher education funding council for wales .
" we have also introduced a number of initiatives to increase the opportunities for funding available to higher education institutions in wales , such as a new scheme to encourage welsh universities to increase and expand their fundraising capacity . "

the assembly government said funding was on a par with england , it had provided £ 449m this year and introduced ways to increase funding opportunities .
the report also found problems of communication and effective policy-making between whitehall and cardiff .
" there is a need for officials within whitehall to have a better understanding of devolution as there is an impression that some officials believe that it means that they can ' forget ' about wales , " said the report .
" similarly there is a need for officials and ministers in the welsh assembly to take a greater interest in developing policies across the border . "
summary of findings there are now " significant differences " between further education policies in wales and in england , and steps are needed to ensure that cross-border access is maintained and encouraged if a funding disparity - £ 61m - continues , higher education institutions in wales will become unable to compete effectively with colleges elsewhere in the uk and the eu " confusion " with the uk department of education having some uk-wide responsibilities and others england-only - " full consultation " needed with assembly government in early stages of policy the decision-making processes on each side of the border needs to be " more coordinated , more coherent and more transparent " there is a need for officials within whitehall to have a better understanding of devolution as there is an impression that some officials believe that it means that they can ' forget ' about wales the wales-england border should be a " cause for celebration and cooperation rather than an obstacle to efficiency and effectiveness " devolution provides an opportunity for wales to do things differently .. but the objective must be to do things better for the sake of learners " rather than being different just for the sake of it " source : welsh affairs committee - " cross-border provision of public services for wales : further and higher education " in the report , the mps predict a negative impact on the welsh economy if the country 's higher education continues to receive proportionately less core funding than english institutions and a smaller relative share of uk research funding .
david jones , the conservative mp for clwyd west and a member of the committee said wales would have to divert resources if it was going to grow an " effective higher education sector " .
" how the welsh assembly government does that is a matter for the welsh assembly government but i think what they 've got to do is recognise from the contents of this report that there 's is a big problem that is not just highlighted by the welsh affairs select committee but is also being highlighted by the university authorities themselves . "
the report claims that a lack of investment will also make institutions in wales less attractive because the quality of teaching staff and available resources will be affected .
the committee wants the uk 's department for innovation , universities and skills -lrb- dius -rrb- to make funds available to develop research in economically deprived areas .
it also calls for more effective communication between government departments and the assembly government to avoid confusion over further and higher education policy .
ben gray , president of the national union of students in wales said : " if i walk onto an english university campus i can see the difference in the buildings , i can see the difference in where the investment 's been spent .
" i think it 's clear to see from the research assessment exercise that just got released that wales is performing incredibly well in terms of it 's teaching quality and research capability , " he added .
but the assembly government disagreed with the committee 's findings and have claimed the level of funding is on a par with english levels .
a spokesperson said : " evidence suggests that we spend a comparable amount per head of population as in england .
" in 2008-09 , we made £ 449m available to higher education institutions via the higher education funding council for wales .
" we have also introduced a number of initiatives to increase the opportunities for funding available to higher education institutions in wales , such as a new scheme to encourage welsh universities to increase and expand their fundraising capacity . "

this is the full text of the speech .
fellow citizens : for eight years , it has been my honour to serve as your president .
the first decade of this new century has been a period of consequence - a time set apart .
tonight , with a thankful heart , i have asked for a final opportunity to share some thoughts on the journey that we have travelled together , and the future of our nation .
five days from now , the world will witness the vitality of american democracy .
in a tradition dating back to our founding , the presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you , the american people .
standing on the steps of the capitol will be a man whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land .
this is a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation .
and i join all americans in offering best wishes to president-elect -lsb- barack -rsb- obama , his wife michelle , and their two beautiful girls .
tonight i am filled with gratitude - to vice-president -lsb- dick -rsb- cheney and members of my administration ; to laura , who brought joy to this house and love to my life ; to our wonderful daughters , barbara and jenna ; to my parents , whose examples have provided strength for a lifetime .
and above all , i thank the american people for the trust you have given me .
i thank you for the prayers that have lifted my spirits .
and i thank you for the countless acts of courage , generosity , and grace that i have witnessed these past eight years .
' brave souls ' this evening , my thoughts return to the first night i addressed you from this house - september 11 , 2001 .
that morning , terrorists took nearly 3,000 lives in the worst attack on america since pearl harbour .
i remember standing in the rubble of the world trade centre three days later , surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock .
i remember talking to brave souls who charged through smoke-filled corridors at the pentagon , and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard flight 93 . "
as the years passed , most americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
but i never did " i remember arlene howard , who gave me her fallen son 's police shield as a reminder of all that was lost .
and i still carry his badge .
as the years passed , most americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
but i never did .
every morning , i received a briefing on the threats to our nation .
i vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe .
over the past seven years , a new department of homeland security has been created .
the military , the intelligence community , and the fbi have been transformed .
our nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists ' movements , freeze their finances , and break up their plots .
and with strong allies at our side , we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them .
afghanistan has gone from a nation where the taleban harboured al-qaeda and stoned women in the streets , to a young democracy that is fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school .
iraq has gone from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of america , to an arab democracy at the heart of the middle east and a friend of the united states .
there is legitimate debate about many of these decisions .
but there can be little debate about the results .
america has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil .
this is a tribute to those who toil night and day to keep us safe - law enforcement officers , intelligence analysts , homeland security and diplomatic personnel , and the men and women of the united states armed forces .
our nation is blessed to have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger .
i have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families .
and america owes you a debt of gratitude .
and to all our men and women in uniform listening tonight : there has been no higher honour than serving as your commander-in-chief .
' campaigns of terror ' the battles waged by our troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different systems .
under one , a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology , condemns women to subservience , and marks unbelievers for murder .
the other system is based on the conviction that freedom is the universal gift of almighty god , and that liberty and justice light the path to peace .
this is the belief that gave birth to our nation .
and in the long run , advancing this belief is the only practical way to protect our citizens .
when people live in freedom , they do not willingly choose leaders who pursue campaigns of terror . "
this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations " when people have hope in the future , they will not cede their lives to violence and extremism .
so around the world , america is promoting human liberty , human rights , and human dignity .
we 're standing with dissidents and young democracies , providing aids medicine to dying patients - to bring dying patients back to life , and sparing mothers and babies from malaria .
and this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations .
for eight years , we 've also strived to expand opportunity and hope here at home .
across our country , students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools .
a new medicare prescription drug benefit is bringing peace of mind to seniors and the disabled .
every taxpayer pays lower income taxes .
the addicted and suffering are finding new hope through faith-based programmes .
vulnerable human life is better protected .
funding for our veterans has nearly doubled .
america 's air and water and lands are measurably cleaner .
and the federal bench includes wise new members like justice sam alito and chief justice john roberts .
when challenges to our prosperity emerged , we rose to meet them .
facing the prospect of a financial collapse , we took decisive measures to safeguard our economy .
these are very tough times for hardworking families , but the toll would be far worse if we had not acted .
all americans are in this together .
and together , with determination and hard work , we will restore our economy to the path of growth .
we will show the world once again the resilience of america 's free enterprise system .
' followed my conscience ' like all who have held this office before me , i have experienced setbacks .
there are things i would do differently if given the chance .
yet i 've always acted with the best interests of our country in mind .
i have followed my conscience and done what i thought was right .
you may not agree with some of the tough decisions i have made .
but i hope you can agree that i was willing to make the tough decisions .
the decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country , and there are some guiding principles that should shape our course .
while our nation is safer than it was seven years ago , the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack . "
in the 21st century , security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad " our enemies are patient , and determined to strike again .
america did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict .
but we have been given solemn responsibilities , and we must meet them .
we must resist complacency .
we must keep our resolve .
and we must never let down our guard .
at the same time , we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose .
in the face of threats from abroad , it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward .
but we must reject isolationism and its companion , protectionism .
retreating behind our borders would only invite danger .
in the 21st century , security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad .
if america does not lead the cause of freedom , that cause will not be led .
as we address these challenges - and others we can not foresee tonight - america must maintain our moral clarity .
i 've often spoken to you about good and evil , and this has made some uncomfortable .
but good and evil are present in this world , and between the two of them there can be no compromise .
murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time , everywhere .
freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right .
this nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth .
we must always be willing to act in their defence - and to advance the cause of peace .
renewal president thomas jefferson once wrote : " i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past . "
as i leave the house he occupied two centuries ago , i share that optimism .
america is a young country , full of vitality , constantly growing and renewing itself .
and even in the toughest times , we lift our eyes to the broad horizon ahead .
i have confidence in the promise of america because i know the character of our people . "
this is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger , and compassion in the face of suffering " this is a nation that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom .
this is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger , and compassion in the face of suffering .
we see examples of america 's character all around us .
and laura and i have invited some of them to join us in the white house this evening .
we see america 's character in dr tony recasner , a principal who opened a new charter school from the ruins of hurricane katrina .
we see it in julio medina , a former inmate who leads a faith-based program to help prisoners returning to society .
we 've seen it in staff sergeant aubrey mcdade , who charged into an ambush in iraq and rescued three of his fellow marines .
we see america 's character in bill krissoff , a surgeon from california .
his son , nathan , a marine , gave his life in iraq .
when i met dr krissoff and his family , he delivered some surprising news .
he told me he wanted to join the navy medical corps in honour of his son .
this good man was 60 years old - 18 years above the age limit .
but his petition for a waiver was granted , and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine .
lieutenant commander krissoff could not be here tonight , because he will soon deploy to iraq , where he will help save america 's wounded warriors - and uphold the legacy of his fallen son .
faith in america in citizens like these , we see the best of our country - resilient and hopeful , caring and strong .
these virtues give me an unshakable faith in america .
we have faced danger and trial , and there 's more ahead .
but with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideals , this great nation will never tire , never falter , and never fail .
it has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your president .
there have been good days and tough days .
but every day i have been inspired by the greatness of our country , and uplifted by the goodness of our people .
i have been blessed to represent this nation we love .
and i will always be honoured to carry a title that means more to me than any other - citizen of the united states of america .
and so , my fellow americans , for the final time : good night .
may god bless this house and our next president .
and may god bless you and our wonderful country .
thank you .

fellow citizens : for eight years , it has been my honour to serve as your president .
the first decade of this new century has been a period of consequence - a time set apart .
tonight , with a thankful heart , i have asked for a final opportunity to share some thoughts on the journey that we have travelled together , and the future of our nation .
five days from now , the world will witness the vitality of american democracy .
in a tradition dating back to our founding , the presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you , the american people .
standing on the steps of the capitol will be a man whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land .
this is a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation .
and i join all americans in offering best wishes to president-elect -lsb- barack -rsb- obama , his wife michelle , and their two beautiful girls .
tonight i am filled with gratitude - to vice-president -lsb- dick -rsb- cheney and members of my administration ; to laura , who brought joy to this house and love to my life ; to our wonderful daughters , barbara and jenna ; to my parents , whose examples have provided strength for a lifetime .
and above all , i thank the american people for the trust you have given me .
i thank you for the prayers that have lifted my spirits .
and i thank you for the countless acts of courage , generosity , and grace that i have witnessed these past eight years .
' brave souls ' this evening , my thoughts return to the first night i addressed you from this house - september 11 , 2001 .
that morning , terrorists took nearly 3,000 lives in the worst attack on america since pearl harbour .
i remember standing in the rubble of the world trade centre three days later , surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock .
i remember talking to brave souls who charged through smoke-filled corridors at the pentagon , and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard flight 93 .
as the years passed , most americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
but i never did i remember arlene howard , who gave me her fallen son 's police shield as a reminder of all that was lost .
and i still carry his badge .
as the years passed , most americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
but i never did .
every morning , i received a briefing on the threats to our nation .
i vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe .
over the past seven years , a new department of homeland security has been created .
the military , the intelligence community , and the fbi have been transformed .
our nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists ' movements , freeze their finances , and break up their plots .
and with strong allies at our side , we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them .
afghanistan has gone from a nation where the taleban harboured al-qaeda and stoned women in the streets , to a young democracy that is fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school .
iraq has gone from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of america , to an arab democracy at the heart of the middle east and a friend of the united states .
there is legitimate debate about many of these decisions .
but there can be little debate about the results .
america has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil .
this is a tribute to those who toil night and day to keep us safe - law enforcement officers , intelligence analysts , homeland security and diplomatic personnel , and the men and women of the united states armed forces .
our nation is blessed to have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger .
i have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families .
and america owes you a debt of gratitude .
and to all our men and women in uniform listening tonight : there has been no higher honour than serving as your commander-in-chief .
' campaigns of terror ' the battles waged by our troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different systems .
under one , a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology , condemns women to subservience , and marks unbelievers for murder .
the other system is based on the conviction that freedom is the universal gift of almighty god , and that liberty and justice light the path to peace .
this is the belief that gave birth to our nation .
and in the long run , advancing this belief is the only practical way to protect our citizens .
when people live in freedom , they do not willingly choose leaders who pursue campaigns of terror .
this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations when people have hope in the future , they will not cede their lives to violence and extremism .
so around the world , america is promoting human liberty , human rights , and human dignity .
we 're standing with dissidents and young democracies , providing aids medicine to dying patients - to bring dying patients back to life , and sparing mothers and babies from malaria .
and this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations .
for eight years , we 've also strived to expand opportunity and hope here at home .
across our country , students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools .
a new medicare prescription drug benefit is bringing peace of mind to seniors and the disabled .
every taxpayer pays lower income taxes .
the addicted and suffering are finding new hope through faith-based programmes .
vulnerable human life is better protected .
funding for our veterans has nearly doubled .
america 's air and water and lands are measurably cleaner .
and the federal bench includes wise new members like justice sam alito and chief justice john roberts .
when challenges to our prosperity emerged , we rose to meet them .
facing the prospect of a financial collapse , we took decisive measures to safeguard our economy .
these are very tough times for hardworking families , but the toll would be far worse if we had not acted .
all americans are in this together .
and together , with determination and hard work , we will restore our economy to the path of growth .
we will show the world once again the resilience of america 's free enterprise system .
' followed my conscience ' like all who have held this office before me , i have experienced setbacks .
there are things i would do differently if given the chance .
yet i 've always acted with the best interests of our country in mind .
i have followed my conscience and done what i thought was right .
you may not agree with some of the tough decisions i have made .
but i hope you can agree that i was willing to make the tough decisions .
the decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country , and there are some guiding principles that should shape our course .
while our nation is safer than it was seven years ago , the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack .
in the 21st century , security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad our enemies are patient , and determined to strike again .
america did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict .
but we have been given solemn responsibilities , and we must meet them .
we must resist complacency .
we must keep our resolve .
and we must never let down our guard .
at the same time , we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose .
in the face of threats from abroad , it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward .
but we must reject isolationism and its companion , protectionism .
retreating behind our borders would only invite danger .
in the 21st century , security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad .
if america does not lead the cause of freedom , that cause will not be led .
as we address these challenges - and others we can not foresee tonight - america must maintain our moral clarity .
i 've often spoken to you about good and evil , and this has made some uncomfortable .
but good and evil are present in this world , and between the two of them there can be no compromise .
murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time , everywhere .
freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right .
this nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth .
we must always be willing to act in their defence - and to advance the cause of peace .
renewal president thomas jefferson once wrote : " i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past . "
as i leave the house he occupied two centuries ago , i share that optimism .
america is a young country , full of vitality , constantly growing and renewing itself .
and even in the toughest times , we lift our eyes to the broad horizon ahead .
i have confidence in the promise of america because i know the character of our people .
this is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger , and compassion in the face of suffering this is a nation that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom .
this is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger , and compassion in the face of suffering .
we see examples of america 's character all around us .
and laura and i have invited some of them to join us in the white house this evening .
we see america 's character in dr tony recasner , a principal who opened a new charter school from the ruins of hurricane katrina .
we see it in julio medina , a former inmate who leads a faith-based program to help prisoners returning to society .
we 've seen it in staff sergeant aubrey mcdade , who charged into an ambush in iraq and rescued three of his fellow marines .
we see america 's character in bill krissoff , a surgeon from california .
his son , nathan , a marine , gave his life in iraq .
when i met dr krissoff and his family , he delivered some surprising news .
he told me he wanted to join the navy medical corps in honour of his son .
this good man was 60 years old - 18 years above the age limit .
but his petition for a waiver was granted , and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine .
lieutenant commander krissoff could not be here tonight , because he will soon deploy to iraq , where he will help save america 's wounded warriors - and uphold the legacy of his fallen son .
faith in america in citizens like these , we see the best of our country - resilient and hopeful , caring and strong .
these virtues give me an unshakable faith in america .
we have faced danger and trial , and there 's more ahead .
but with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideals , this great nation will never tire , never falter , and never fail .
it has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your president .
there have been good days and tough days .
but every day i have been inspired by the greatness of our country , and uplifted by the goodness of our people .
i have been blessed to represent this nation we love .
and i will always be honoured to carry a title that means more to me than any other - citizen of the united states of america .
and so , my fellow americans , for the final time : good night .
may god bless this house and our next president .
and may god bless you and our wonderful country .
thank you .

this is the full text of the speech .
fellow citizens : for eight years , it has been my honour to serve as your president .
the first decade of this new century has been a period of consequence - a time set apart .
tonight , with a thankful heart , i have asked for a final opportunity to share some thoughts on the journey that we have travelled together , and the future of our nation .
five days from now , the world will witness the vitality of american democracy .
in a tradition dating back to our founding , the presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you , the american people .
standing on the steps of the capitol will be a man whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land .
this is a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation .
and i join all americans in offering best wishes to president-elect -lsb- barack -rsb- obama , his wife michelle , and their two beautiful girls .
tonight i am filled with gratitude - to vice-president -lsb- dick -rsb- cheney and members of my administration ; to laura , who brought joy to this house and love to my life ; to our wonderful daughters , barbara and jenna ; to my parents , whose examples have provided strength for a lifetime .
and above all , i thank the american people for the trust you have given me .
i thank you for the prayers that have lifted my spirits .
and i thank you for the countless acts of courage , generosity , and grace that i have witnessed these past eight years .
' brave souls ' this evening , my thoughts return to the first night i addressed you from this house - september 11 , 2001 .
that morning , terrorists took nearly 3,000 lives in the worst attack on america since pearl harbour .
i remember standing in the rubble of the world trade centre three days later , surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock .
i remember talking to brave souls who charged through smoke-filled corridors at the pentagon , and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard flight 93 .
as the years passed , most americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
but i never did i remember arlene howard , who gave me her fallen son 's police shield as a reminder of all that was lost .
and i still carry his badge .
as the years passed , most americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
but i never did .
every morning , i received a briefing on the threats to our nation .
i vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe .
over the past seven years , a new department of homeland security has been created .
the military , the intelligence community , and the fbi have been transformed .
our nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists ' movements , freeze their finances , and break up their plots .
and with strong allies at our side , we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them .
afghanistan has gone from a nation where the taleban harboured al-qaeda and stoned women in the streets , to a young democracy that is fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school .
iraq has gone from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of america , to an arab democracy at the heart of the middle east and a friend of the united states .
there is legitimate debate about many of these decisions .
but there can be little debate about the results .
america has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil .
this is a tribute to those who toil night and day to keep us safe - law enforcement officers , intelligence analysts , homeland security and diplomatic personnel , and the men and women of the united states armed forces .
our nation is blessed to have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger .
i have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families .
and america owes you a debt of gratitude .
and to all our men and women in uniform listening tonight : there has been no higher honour than serving as your commander-in-chief .

this good man was 60 years old - 18 years above the age limit .
but his petition for a waiver was granted , and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine .
lieutenant commander krissoff could not be here tonight , because he will soon deploy to iraq , where he will help save america 's wounded warriors - and uphold the legacy of his fallen son .
faith in america in citizens like these , we see the best of our country - resilient and hopeful , caring and strong .
these virtues give me an unshakable faith in america .
we have faced danger and trial , and there 's more ahead .
but with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideals , this great nation will never tire , never falter , and never fail .
it has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your president .
there have been good days and tough days .
but every day i have been inspired by the greatness of our country , and uplifted by the goodness of our people .
i have been blessed to represent this nation we love .
and i will always be honoured to carry a title that means more to me than any other - citizen of the united states of america .
and so , my fellow americans , for the final time : good night .
may god bless this house and our next president .
and may god bless you and our wonderful country .
thank you .

this is the full text of the speech .
fellow citizens : for eight years , it has been my honour to serve as your president .
the first decade of this new century has been a period of consequence - a time set apart .
tonight , with a thankful heart , i have asked for a final opportunity to share some thoughts on the journey that we have travelled together , and the future of our nation .
five days from now , the world will witness the vitality of american democracy .
in a tradition dating back to our founding , the presidency will pass to a successor chosen by you , the american people .
standing on the steps of the capitol will be a man whose history reflects the enduring promise of our land .
this is a moment of hope and pride for our whole nation .
and i join all americans in offering best wishes to president-elect -lsb- barack -rsb- obama , his wife michelle , and their two beautiful girls .
tonight i am filled with gratitude - to vice-president -lsb- dick -rsb- cheney and members of my administration ; to laura , who brought joy to this house and love to my life ; to our wonderful daughters , barbara and jenna ; to my parents , whose examples have provided strength for a lifetime .
and above all , i thank the american people for the trust you have given me .
i thank you for the prayers that have lifted my spirits .
and i thank you for the countless acts of courage , generosity , and grace that i have witnessed these past eight years .
' brave souls ' this evening , my thoughts return to the first night i addressed you from this house - september 11 , 2001 .
that morning , terrorists took nearly 3,000 lives in the worst attack on america since pearl harbour .
i remember standing in the rubble of the world trade centre three days later , surrounded by rescuers who had been working around the clock .
i remember talking to brave souls who charged through smoke-filled corridors at the pentagon , and to husbands and wives whose loved ones became heroes aboard flight 93 .
as the years passed , most americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
but i never did i remember arlene howard , who gave me her fallen son 's police shield as a reminder of all that was lost .
and i still carry his badge .
as the years passed , most americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11 .
but i never did .
every morning , i received a briefing on the threats to our nation .
i vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe .
over the past seven years , a new department of homeland security has been created .
the military , the intelligence community , and the fbi have been transformed .
our nation is equipped with new tools to monitor the terrorists ' movements , freeze their finances , and break up their plots .
and with strong allies at our side , we have taken the fight to the terrorists and those who support them .
afghanistan has gone from a nation where the taleban harboured al-qaeda and stoned women in the streets , to a young democracy that is fighting terror and encouraging girls to go to school .
iraq has gone from a brutal dictatorship and a sworn enemy of america , to an arab democracy at the heart of the middle east and a friend of the united states .
there is legitimate debate about many of these decisions .
but there can be little debate about the results .
america has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil .
this is a tribute to those who toil night and day to keep us safe - law enforcement officers , intelligence analysts , homeland security and diplomatic personnel , and the men and women of the united states armed forces .
our nation is blessed to have citizens who volunteer to defend us in this time of danger .
i have cherished meeting these selfless patriots and their families .
and america owes you a debt of gratitude .
and to all our men and women in uniform listening tonight : there has been no higher honour than serving as your commander-in-chief .
' campaigns of terror ' the battles waged by our troops are part of a broader struggle between two dramatically different systems .
under one , a small band of fanatics demands total obedience to an oppressive ideology , condemns women to subservience , and marks unbelievers for murder .
the other system is based on the conviction that freedom is the universal gift of almighty god , and that liberty and justice light the path to peace .
this is the belief that gave birth to our nation .
and in the long run , advancing this belief is the only practical way to protect our citizens .
when people live in freedom , they do not willingly choose leaders who pursue campaigns of terror .
this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations when people have hope in the future , they will not cede their lives to violence and extremism .
so around the world , america is promoting human liberty , human rights , and human dignity .
we 're standing with dissidents and young democracies , providing aids medicine to dying patients - to bring dying patients back to life , and sparing mothers and babies from malaria .
and this great republic born alone in liberty is leading the world toward a new age when freedom belongs to all nations .
for eight years , we 've also strived to expand opportunity and hope here at home .
across our country , students are rising to meet higher standards in public schools .
a new medicare prescription drug benefit is bringing peace of mind to seniors and the disabled .
every taxpayer pays lower income taxes .
the addicted and suffering are finding new hope through faith-based programmes .
vulnerable human life is better protected .
funding for our veterans has nearly doubled .
america 's air and water and lands are measurably cleaner .
and the federal bench includes wise new members like justice sam alito and chief justice john roberts .
when challenges to our prosperity emerged , we rose to meet them .
facing the prospect of a financial collapse , we took decisive measures to safeguard our economy .
these are very tough times for hardworking families , but the toll would be far worse if we had not acted .
all americans are in this together .
and together , with determination and hard work , we will restore our economy to the path of growth .
we will show the world once again the resilience of america 's free enterprise system .
' followed my conscience ' like all who have held this office before me , i have experienced setbacks .
there are things i would do differently if given the chance .
yet i 've always acted with the best interests of our country in mind .
i have followed my conscience and done what i thought was right .
you may not agree with some of the tough decisions i have made .
but i hope you can agree that i was willing to make the tough decisions .
the decades ahead will bring more hard choices for our country , and there are some guiding principles that should shape our course .
while our nation is safer than it was seven years ago , the gravest threat to our people remains another terrorist attack .
in the 21st century , security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad our enemies are patient , and determined to strike again .
america did nothing to seek or deserve this conflict .
but we have been given solemn responsibilities , and we must meet them .
we must resist complacency .
we must keep our resolve .
and we must never let down our guard .
at the same time , we must continue to engage the world with confidence and clear purpose .
in the face of threats from abroad , it can be tempting to seek comfort by turning inward .
but we must reject isolationism and its companion , protectionism .
retreating behind our borders would only invite danger .
in the 21st century , security and prosperity at home depend on the expansion of liberty abroad .
if america does not lead the cause of freedom , that cause will not be led .
as we address these challenges - and others we can not foresee tonight - america must maintain our moral clarity .
i 've often spoken to you about good and evil , and this has made some uncomfortable .
but good and evil are present in this world , and between the two of them there can be no compromise .
murdering the innocent to advance an ideology is wrong every time , everywhere .
freeing people from oppression and despair is eternally right .
this nation must continue to speak out for justice and truth .
we must always be willing to act in their defence - and to advance the cause of peace .
renewal president thomas jefferson once wrote : " i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past . "
as i leave the house he occupied two centuries ago , i share that optimism .
america is a young country , full of vitality , constantly growing and renewing itself .
and even in the toughest times , we lift our eyes to the broad horizon ahead .
i have confidence in the promise of america because i know the character of our people .
this is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger , and compassion in the face of suffering this is a nation that inspires immigrants to risk everything for the dream of freedom .
this is a nation where citizens show calm in times of danger , and compassion in the face of suffering .
we see examples of america 's character all around us .
and laura and i have invited some of them to join us in the white house this evening .
we see america 's character in dr tony recasner , a principal who opened a new charter school from the ruins of hurricane katrina .
we see it in julio medina , a former inmate who leads a faith-based program to help prisoners returning to society .
we 've seen it in staff sergeant aubrey mcdade , who charged into an ambush in iraq and rescued three of his fellow marines .
we see america 's character in bill krissoff , a surgeon from california .
his son , nathan , a marine , gave his life in iraq .
when i met dr krissoff and his family , he delivered some surprising news .
he told me he wanted to join the navy medical corps in honour of his son .
this good man was 60 years old - 18 years above the age limit .
but his petition for a waiver was granted , and for the past year he has trained in battlefield medicine .
lieutenant commander krissoff could not be here tonight , because he will soon deploy to iraq , where he will help save america 's wounded warriors - and uphold the legacy of his fallen son .
faith in america in citizens like these , we see the best of our country - resilient and hopeful , caring and strong .
these virtues give me an unshakable faith in america .
we have faced danger and trial , and there 's more ahead .
but with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideals , this great nation will never tire , never falter , and never fail .
it has been the privilege of a lifetime to serve as your president .

i have been blessed to represent this nation we love .
and i will always be honoured to carry a title that means more to me than any other - citizen of the united states of america .
and so , my fellow americans , for the final time : good night .
may god bless this house and our next president .
and may god bless you and our wonderful country .
thank you .
