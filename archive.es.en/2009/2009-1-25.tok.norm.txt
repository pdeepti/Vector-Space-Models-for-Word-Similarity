26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .
international but not universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc was founded in 2002 operating under the auspices of the united nations , the icc was established by the statute of rome in 1998 , an international agreement that has been signed by 108 countries , excluding , among others , the united states , china and russia .
since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .
the court has a total of 17 judges and is presided over by canadian judge philippe kirsch . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another woman died because a machine that helped her breathe cut out when the power failed . however , weather officials said there would have been more deaths if their early warning system had not worked so well .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .
one elderly man , who now lives in northern germany , told the afp that he believed his grandmother was among the dead . " i hope she will finally get a decent burial , and that it will be in marienburg , her home town , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews .

it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .

bilateral trade and investment , development cooperation and cultural initiatives between bangladesh and germany will top the agenda for official talks , scheduled for january 28 .
trade between the two countries is increasing with germany now the second biggest export destination for bangladesh after the united states .
although ready-made clothing make up the bulk of bangladesh 's exports , the south asian nation is also hoping to expand trade with germany in other sectors .
dhaka received a significant number of orders for shipbuilding from germany , which imports textile machinery , chemicals and solutions for green energy among others to bangladesh .
trade between the two countries increased by 16 percent in the first half of 2008 .
bilateral trade volume amounted to $ 2 billion in 2007 , according to the german embassy in dhaka .
new opportunities in education silberberg , who was assigned as a junior officer of the german foreign ministry in dhaka in the early 1980s , visits bangladesh at a time when a newly elected government of prime minister sheikh hasina wazed has taken office , ending two years of rule by a military backed interim administration .
bangladesh 's new government wants stronger cooperation with its development partners .
earlier this week , german and bangladeshi education experts meeting in dhaka called for further cooperation with colleges in germany to improve cooperation in education and scientific research .
" carrying out fundamental and innovative research in a number of areas between the two nations would help us keep pace with present global order , " said professor nazrul islam , chairman of the university grants commission -lrb- ugc -rrb- , which regulates the allocation of funds for bangladesh 's public universities .
islam , a geography professor , identified environment , genetic engineering , bio-technology and molecular science as fields where scholars from the two countries could take up joint research initiatives .
senior professors from a number of public and private universities who attended the meeting , said the recent interest shown by german universities in their bangladeshi counterparts presented opportunities for cooperation .
the meeting in dhaka was jointly organized by germany 's hamburg university and the bangladesh development forum .
hamburg university representative professor hans peter muehlbach said the institution was keen to work with bangladeshi researchers .
" we have plans to set up a research unit in bangladesh to create opportunities for experts as well as students sharing our technologies , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bilateral trade and investment , development cooperation and cultural initiatives between bangladesh and germany will top the agenda for official talks , scheduled for january 28 .
trade between the two countries is increasing with germany now the second biggest export destination for bangladesh after the united states .
although ready-made clothing make up the bulk of bangladesh 's exports , the south asian nation is also hoping to expand trade with germany in other sectors .
dhaka received a significant number of orders for shipbuilding from germany , which imports textile machinery , chemicals and solutions for green energy among others to bangladesh .
trade between the two countries increased by 16 percent in the first half of 2008 .
bilateral trade volume amounted to $ 2 billion in 2007 , according to the german embassy in dhaka .
new opportunities in education silberberg , who was assigned as a junior officer of the german foreign ministry in dhaka in the early 1980s , visits bangladesh at a time when a newly elected government of prime minister sheikh hasina wazed has taken office , ending two years of rule by a military backed interim administration .
bangladesh 's new government wants stronger cooperation with its development partners .
earlier this week , german and bangladeshi education experts meeting in dhaka called for further cooperation with colleges in germany to improve cooperation in education and scientific research .
" carrying out fundamental and innovative research in a number of areas between the two nations would help us keep pace with present global order , " said professor nazrul islam , chairman of the university grants commission -lrb- ugc -rrb- , which regulates the allocation of funds for bangladesh 's public universities .
islam , a geography professor , identified environment , genetic engineering , bio-technology and molecular science as fields where scholars from the two countries could take up joint research initiatives .
senior professors from a number of public and private universities who attended the meeting , said the recent interest shown by german universities in their bangladeshi counterparts presented opportunities for cooperation .
the meeting in dhaka was jointly organized by germany 's hamburg university and the bangladesh development forum .
hamburg university representative professor hans peter muehlbach said the institution was keen to work with bangladeshi researchers .
" we have plans to set up a research unit in bangladesh to create opportunities for experts as well as students sharing our technologies , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .
one elderly man , who now lives in northern germany , told the afp that he believed his grandmother was among the dead . " i hope she will finally get a decent burial , and that it will be in marienburg , her home town , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luxury yacht makers said they 're confident the recession wo n't sink their clientele 's spending habits . some 1,650 exhibitors from 55 countries are vying for visitors ' attention at the 40th boat trade fair , called boot düsseldorf , which runs through sunday , jan .

bilateral trade and investment , development cooperation and cultural initiatives between bangladesh and germany will top the agenda for official talks , scheduled for january 28 .
trade between the two countries is increasing with germany now the second biggest export destination for bangladesh after the united states .
although ready-made clothing make up the bulk of bangladesh 's exports , the south asian nation is also hoping to expand trade with germany in other sectors .
dhaka received a significant number of orders for shipbuilding from germany , which imports textile machinery , chemicals and solutions for green energy among others to bangladesh .
trade between the two countries increased by 16 percent in the first half of 2008 .
bilateral trade volume amounted to $ 2 billion in 2007 , according to the german embassy in dhaka .
new opportunities in education silberberg , who was assigned as a junior officer of the german foreign ministry in dhaka in the early 1980s , visits bangladesh at a time when a newly elected government of prime minister sheikh hasina wazed has taken office , ending two years of rule by a military backed interim administration .
bangladesh 's new government wants stronger cooperation with its development partners .
earlier this week , german and bangladeshi education experts meeting in dhaka called for further cooperation with colleges in germany to improve cooperation in education and scientific research .
" carrying out fundamental and innovative research in a number of areas between the two nations would help us keep pace with present global order , " said professor nazrul islam , chairman of the university grants commission -lrb- ugc -rrb- , which regulates the allocation of funds for bangladesh 's public universities .
islam , a geography professor , identified environment , genetic engineering , bio-technology and molecular science as fields where scholars from the two countries could take up joint research initiatives .
senior professors from a number of public and private universities who attended the meeting , said the recent interest shown by german universities in their bangladeshi counterparts presented opportunities for cooperation .
the meeting in dhaka was jointly organized by germany 's hamburg university and the bangladesh development forum .
hamburg university representative professor hans peter muehlbach said the institution was keen to work with bangladeshi researchers .
" we have plans to set up a research unit in bangladesh to create opportunities for experts as well as students sharing our technologies , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luxury yacht makers said they 're confident the recession wo n't sink their clientele 's spending habits . some 1,650 exhibitors from 55 countries are vying for visitors ' attention at the 40th boat trade fair , called boot düsseldorf , which runs through sunday , jan .
25 .
but it 's still the luxury yachts , not the canoes or even the sailboats , that set mouths agape . the ships , whose price tags hover between hundreds and millions of euros , will remain out of reach for most the fair 's guests , but that has n't kept them from kicking off their shoes in an old sailing tradition and getting a closer look at the vessels like the 2b . nearly 28 meters -lrb- 92 feet -rrb- long , the ship offers the best of everything according andreas schmidt , the vice-president of drettmann group , which makes the 160-ton yacht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2b 's living room offers the comforts of home " whether its material from jaap or motors from man , we buy all the materials you can see here in europe , " he said , adding that the yacht has to set itself apart to justify its price of about 1 million euros .
" the future owner can choose everything from the motor to the silverware . " while sales for luxury yachts , equipped like the 2b with walk-in closets , a television in every room and even the possibility of an elevator or sauna , have n't experienced much of a drop as potential buyers tend to be wealthy enough to weather the recession , sales of mid-class vessels have been harder hit , schmidt said . drop in sales expected for 2009 sales generated by the yacht and water sports industry , but excluding superyachts , are expected to have dropped in 2008 by just under two percent to 1.84 billion euros compared to the previous year , according to the statistics from the german federal association of the water sports industry -lrb- bvww -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry-wide forecasts for 2009 predict a decline in sales the organization 's managing director , juergen tracht , anticipated that 2009 would also see a fall in sales , " which , if the rosier view is adopted , will be limited to single digits , " he said in a statement . sales of heating , refrigeration , cooking and sanitary facilities as well as multimedia systems are also gaining in importance as boat owners make investments in their current vessels rather than buying new ships , according to the bvww . ship shape for the future ? boat trade fair head goetz-ulf jungmichel said the industry as a whole could be passing through the final waves of its stormy seas . " our clientele has certainly become more cautious , " he said .
" but optimism is returning . " schmidt is among the more optimistic exhibitors at the trade fair , which this year saw a drop in floor-space rental and exhibiting companies . " the people who lost a lot of money will be the first to make it back , " he said .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

24 a major storm took the lives of people in spain , france and germany this weekend .
millions more are recovering from the damage sunday , jan .
25 , in the wake of a storm dubbed klaus by weather officials . the storm , which produced wind speeds of up to 194 kilometers per hour -lrb- km / h -rrb- as it tore across europe , left a swath of destruction in its wake , with roads blocked , buildings destroyed , phone service out in much of southern france and train passengers returning home after spending much of saturday in immobilized trains . eighteen people are thought to have died .
spain suffered the highest death toll . four children were killed when the roof of a sports hall collapsed in the town of sant boi de llobregat near barcelona on saturday .
two adult trainers and 13 children were injured . radio reports said about 30 people were in the indoor arena when the incident happened , seeking shelter from the storm . eight other deaths friday in spain included : a traffic officer killed by a falling tree ; a 52-year-old woman crushed in central barcelona when a wall collapsed on her ; and a fishermen who died during a rescue operation .

two car drivers were killed when their vehicles were hit by tree .
another woman died because a machine that helped her breathe cut out when the power failed . however , weather officials said there would have been more deaths if their early warning system had not worked so well .

some families were homeless after the storm ripped the roofs off their houses . authorities lifted bans on road use in france , though they noted that many trees continued to be in danger of collapse . in spain , winds intensified two wildfires , forcing 15,000 people to evacuate their homes .
in galicia , a school and a swimming pool lost their roofs . experts , in radio reports , compared the storm to a devastating winter storm which struck france and other parts of western and central europe in 1999 .
climate experts said the storm 's destructive strength was further proof of the dangers of climate change . dpa news agency -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .
international but not universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc was founded in 2002 operating under the auspices of the united nations , the icc was established by the statute of rome in 1998 , an international agreement that has been signed by 108 countries , excluding , among others , the united states , china and russia .
since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .
the court has a total of 17 judges and is presided over by canadian judge philippe kirsch . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bilateral trade and investment , development cooperation and cultural initiatives between bangladesh and germany will top the agenda for official talks , scheduled for january 28 .
trade between the two countries is increasing with germany now the second biggest export destination for bangladesh after the united states .

dhaka received a significant number of orders for shipbuilding from germany , which imports textile machinery , chemicals and solutions for green energy among others to bangladesh .
trade between the two countries increased by 16 percent in the first half of 2008 .
bilateral trade volume amounted to $ 2 billion in 2007 , according to the german embassy in dhaka .

bangladesh 's new government wants stronger cooperation with its development partners .
earlier this week , german and bangladeshi education experts meeting in dhaka called for further cooperation with colleges in germany to improve cooperation in education and scientific research .
" carrying out fundamental and innovative research in a number of areas between the two nations would help us keep pace with present global order , " said professor nazrul islam , chairman of the university grants commission -lrb- ugc -rrb- , which regulates the allocation of funds for bangladesh 's public universities .
islam , a geography professor , identified environment , genetic engineering , bio-technology and molecular science as fields where scholars from the two countries could take up joint research initiatives .
senior professors from a number of public and private universities who attended the meeting , said the recent interest shown by german universities in their bangladeshi counterparts presented opportunities for cooperation .
the meeting in dhaka was jointly organized by germany 's hamburg university and the bangladesh development forum .
hamburg university representative professor hans peter muehlbach said the institution was keen to work with bangladeshi researchers .
" we have plans to set up a research unit in bangladesh to create opportunities for experts as well as students sharing our technologies , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .
international but not universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc was founded in 2002 operating under the auspices of the united nations , the icc was established by the statute of rome in 1998 , an international agreement that has been signed by 108 countries , excluding , among others , the united states , china and russia .
since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .
the court has a total of 17 judges and is presided over by canadian judge philippe kirsch . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hair decree , as it is called , comes into force on ash wednesday , feb .
25 .
some 2,500 villagers have applied to take part in the next staging of the play from may to october 2010 , according to its artistic director , christian stueckl .
" that is 300 more than we had the last time the play was performed in 2000 , " he told a press conference in munich , outlining details of his third term in charge of the production .
the passion play has been performed every decade since 1634 by the inhabitants of the village of oberammergau in the southern german state of bavaria .
its origin dates back to the thirty years war when the village was decimated by the bubonic plague .
the surviving population promised god that if he saved them they would commemorate it by staging a dramatic representation of christ 's suffering , death and resurrection every ten years .
the only time the play was not performed was during world war ii .
local actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2010 play will be the third one directed by christian stueckl the entire cast consists of villagers who live permanently in oberammergau , which has a population of 5,000 .
they must also be amateurs and people of high moral and ethical principles .
a requirement restricting the roles to christians was dropped in 2000 , when young muslims living in the predominantly catholic village were allowed to appear in the play for the first time .
stueckl altered the text of the 2000 version to remove passages that in the past offended jewish groups with their depiction of jews as christ-killers , giving the play an anti-semitic slant .
the artistic director also plans to change the text for the new season , placing less emphasis on the " revolutionary aspect " of jesus in favor of showing the " consequential way that christ lived his life , right up to his crucifixion . "
the oberammergau passion play is performed in german and runs for five-and-a-half hours , with a three-hour break .
in the past it was staged during the morning and afternoon .
controversial change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing the play schedule required a village referendum for the first time , the 2010 version will be performed in the afternoon and evening , a change which caused a lot of controversy , according to the play 's spokesman frederik mayet .
" the issue was put to a referendum , in which 4,000 people took part , " mayet said .
" sixty-five per cent were in favor on the new schedule . "
the final cast selection is due to be made on april 18 , with rehearsals scheduled to begin in october .
stueckl has also designed a new setting for the production , but will continue to use the colorful costumes designed and made by villagers for the 2000 staging .
more than half-a-million visitors , many from abroad , are expected to descend on the picturesque alpine village for the 100 performances , paying between 49.5 euros -lrb- $ 65 -rrb- and 165 euros -lrb- $ 214 -rrb- for tickets .
passion plays have been staged since the 12th century and often give a detailed portrayal of christ 's physical suffering .
many of them include explicit dramatizations of the beating and execution of christ . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bilateral trade and investment , development cooperation and cultural initiatives between bangladesh and germany will top the agenda for official talks , scheduled for january 28 .
trade between the two countries is increasing with germany now the second biggest export destination for bangladesh after the united states .
although ready-made clothing make up the bulk of bangladesh 's exports , the south asian nation is also hoping to expand trade with germany in other sectors .
dhaka received a significant number of orders for shipbuilding from germany , which imports textile machinery , chemicals and solutions for green energy among others to bangladesh .
trade between the two countries increased by 16 percent in the first half of 2008 .
bilateral trade volume amounted to $ 2 billion in 2007 , according to the german embassy in dhaka .
new opportunities in education silberberg , who was assigned as a junior officer of the german foreign ministry in dhaka in the early 1980s , visits bangladesh at a time when a newly elected government of prime minister sheikh hasina wazed has taken office , ending two years of rule by a military backed interim administration .
bangladesh 's new government wants stronger cooperation with its development partners .
earlier this week , german and bangladeshi education experts meeting in dhaka called for further cooperation with colleges in germany to improve cooperation in education and scientific research .
" carrying out fundamental and innovative research in a number of areas between the two nations would help us keep pace with present global order , " said professor nazrul islam , chairman of the university grants commission -lrb- ugc -rrb- , which regulates the allocation of funds for bangladesh 's public universities .
islam , a geography professor , identified environment , genetic engineering , bio-technology and molecular science as fields where scholars from the two countries could take up joint research initiatives .
senior professors from a number of public and private universities who attended the meeting , said the recent interest shown by german universities in their bangladeshi counterparts presented opportunities for cooperation .
the meeting in dhaka was jointly organized by germany 's hamburg university and the bangladesh development forum .
hamburg university representative professor hans peter muehlbach said the institution was keen to work with bangladeshi researchers .
" we have plans to set up a research unit in bangladesh to create opportunities for experts as well as students sharing our technologies , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .
one elderly man , who now lives in northern germany , told the afp that he believed his grandmother was among the dead .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .
one elderly man , who now lives in northern germany , told the afp that he believed his grandmother was among the dead . " i hope she will finally get a decent burial , and that it will be in marienburg , her home town , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .
one elderly man , who now lives in northern germany , told the afp that he believed his grandmother was among the dead . " i hope she will finally get a decent burial , and that it will be in marienburg , her home town , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luxury yacht makers said they 're confident the recession wo n't sink their clientele 's spending habits . some 1,650 exhibitors from 55 countries are vying for visitors ' attention at the 40th boat trade fair , called boot düsseldorf , which runs through sunday , jan .
25 .
but it 's still the luxury yachts , not the canoes or even the sailboats , that set mouths agape . the ships , whose price tags hover between hundreds and millions of euros , will remain out of reach for most the fair 's guests , but that has n't kept them from kicking off their shoes in an old sailing tradition and getting a closer look at the vessels like the 2b . nearly 28 meters -lrb- 92 feet -rrb- long , the ship offers the best of everything according andreas schmidt , the vice-president of drettmann group , which makes the 160-ton yacht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2b 's living room offers the comforts of home " whether its material from jaap or motors from man , we buy all the materials you can see here in europe , " he said , adding that the yacht has to set itself apart to justify its price of about 1 million euros .
" the future owner can choose everything from the motor to the silverware . " while sales for luxury yachts , equipped like the 2b with walk-in closets , a television in every room and even the possibility of an elevator or sauna , have n't experienced much of a drop as potential buyers tend to be wealthy enough to weather the recession , sales of mid-class vessels have been harder hit , schmidt said . drop in sales expected for 2009 sales generated by the yacht and water sports industry , but excluding superyachts , are expected to have dropped in 2008 by just under two percent to 1.84 billion euros compared to the previous year , according to the statistics from the german federal association of the water sports industry -lrb- bvww -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry-wide forecasts for 2009 predict a decline in sales the organization 's managing director , juergen tracht , anticipated that 2009 would also see a fall in sales , " which , if the rosier view is adopted , will be limited to single digits , " he said in a statement . sales of heating , refrigeration , cooking and sanitary facilities as well as multimedia systems are also gaining in importance as boat owners make investments in their current vessels rather than buying new ships , according to the bvww . ship shape for the future ? boat trade fair head goetz-ulf jungmichel said the industry as a whole could be passing through the final waves of its stormy seas . " our clientele has certainly become more cautious , " he said .
" but optimism is returning . " schmidt is among the more optimistic exhibitors at the trade fair , which this year saw a drop in floor-space rental and exhibiting companies . " the people who lost a lot of money will be the first to make it back , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 25.01.2009 polish workers discover mass grave from world war two großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3,000 ethnic germans remained in malbork , as the soviet army advanced in 1945 the remains of 1,800 bodies were exhumed from a mass grave in a polish city that was part of the german reich during the war .
historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .
one elderly man , who now lives in northern germany , told the afp that he believed his grandmother was among the dead . " i hope she will finally get a decent burial , and that it will be in marienburg , her home town , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luxury yacht makers said they 're confident the recession wo n't sink their clientele 's spending habits . some 1,650 exhibitors from 55 countries are vying for visitors ' attention at the 40th boat trade fair , called boot düsseldorf , which runs through sunday , jan .
25 .
but it 's still the luxury yachts , not the canoes or even the sailboats , that set mouths agape . the ships , whose price tags hover between hundreds and millions of euros , will remain out of reach for most the fair 's guests , but that has n't kept them from kicking off their shoes in an old sailing tradition and getting a closer look at the vessels like the 2b . nearly 28 meters -lrb- 92 feet -rrb- long , the ship offers the best of everything according andreas schmidt , the vice-president of drettmann group , which makes the 160-ton yacht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2b 's living room offers the comforts of home " whether its material from jaap or motors from man , we buy all the materials you can see here in europe , " he said , adding that the yacht has to set itself apart to justify its price of about 1 million euros .
" the future owner can choose everything from the motor to the silverware . " while sales for luxury yachts , equipped like the 2b with walk-in closets , a television in every room and even the possibility of an elevator or sauna , have n't experienced much of a drop as potential buyers tend to be wealthy enough to weather the recession , sales of mid-class vessels have been harder hit , schmidt said . drop in sales expected for 2009 sales generated by the yacht and water sports industry , but excluding superyachts , are expected to have dropped in 2008 by just under two percent to 1.84 billion euros compared to the previous year , according to the statistics from the german federal association of the water sports industry -lrb- bvww -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry-wide forecasts for 2009 predict a decline in sales the organization 's managing director , juergen tracht , anticipated that 2009 would also see a fall in sales , " which , if the rosier view is adopted , will be limited to single digits , " he said in a statement . sales of heating , refrigeration , cooking and sanitary facilities as well as multimedia systems are also gaining in importance as boat owners make investments in their current vessels rather than buying new ships , according to the bvww . ship shape for the future ? boat trade fair head goetz-ulf jungmichel said the industry as a whole could be passing through the final waves of its stormy seas . " our clientele has certainly become more cautious , " he said .
" but optimism is returning . " schmidt is among the more optimistic exhibitors at the trade fair , which this year saw a drop in floor-space rental and exhibiting companies . " the people who lost a lot of money will be the first to make it back , " he said .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .
one elderly man , who now lives in northern germany , told the afp that he believed his grandmother was among the dead . " i hope she will finally get a decent burial , and that it will be in marienburg , her home town , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .
international but not universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc was founded in 2002 operating under the auspices of the united nations , the icc was established by the statute of rome in 1998 , an international agreement that has been signed by 108 countries , excluding , among others , the united states , china and russia .
since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .
the court has a total of 17 judges and is presided over by canadian judge philippe kirsch . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .
international but not universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc was founded in 2002 operating under the auspices of the united nations , the icc was established by the statute of rome in 1998 , an international agreement that has been signed by 108 countries , excluding , among others , the united states , china and russia .
since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .
the court has a total of 17 judges and is presided over by canadian judge philippe kirsch . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications .

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

spain suffered the highest death toll . four children were killed when the roof of a sports hall collapsed in the town of sant boi de llobregat near barcelona on saturday .
two adult trainers and 13 children were injured . radio reports said about 30 people were in the indoor arena when the incident happened , seeking shelter from the storm . eight other deaths friday in spain included : a traffic officer killed by a falling tree ; a 52-year-old woman crushed in central barcelona when a wall collapsed on her ; and a fishermen who died during a rescue operation .

the hair decree , as it is called , comes into force on ash wednesday , feb .
25 .
some 2,500 villagers have applied to take part in the next staging of the play from may to october 2010 , according to its artistic director , christian stueckl .
" that is 300 more than we had the last time the play was performed in 2000 , " he told a press conference in munich , outlining details of his third term in charge of the production .
the passion play has been performed every decade since 1634 by the inhabitants of the village of oberammergau in the southern german state of bavaria .
its origin dates back to the thirty years war when the village was decimated by the bubonic plague .
the surviving population promised god that if he saved them they would commemorate it by staging a dramatic representation of christ 's suffering , death and resurrection every ten years .
the only time the play was not performed was during world war ii .
local actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2010 play will be the third one directed by christian stueckl the entire cast consists of villagers who live permanently in oberammergau , which has a population of 5,000 .
they must also be amateurs and people of high moral and ethical principles .
a requirement restricting the roles to christians was dropped in 2000 , when young muslims living in the predominantly catholic village were allowed to appear in the play for the first time .
stueckl altered the text of the 2000 version to remove passages that in the past offended jewish groups with their depiction of jews as christ-killers , giving the play an anti-semitic slant .
the artistic director also plans to change the text for the new season , placing less emphasis on the " revolutionary aspect " of jesus in favor of showing the " consequential way that christ lived his life , right up to his crucifixion . "
the oberammergau passion play is performed in german and runs for five-and-a-half hours , with a three-hour break .
in the past it was staged during the morning and afternoon .
controversial change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing the play schedule required a village referendum for the first time , the 2010 version will be performed in the afternoon and evening , a change which caused a lot of controversy , according to the play 's spokesman frederik mayet .
" the issue was put to a referendum , in which 4,000 people took part , " mayet said .
" sixty-five per cent were in favor on the new schedule . "
the final cast selection is due to be made on april 18 , with rehearsals scheduled to begin in october .
stueckl has also designed a new setting for the production , but will continue to use the colorful costumes designed and made by villagers for the 2000 staging .
more than half-a-million visitors , many from abroad , are expected to descend on the picturesque alpine village for the 100 performances , paying between 49.5 euros -lrb- $ 65 -rrb- and 165 euros -lrb- $ 214 -rrb- for tickets .
passion plays have been staged since the 12th century and often give a detailed portrayal of christ 's physical suffering .
many of them include explicit dramatizations of the beating and execution of christ . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .

in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .
one elderly man , who now lives in northern germany , told the afp that he believed his grandmother was among the dead . " i hope she will finally get a decent burial , and that it will be in marienburg , her home town , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .
one elderly man , who now lives in northern germany , told the afp that he believed his grandmother was among the dead . " i hope she will finally get a decent burial , and that it will be in marienburg , her home town , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .
international but not universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc was founded in 2002 operating under the auspices of the united nations , the icc was established by the statute of rome in 1998 , an international agreement that has been signed by 108 countries , excluding , among others , the united states , china and russia .
since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .
one elderly man , who now lives in northern germany , told the afp that he believed his grandmother was among the dead . " i hope she will finally get a decent burial , and that it will be in marienburg , her home town , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .
international but not universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc was founded in 2002 operating under the auspices of the united nations , the icc was established by the statute of rome in 1998 , an international agreement that has been signed by 108 countries , excluding , among others , the united states , china and russia .
since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .
the court has a total of 17 judges and is presided over by canadian judge philippe kirsch . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .
international but not universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc was founded in 2002 operating under the auspices of the united nations , the icc was established by the statute of rome in 1998 , an international agreement that has been signed by 108 countries , excluding , among others , the united states , china and russia .
since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

bilateral trade and investment , development cooperation and cultural initiatives between bangladesh and germany will top the agenda for official talks , scheduled for january 28 .
trade between the two countries is increasing with germany now the second biggest export destination for bangladesh after the united states .
although ready-made clothing make up the bulk of bangladesh 's exports , the south asian nation is also hoping to expand trade with germany in other sectors .
dhaka received a significant number of orders for shipbuilding from germany , which imports textile machinery , chemicals and solutions for green energy among others to bangladesh .
trade between the two countries increased by 16 percent in the first half of 2008 .
bilateral trade volume amounted to $ 2 billion in 2007 , according to the german embassy in dhaka .
new opportunities in education silberberg , who was assigned as a junior officer of the german foreign ministry in dhaka in the early 1980s , visits bangladesh at a time when a newly elected government of prime minister sheikh hasina wazed has taken office , ending two years of rule by a military backed interim administration .
bangladesh 's new government wants stronger cooperation with its development partners .
earlier this week , german and bangladeshi education experts meeting in dhaka called for further cooperation with colleges in germany to improve cooperation in education and scientific research .
" carrying out fundamental and innovative research in a number of areas between the two nations would help us keep pace with present global order , " said professor nazrul islam , chairman of the university grants commission -lrb- ugc -rrb- , which regulates the allocation of funds for bangladesh 's public universities .
islam , a geography professor , identified environment , genetic engineering , bio-technology and molecular science as fields where scholars from the two countries could take up joint research initiatives .
senior professors from a number of public and private universities who attended the meeting , said the recent interest shown by german universities in their bangladeshi counterparts presented opportunities for cooperation .
the meeting in dhaka was jointly organized by germany 's hamburg university and the bangladesh development forum .
hamburg university representative professor hans peter muehlbach said the institution was keen to work with bangladeshi researchers .
" we have plans to set up a research unit in bangladesh to create opportunities for experts as well as students sharing our technologies , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hair decree , as it is called , comes into force on ash wednesday , feb .
25 .
some 2,500 villagers have applied to take part in the next staging of the play from may to october 2010 , according to its artistic director , christian stueckl .
" that is 300 more than we had the last time the play was performed in 2000 , " he told a press conference in munich , outlining details of his third term in charge of the production .
the passion play has been performed every decade since 1634 by the inhabitants of the village of oberammergau in the southern german state of bavaria .
its origin dates back to the thirty years war when the village was decimated by the bubonic plague .
the surviving population promised god that if he saved them they would commemorate it by staging a dramatic representation of christ 's suffering , death and resurrection every ten years .
the only time the play was not performed was during world war ii .
local actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2010 play will be the third one directed by christian stueckl the entire cast consists of villagers who live permanently in oberammergau , which has a population of 5,000 .
they must also be amateurs and people of high moral and ethical principles .
a requirement restricting the roles to christians was dropped in 2000 , when young muslims living in the predominantly catholic village were allowed to appear in the play for the first time .
stueckl altered the text of the 2000 version to remove passages that in the past offended jewish groups with their depiction of jews as christ-killers , giving the play an anti-semitic slant .
the artistic director also plans to change the text for the new season , placing less emphasis on the " revolutionary aspect " of jesus in favor of showing the " consequential way that christ lived his life , right up to his crucifixion . "
the oberammergau passion play is performed in german and runs for five-and-a-half hours , with a three-hour break .
in the past it was staged during the morning and afternoon .
controversial change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing the play schedule required a village referendum for the first time , the 2010 version will be performed in the afternoon and evening , a change which caused a lot of controversy , according to the play 's spokesman frederik mayet .
" the issue was put to a referendum , in which 4,000 people took part , " mayet said .
" sixty-five per cent were in favor on the new schedule . "
the final cast selection is due to be made on april 18 , with rehearsals scheduled to begin in october .
stueckl has also designed a new setting for the production , but will continue to use the colorful costumes designed and made by villagers for the 2000 staging .
more than half-a-million visitors , many from abroad , are expected to descend on the picturesque alpine village for the 100 performances , paying between 49.5 euros -lrb- $ 65 -rrb- and 165 euros -lrb- $ 214 -rrb- for tickets .
passion plays have been staged since the 12th century and often give a detailed portrayal of christ 's physical suffering .
many of them include explicit dramatizations of the beating and execution of christ . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews . " traditionalist catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vatical two went too far for traditionalist catholics besides lifting the excommunication of williamson , the pope on saturday rehabilitated three other society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- bishops who broke with rome over church reforms introduced in the 1960s through the second vatican council . in 1988 the group leader , archbishop marcel lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops in a move branded as schismatic by the vatican .
it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications . " -lrb- this act -rrb- has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree , " he said . but criticism was loud from many corners , even outside of europe . " for any catholic clergy to embrace the anti-semitic holocaust denier is obscene , " said abe foxman , director of the anti-defamation league in the united states . " it would be an insult to catholic-jewish relations and the memory of the millions of jews who perished because they were jews .

historians believe the victims were german residents of the town . the remains of an estimated 1,800 world war ii war victims have been unearthed after construction workers laying the foundations for a hotel discovered a mass grave in malbork near the northern coast of poland last october .
malbork , known previously as marienburg , had been part of the german reich 's former eastern territories , which became part of poland after the war .
today the town 's main tourist attraction is a castle built by the teutonic knights in the 13th century .
since the site had then been a part of germany , polish authorities suspect that the remains belong to ethnic german residents who might have been killed by the advancing soviet army in the final days of the war .
in march 1945 malbork was the scene of heavy combat between adolf hitler 's retreating forces and soviet soldiers entering the town .
victims included children " we are dealing with a mass grave of civilians , probably of german origin .
the presence of children ... suggests they were civilians , " zbigniew sawicki , a polish archaeologist supervising the exhumation , told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malbork is now a tourist attraction for its imposing castle " it is very puzzling that no personal belongings have been found among the remains ...
we have few clues as to how these people died , though there is a high probability they were war victims , " sawicki added .
starvation and exposure investigators believe that many of the victims perished from air raids towards the end of the war and some may have even been executed . around thirty skulls were found with bullet holes , but the likely cause of death for most victims was from starvation and exposure .
the severe winter weather has now hindered the exhumation process .
" these people were buried in an appalling and inhuman manner , " piotr szwedowski , a malbork city official , told the afp news agency .
" it was a serious shock to us ...
we are trying to exhume the remains in the most humane way possible and to ensure them a respectable burial , " he added .
state prosecutors said that poland 's institute of national remembrance would conduct research into the findings .
szwedowski suspects that the massacre took place when most german civilians had already fled the small town , which had some 30,000 residents .
rainer zacharias , a german historian from malbork , wrote a book about the war period and said that as many as 3,000 residents had defied army evacuation orders and the fate of 1,840 of them was unknown . that close to that number of bodies have been exhumed suggests that the victims were ethnic germans .
the discovery has raised hopes among the descendents of former residents .

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .
international but not universal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icc was founded in 2002 operating under the auspices of the united nations , the icc was established by the statute of rome in 1998 , an international agreement that has been signed by 108 countries , excluding , among others , the united states , china and russia .
since it began operating in 2002 , the icc has investigated war crimes and crimes against humanity in the democratic republic of congo , uganda , the central african republic and darfur .
the court has a total of 17 judges and is presided over by canadian judge philippe kirsch . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies !

24 , of a traditionalist bishop who denies the holocaust threatens to harm catholic-jewish relations and foment anti-semitism , jewish leaders warn . pope benedict xvi saturday revoked the 1988 excommunication of four clerics who lead a breakaway ultra-traditionalist catholic group , the vatican announced on saturday . among them is british-born richard williamson , who has made a number of statements saying he does not accept the full extent of the nazi holocaust of jews accepted by mainstream historians . last wednesday , he told swedish television he did not believe there were nazi gas chamgers and that only 300,000 jews died in concentration camps , instead of six million . " there was not one jew killed by the gas chambers .
it was all lies , lies , lies ! " he said . german prosecutors have launched a probe against williamson on suspicion of inciting racial hatred by the comments . before the excommunications were lifted , rome 's chief rabbi said williamson 's rehabilitation would open a " deep wound . " the crif umbrella group of french jewish organizations called him " a despicable liar whose only goal is to revive the centuries-old hate against jews .

it led to the excommunication of lefevbre and his four bishops . lefebvre died in 1991 without reconciling with the vatican , but since his 2005 election as pope , benedict has attempted to draw the group back into the church , including easing restrictions on celebrating the old latin mass , one of the traditions held sacred by sspx members . the latin mass includes a good friday prayer for the conversion of jews to christianity . sspx which claims about 1 million followers worldwide , many of them in france , has criticized several moves in the roman catholic church that stem from the second vatican council , including reconciliation with followers of judaism and and calls for cooperation with other christian denominations . vatican defends move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionalist groups are pleased about now being able to celebrate the old-style latin mass vatican chief spokesman father federico lombardi said williamson 's comments were " completely extraneous " to the lifting of the excommunications .

26 , in the first-ever trial at the world 's permanent international war crimes tribunal in the hague . icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , from argentina , and prosecutor fatou bensouda , from gambia , accuse lubanga , 48 , of recruiting child soldiers during the brutal congolese 1998-2003 civil war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icc chief prosecutor luis moreno-ocampo in limiting its charges only to those of child soldier recruitment , the prosecution defied pressure from human rights groups and victims , who wanted to prosecute lubanga also for other war crimes .
bensouda , 47 , an attorney who previously worked for the rwanda tribunal , had feared that expanding the number of charges would substantially slow down the trial .
she also felt that most of the evidence against lubanga related to the charges of recruiting children for conflict .
lubanga , the former leader of the union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- and his militia allegedly trained hundreds of children and subsequently forced them to fight .
the prosecution claims lubanga deliberately choose children below the age of 15 , because they would follow orders more easily and kill on demand .
lubanga , an ethnic hema , is also known for fighting a bloody war with the lendu tribe in the northeastern congolese province of ituri in 2002 and 2003 .
this war resulted in tens of thousands of deaths .
lubanga has always claimed he had no control over upc militias , because , he said , he was a politician and not a militia leader .
the question of evidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial will shed light on lubanga 's use of child soldiers in congo lubanga was arrested in the congolese capital kinshasa in 2005 .
his trial was originally due to begin in june 2008 but was postponed on june 16 after the judges found the prosecution had withheld more then 200 documents that could be used to prepare lubanga 's defense .
withholding the documents would prevent the congolese militia leader from receiving a fair trial , the court said .
the particular evidence was classified information , retrieved through ways that , the prosecution said , could not be revealed for diplomatic and security reasons .
after months of negotiations , the material has now been given to the court as well as to lubanga 's defense team .
during preliminary hearings , the icc , chaired by british judge sir adrian fulford , 56 , determined there were " substantial reasons " to assume lubanga was responsible for recruiting child soldiers .

while talking about an elderly spanish neighbour of co-presenter andy davies , ross joked he should " give her one last night before the grave " .
the comment has increased media scrutiny on the star , appearing in several sunday newspapers .
the bbc did not receive any complaints over the incident on saturday .
during the exchange , davies mentioned an elderly woman who kept kissing him while he was carrying out diy at his spanish home when ross said : " i think you should just , for charity , give her one last night .
one last night before the grave . "
the bbc said there was no link to any specific individual and that the joke was part of a light-hearted conversation .
a spokesman said : " regular listeners will be familiar with jonathan 's irreverence and innuendo .
absolutely no offence to any individual was intended and , if the media was n't hell bent on stirring up controversy , i 'm sure none would be taken jonathan ross " this light-hearted exchange contained no offensive language , named no individuals and there was clearly no intention to offend anyone .
" nothing broadcast by the bbc was linked to a specific individual or would allow the public to link these comments to an individual . "
' comedic purposes ' ross told the news of the world that " absolutely no offence to any individual was intended " .
he said : " it was a spontaneous , light-hearted remark made in response to an anecdote set in spain , where no-one was named or ever likely to hear the broadcast .
" as far as i was concerned , the story may even have been apocryphal or exaggerated for comedic purposes , as is common practice on radio and comedy shows around the country .
" absolutely no offence to any individual was intended and , if the media was n't hell bent on stirring up controversy , i 'm sure none would be taken . "
more than 5 million viewers tuned into watch ross 's tv return davies issued a statement denying that the joke in the show referred to a real individual and that the story was " poetic licence based on the warm and affectionate behaviour experienced in spanish village life " .
" i did not identify an individual because there is n't one , " he added .
conservative mp david davies called for ross to be replaced .
" on radio 2 you do n't expect x-rated references to sex - and especially sex with an 80-year-old - during the day , " he said .
" he should have gone ages ago .
there 's no way this man should be on the air .
he needs to be replaced now .
" it 's obscene , especially given the amount of money ross is being paid .
it could also be highly offensive to this woman if she 's a real person . "
more than five million viewers tuned in to watch ross 's return to television on friday , during which he interviewed actor tom cruise .
he was returning after a 12-week suspension for his part in a series of lewd phone messages to fawlty towers actor andrew sachs .

the comment has increased media scrutiny on the star , appearing in several sunday newspapers .
the bbc did not receive any complaints over the incident on saturday .
during the exchange , davies mentioned an elderly woman who kept kissing him while he was carrying out diy at his spanish home when ross said : " i think you should just , for charity , give her one last night .
one last night before the grave . "
the bbc said there was no link to any specific individual and that the joke was part of a light-hearted conversation .
a spokesman said : " regular listeners will be familiar with jonathan 's irreverence and innuendo .
absolutely no offence to any individual was intended and , if the media was n't hell bent on stirring up controversy , i 'm sure none would be taken jonathan ross " this light-hearted exchange contained no offensive language , named no individuals and there was clearly no intention to offend anyone .
" nothing broadcast by the bbc was linked to a specific individual or would allow the public to link these comments to an individual . "
' comedic purposes ' ross told the news of the world that " absolutely no offence to any individual was intended " .
he said : " it was a spontaneous , light-hearted remark made in response to an anecdote set in spain , where no-one was named or ever likely to hear the broadcast .
" as far as i was concerned , the story may even have been apocryphal or exaggerated for comedic purposes , as is common practice on radio and comedy shows around the country .
" absolutely no offence to any individual was intended and , if the media was n't hell bent on stirring up controversy , i 'm sure none would be taken . "
more than 5 million viewers tuned into watch ross 's tv return davies issued a statement denying that the joke in the show referred to a real individual and that the story was " poetic licence based on the warm and affectionate behaviour experienced in spanish village life " .
" i did not identify an individual because there is n't one , " he added .
conservative mp david davies called for ross to be replaced .
" on radio 2 you do n't expect x-rated references to sex - and especially sex with an 80-year-old - during the day , " he said .
" he should have gone ages ago .
there 's no way this man should be on the air .
he needs to be replaced now .
" it 's obscene , especially given the amount of money ross is being paid .
it could also be highly offensive to this woman if she 's a real person . "
more than five million viewers tuned in to watch ross 's return to television on friday , during which he interviewed actor tom cruise .
he was returning after a 12-week suspension for his part in a series of lewd phone messages to fawlty towers actor andrew sachs .

thousands of people face losing their savings after the society was placed into administration in november .
in an open letter read out at services on sunday , rev dr donald patton urged presbyterians to sign a petition urging gordon brown to intervene .
dr patton said the prime minister 's decision to guarantee the banking system had triggered the crisis .
" well it was the action that he took that triggered this problem for the mutual society which was going along nicely , " he said .
" no-one foresaw this problem .
it has thrown a lot of people who are constituents of politicians here , who are british citizens , into chaos , caused great anxiety to them and caused great problems . "
he called on his church to hold together through " stormy times " .
a week ago , pms administrator arthur boyd wrote to 9,500 investors recommending that they accept a proposal which , he said , would mean they get some money back .
this would lead to what mr boyd called an " orderly run down " of the business , over time .
if this plan is to go ahead , more than 50 % of investors must vote to back it by the deadline of noon on 30 january .

" well it was the action that he took that triggered this problem for the mutual society which was going along nicely , " he said .
" no-one foresaw this problem .
it has thrown a lot of people who are constituents of politicians here , who are british citizens , into chaos , caused great anxiety to them and caused great problems . "
he called on his church to hold together through " stormy times " .
a week ago , pms administrator arthur boyd wrote to 9,500 investors recommending that they accept a proposal which , he said , would mean they get some money back .
this would lead to what mr boyd called an " orderly run down " of the business , over time .
if this plan is to go ahead , more than 50 % of investors must vote to back it by the deadline of noon on 30 january .
