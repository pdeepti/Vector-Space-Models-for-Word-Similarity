but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .
" it 's impossible in this situation . " but others tried to draw some initial lessons from the tragic incident . " we need to ask what we can do in a preventive sense - what schools can do to be prepared and react correctly in critical moments , " family minister ursula von der leyen told reporters . " but we also need to ask : what are the patterns ? " she added .
" what triggers someone to run amok ? " recognition problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all of germany mourned for the victims the winnenden rampage is the latest in a string of school shootings in germany in the last decade . in 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western german town of emsdetten , wounding at least 11 people before committing suicide .
in april 2002 , a former student at a high school in the eastern city of erfurt killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself . psychologists say such acts of extreme , seemingly random violence result from a distorted relationship between the self and the outside world . " the young perpetrator ca n't find a way of getting recognition in reality , " karoline roshdi , a psychologist at the darmstadt university , told dw-tv .
" so they use violent fantasies to cope with this imbalanced situation .
they comb the media for examples of similar perpetrators to emulate and thereby gain recognition . " roshdi said the key to avoiding other shooting incidents in the future was recognizing the warning signs , including suicide threats and social isolation . " there are risk indicators , and we need to communicate if there 's a pupil at risk , " roshdi said .
" sometimes , an art teacher , for example , might notice one warning sign , and fellow students another one .
they need to be brought together . " too little supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts called for a number of measures they say would protect children in the immediate aftermath of the shootings , psychologists were brought in from throughout germany to help those affected cope with the trauma of what had happened . but questions were also raised as to whether the number of trained experts in german schools was adequate to prevent a repeat of wednesday 's tragic events . " in individual cases , some new posts -lsb- for school psychologists -rsb- have been created , but there are still far too few , " ap news agency reported . the agency said germany has only one psychologist per 12,000 students - compared to around one for every 770 students in denmark .
the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where winnenden is located , ranks near the bottom in germany . others questioned whether german laws concerning firearms , which were beefed up after the 2002 erfurt shootings , needed to be tightened even further .
it is thought that tim k. may have used a registered firearm belonging to his father to carry out the massacre . still others said the state should impose tighter restrictions on ultra-violent video games some think encourage psychologically unstable youngsters to act out their fantasies in real life . jc / sms / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" tourism is one of , if not the most important industry for the perennially cash-strapped german capital , and the number of annual visitors has more than doubled since the early 1990s . in tough economic times , luxuries such as vacations are often the first to face the axe as consumers rein in spending . but berlin tourism officials remain optimistic their city will defy the trend . taenzler said berlin has advantages that should continue to appeal to potential visitors . " poor but cheap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city has profited from budget airlines berlin 's tourist boom has been fueled by two major european budget airlines that allow weekend party-goers , for example , to pop over and enjoy the city 's internationally famous club scene . and it 's cheap to stay in as well as fly to berlin . " we may take a cut , but berlin is very competitive with cities like paris or london in terms of what you get for your money , " taenzler said .
" that goes from the price of a cup of cappuccino up to tickets for cultural events . " hotel prices are roughly half of what they are in other european capitals , and in recent years berlin has seen a virtual explosion in hostels , mostly located in the hip neighborhoods of mitte , prenzlauer berg and kreuzberg . " at the moment , we have n't noticed any effects from the financial crisis , " simone schueler , who operates the pegasus hostel in berlin 's friedrichshain district , told deutsche welle .
" we have to pay attention to our prices , but that 's because the hostel market itself has grown so much . " " poor but cultural " bildunterschrift : berlin has theaters of all sizes in nearly every district berlin also benefits from the number of cultural events on offer . recurrent highlights such as the berlin film festival attract visitors with specific interests at certain times of year , while others are drawn generally by the theater scene , the music performances or the nightlife . " another difference to london and paris is that ordinary people are usually able to get tickets for things they want to see , " taenzler said . it also probably does n't hurt that berlin 's bars are allowed to stay open round the clock . " i do n't think i 'm exaggerating when i say that , even in new york , berlin is known as absolutely the place to be right now , " taenzler said . " poor but historic " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city expects lots of visitors commemorating history this year ironically , the economic crisis may have come at the right time for berlin since the city expects lots of visitors to mark the 20th anniversary of one of the last century 's key events - the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 . that date has not escaped the notice of city tourism officials , who are doing their best to market the final days of communism to potential travelers . " the interest in the anniversary , especially abroad , has been very great , " taenzler said .
" and we 're already inviting journalists to the city in the hope that visitors will be inspired by their reports and follow them . " the tourist office has rolled out a bus , painted on the outside to look like the berlin wall , on the streets of amsterdam to encourage nostalgic dutch to take a sojourn to the german capital . none of these efforts by berlin 's promoters is likely to change the fact that the german capital remains relatively impecunious compared with other major european counterparts . but berlin officials are hoping that the relative lack of money floating around in what used to be a western island in the warsaw pact will turn out to be an advantage in times where many people have to budget their holidays more carefully . author : jefferson chase editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .
" it 's impossible in this situation . " but others tried to draw some initial lessons from the tragic incident . " we need to ask what we can do in a preventive sense - what schools can do to be prepared and react correctly in critical moments , " family minister ursula von der leyen told reporters . " but we also need to ask : what are the patterns ? " she added .
" what triggers someone to run amok ? " recognition problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all of germany mourned for the victims the winnenden rampage is the latest in a string of school shootings in germany in the last decade . in 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western german town of emsdetten , wounding at least 11 people before committing suicide .
in april 2002 , a former student at a high school in the eastern city of erfurt killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself . psychologists say such acts of extreme , seemingly random violence result from a distorted relationship between the self and the outside world . " the young perpetrator ca n't find a way of getting recognition in reality , " karoline roshdi , a psychologist at the darmstadt university , told dw-tv .
" so they use violent fantasies to cope with this imbalanced situation .
they comb the media for examples of similar perpetrators to emulate and thereby gain recognition . " roshdi said the key to avoiding other shooting incidents in the future was recognizing the warning signs , including suicide threats and social isolation . " there are risk indicators , and we need to communicate if there 's a pupil at risk , " roshdi said .
" sometimes , an art teacher , for example , might notice one warning sign , and fellow students another one .
they need to be brought together . " too little supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts called for a number of measures they say would protect children in the immediate aftermath of the shootings , psychologists were brought in from throughout germany to help those affected cope with the trauma of what had happened . but questions were also raised as to whether the number of trained experts in german schools was adequate to prevent a repeat of wednesday 's tragic events . " in individual cases , some new posts -lsb- for school psychologists -rsb- have been created , but there are still far too few , " ap news agency reported . the agency said germany has only one psychologist per 12,000 students - compared to around one for every 770 students in denmark .
the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where winnenden is located , ranks near the bottom in germany . others questioned whether german laws concerning firearms , which were beefed up after the 2002 erfurt shootings , needed to be tightened even further .
it is thought that tim k. may have used a registered firearm belonging to his father to carry out the massacre . still others said the state should impose tighter restrictions on ultra-violent video games some think encourage psychologically unstable youngsters to act out their fantasies in real life . jc / sms / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have never had this kind of a recession , taking place at the same time in all countries of the world , since world war ii , " merkel said in an interview with the mass-market daily bild published wednesday , march 11 .
" but i 'm certain that germany is better equipped than most countries to master this crisis . " merkel pointed out that , at the end of 2008 , germany enjoyed its highest level of employment in decades and its first balanced national budget in years . this , merkel argued , meant that the country would not only be able to cope with the current economic difficulties but also use the opportunity to make improvements .

he described the find as a " small sensation , " comparing it to fragments of clothing once worn by oetzi , an alpine ice man whose 5,000-year-old mummified body was discovered in a melting glacier in the nearby alps in 1991 .
the european size 36 sandal , made of woven wood , was discovered in silt deposits on the site of an early settlement of lake dwellings built on stilts at the water 's edge .
schmalzl said european union funds would be used to research and preserve the areas where lake dwellings existed , on lake constance and lake zurich in neighboring switzerland .
the settlements were inhabited between the 4th and 1st century bc .
the remains , preserved for thousands of years by layers of silt , are under threat as a result of climate change , harbor construction and passing ships .
" this underwater archive is in danger , " schmalzl said .
the team working on protecting the ancient dwellings are ultimately hoping for unesco designation as a world heritage site .
they say it will help them to better protect the area and keep it closed to tourists .

can the german capital draw similar numbers this year as the global economic crisis hammers tourism worldwide ? as the international tourism fair itb opens in berlin on wednesday , march 11 , the city announced another record-setting performance in precisely that area .
the metropolis attracted 7.9 million visitors in 2008 - a gain of more than 4 percent over 2007 and the fifth year in a row a new record has been set . the mood in the tourism industry is generally somber , with german travel agents reporting plunging demand with the outbreak of the global economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes visitors will keep shelling out to see the sights " at the moment , it 's difficult , even impossible to predict because the market is indifferent , " christian taenzler , spokeman for the berlin tourism company , told deutsche welle .
" business travel is sluggish with trips being cancelled or shortened .
but in the leisure area , the hotels are well booked . " tourism is one of , if not the most important industry for the perennially cash-strapped german capital , and the number of annual visitors has more than doubled since the early 1990s . in tough economic times , luxuries such as vacations are often the first to face the axe as consumers rein in spending . but berlin tourism officials remain optimistic their city will defy the trend . taenzler said berlin has advantages that should continue to appeal to potential visitors . " poor but cheap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city has profited from budget airlines berlin 's tourist boom has been fueled by two major european budget airlines that allow weekend party-goers , for example , to pop over and enjoy the city 's internationally famous club scene . and it 's cheap to stay in as well as fly to berlin . " we may take a cut , but berlin is very competitive with cities like paris or london in terms of what you get for your money , " taenzler said .
" that goes from the price of a cup of cappuccino up to tickets for cultural events . " hotel prices are roughly half of what they are in other european capitals , and in recent years berlin has seen a virtual explosion in hostels , mostly located in the hip neighborhoods of mitte , prenzlauer berg and kreuzberg . " at the moment , we have n't noticed any effects from the financial crisis , " simone schueler , who operates the pegasus hostel in berlin 's friedrichshain district , told deutsche welle .
" we have to pay attention to our prices , but that 's because the hostel market itself has grown so much . " " poor but cultural " bildunterschrift : berlin has theaters of all sizes in nearly every district berlin also benefits from the number of cultural events on offer . recurrent highlights such as the berlin film festival attract visitors with specific interests at certain times of year , while others are drawn generally by the theater scene , the music performances or the nightlife . " another difference to london and paris is that ordinary people are usually able to get tickets for things they want to see , " taenzler said . it also probably does n't hurt that berlin 's bars are allowed to stay open round the clock . " i do n't think i 'm exaggerating when i say that , even in new york , berlin is known as absolutely the place to be right now , " taenzler said . " poor but historic " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city expects lots of visitors commemorating history this year ironically , the economic crisis may have come at the right time for berlin since the city expects lots of visitors to mark the 20th anniversary of one of the last century 's key events - the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 . that date has not escaped the notice of city tourism officials , who are doing their best to market the final days of communism to potential travelers . " the interest in the anniversary , especially abroad , has been very great , " taenzler said .
" and we 're already inviting journalists to the city in the hope that visitors will be inspired by their reports and follow them . " the tourist office has rolled out a bus , painted on the outside to look like the berlin wall , on the streets of amsterdam to encourage nostalgic dutch to take a sojourn to the german capital . none of these efforts by berlin 's promoters is likely to change the fact that the german capital remains relatively impecunious compared with other major european counterparts . but berlin officials are hoping that the relative lack of money floating around in what used to be a western island in the warsaw pact will turn out to be an advantage in times where many people have to budget their holidays more carefully . author : jefferson chase editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he described the find as a " small sensation , " comparing it to fragments of clothing once worn by oetzi , an alpine ice man whose 5,000-year-old mummified body was discovered in a melting glacier in the nearby alps in 1991 .
the european size 36 sandal , made of woven wood , was discovered in silt deposits on the site of an early settlement of lake dwellings built on stilts at the water 's edge .
schmalzl said european union funds would be used to research and preserve the areas where lake dwellings existed , on lake constance and lake zurich in neighboring switzerland .
the settlements were inhabited between the 4th and 1st century bc .
the remains , preserved for thousands of years by layers of silt , are under threat as a result of climate change , harbor construction and passing ships .

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west . " however , two recent public-opinion polls show that a substantial majority of the french favors the decision . sms / jc / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 11.03.2009 france to rejoin nato military command after 43 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will once again begin to take full part in nato decision making french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed on wednesday that france will be rejoining nato 's military command structure , saying the move was in the best security interests of his country and of europe . sarkozy said on wednesday , march 11 , that france would return to the nato military command and seek a larger role as a full partner of the united states and its other atlantic allies . " nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .

the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west . " however , two recent public-opinion polls show that a substantial majority of the french favors the decision . sms / jc / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .
" it 's impossible in this situation . " but others tried to draw some initial lessons from the tragic incident . " we need to ask what we can do in a preventive sense - what schools can do to be prepared and react correctly in critical moments , " family minister ursula von der leyen told reporters . " but we also need to ask : what are the patterns ? " she added .
" what triggers someone to run amok ? " recognition problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all of germany mourned for the victims the winnenden rampage is the latest in a string of school shootings in germany in the last decade . in 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western german town of emsdetten , wounding at least 11 people before committing suicide .
in april 2002 , a former student at a high school in the eastern city of erfurt killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself . psychologists say such acts of extreme , seemingly random violence result from a distorted relationship between the self and the outside world . " the young perpetrator ca n't find a way of getting recognition in reality , " karoline roshdi , a psychologist at the darmstadt university , told dw-tv .
" so they use violent fantasies to cope with this imbalanced situation .
they comb the media for examples of similar perpetrators to emulate and thereby gain recognition . " roshdi said the key to avoiding other shooting incidents in the future was recognizing the warning signs , including suicide threats and social isolation . " there are risk indicators , and we need to communicate if there 's a pupil at risk , " roshdi said .
" sometimes , an art teacher , for example , might notice one warning sign , and fellow students another one .
they need to be brought together . " too little supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts called for a number of measures they say would protect children in the immediate aftermath of the shootings , psychologists were brought in from throughout germany to help those affected cope with the trauma of what had happened . but questions were also raised as to whether the number of trained experts in german schools was adequate to prevent a repeat of wednesday 's tragic events . " in individual cases , some new posts -lsb- for school psychologists -rsb- have been created , but there are still far too few , " ap news agency reported . the agency said germany has only one psychologist per 12,000 students - compared to around one for every 770 students in denmark .
the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where winnenden is located , ranks near the bottom in germany . others questioned whether german laws concerning firearms , which were beefed up after the 2002 erfurt shootings , needed to be tightened even further .
it is thought that tim k. may have used a registered firearm belonging to his father to carry out the massacre . still others said the state should impose tighter restrictions on ultra-violent video games some think encourage psychologically unstable youngsters to act out their fantasies in real life . jc / sms / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european size 36 sandal , made of woven wood , was discovered in silt deposits on the site of an early settlement of lake dwellings built on stilts at the water 's edge .
schmalzl said european union funds would be used to research and preserve the areas where lake dwellings existed , on lake constance and lake zurich in neighboring switzerland .
the settlements were inhabited between the 4th and 1st century bc .
the remains , preserved for thousands of years by layers of silt , are under threat as a result of climate change , harbor construction and passing ships .

the team working on protecting the ancient dwellings are ultimately hoping for unesco designation as a world heritage site .

he described the find as a " small sensation , " comparing it to fragments of clothing once worn by oetzi , an alpine ice man whose 5,000-year-old mummified body was discovered in a melting glacier in the nearby alps in 1991 .
the european size 36 sandal , made of woven wood , was discovered in silt deposits on the site of an early settlement of lake dwellings built on stilts at the water 's edge .
schmalzl said european union funds would be used to research and preserve the areas where lake dwellings existed , on lake constance and lake zurich in neighboring switzerland .
the settlements were inhabited between the 4th and 1st century bc .
the remains , preserved for thousands of years by layers of silt , are under threat as a result of climate change , harbor construction and passing ships .
" this underwater archive is in danger , " schmalzl said .
the team working on protecting the ancient dwellings are ultimately hoping for unesco designation as a world heritage site .
they say it will help them to better protect the area and keep it closed to tourists .

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west .

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer .

" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .

" our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west .

he was convicted and sentenced to death , but was then freed by a court that doubted the veracity of some of the evidence .
since the trial , evidence has been found to establish demjanjuk 's ss membership and that he served as a guard in sobibor . in the current attempt to bring him to justice , munich prosecutors applied for the warrant based on a document from bavarian criminal investigators that testified to the authenticity of the ss identity card provided by us officials . " the accused is currently still in the united states , " a court official said in a statement released in munich .
" as soon as he arrives in germany he will be questioned and tried . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some questioned the authenticity of demjanjuk 's id card the united states , which has already stripped demjanjuk of his citizenship , said late wednesday that it would continue to lend support to germany as it prosecutes the ukrainian-born suspect . demjanjuk , a retired auto worker in the us state of ohio , battled us authorities over his citizenship revocation for years , only to lose last year . demjanjuk lived in munich as a refugee shortly after the end of the world war ii before settling in the united states in 1952 .
however , allegations that he worked at the death camp have dogged him since the late 1970s . sms / jc / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .

but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .

he was convicted and sentenced to death , but was then freed by a court that doubted the veracity of some of the evidence .
since the trial , evidence has been found to establish demjanjuk 's ss membership and that he served as a guard in sobibor . in the current attempt to bring him to justice , munich prosecutors applied for the warrant based on a document from bavarian criminal investigators that testified to the authenticity of the ss identity card provided by us officials .

in addition to the presence of foreign troops , the war sparked sectarian violence between sunnis and the iran-backed shiite muslims . biggest refugee group in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , 65,500 residents in germany were classified as refugees it remains unclear exactly how many iraqis have resettled in syria .
the unhcr has said roughly 1.5 million iraqi refugees are there , but the norwegian research institute fafo has claimed the actually number is only one-third of that . since 2003 , the unhcr has resettled thousands of iraqis in 16 countries .
iraqis make up the largest group of the 65,500 people classified as refugees living in germany , statistics show .
substantial number of refugees in germany hail from turkey , iran and afghanistan . asylum applications down germany 's federal office for migration and refugees said iraqis accounted for around one third of asylum applications received since the start of 2009 . still the number of asylum applicants in germany has declined over the past two years , meaning that the country " certainly has the capability " to take in refugees , amnesty international 's julia duchrow told the afp news agency last week . duchrow explained that successful asylum applicants were required to have a clean criminal record and could not have been members of former iraqi president saddam hussein 's baath party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugees in syria wait their turn to be processed by unhcr single mothers , those suffering from post-traumatic stress and people with ties to germany also had a greater chance of having their application for asylum approved , she added . other eu countries participating in the program to accept more iraqi refugees include britain , denmark , finland , the netherlands , norway and sweden . sweden urges eu countries to do more last week a senior swedish official urged other european nations to take in more iraqi refugees , saying that sweden will put the matter on its agenda when it assumes the six month eu presidency in july . in november , the european union agreed to take in 10,000 of the most vulnerable refugees from war-torn iraq .
the united states on the other hand had admitted only 1,200 refugees in 2007 , but has since opened its doors to over 12,000 asylum seekers , following criticism from the eu and international refugee organizations . df / sms / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de human rights groups call on berlin to set up permanent refugee scheme four hundred iraqi refugees are set to land in germany later this month .

" it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " at 9:30 a.m. local time , a 17-year-old identified only as tim k. entered the albertville school in winnenden - a town of 27,600 , near stuttgart in southwestern germany - and began shooting randomly . nine students , aged between15 and 16 , and three teachers died in this initial attack . " i heard two shots and then a scream , " a 15-year-old pupil inside the school told ap news agency .
" at first , i thought it was a joke , but then someone yelled : ' run , run ! " ' police said that two emergency squads were immediately dispatched to the school , but that the gunman had already hijacked a car and fled to the town of wendlingen - around 40 kilometers away . police said the gunman shot dead three bystanders , before taking his own life .
authorities corrected earlier reports saying the teenager was killed by police in a shoot-out . authorities estimated the total death toll to be at least 16 , although initial details about those injured were sketchy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winnenden is located in the state of baden-wuerttemberg in southwestern germany the gunman 's father was a member of a local rifle club , and police who searched the family home found one pistol along with some 100 bullets missing . wednesday 's shooting followed a rampage in the united states on tuesday in which a gunman shot dead 11 people then killed himself in southern alabama . string of school shootings the winnenden incident is the latest in a string of school shootings in germany in recent years . in 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western german town of emsdetten , wounding at least eleven people before committing suicide . in april 2002 , a gunman killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself at a high school in the eastern city erfurt in the worst such incident . german politicians and community leaders were unanimous in condemning the latest shooting spree . ulrich wilhelm , spokesman for the federal government in berlin , told reporters that the winnenden incident was " horrific " but that the police had done all they could . jc / sms / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jung said the afghan government could count on german support during the presidential elections in august .
berlin would send 600 additional troops to help with security during that time , he said .

can the german capital draw similar numbers this year as the global economic crisis hammers tourism worldwide ? as the international tourism fair itb opens in berlin on wednesday , march 11 , the city announced another record-setting performance in precisely that area .
the metropolis attracted 7.9 million visitors in 2008 - a gain of more than 4 percent over 2007 and the fifth year in a row a new record has been set . the mood in the tourism industry is generally somber , with german travel agents reporting plunging demand with the outbreak of the global economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes visitors will keep shelling out to see the sights " at the moment , it 's difficult , even impossible to predict because the market is indifferent , " christian taenzler , spokeman for the berlin tourism company , told deutsche welle .
" business travel is sluggish with trips being cancelled or shortened .

" tourism is one of , if not the most important industry for the perennially cash-strapped german capital , and the number of annual visitors has more than doubled since the early 1990s . in tough economic times , luxuries such as vacations are often the first to face the axe as consumers rein in spending . but berlin tourism officials remain optimistic their city will defy the trend . taenzler said berlin has advantages that should continue to appeal to potential visitors . " poor but cheap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city has profited from budget airlines berlin 's tourist boom has been fueled by two major european budget airlines that allow weekend party-goers , for example , to pop over and enjoy the city 's internationally famous club scene . and it 's cheap to stay in as well as fly to berlin . " we may take a cut , but berlin is very competitive with cities like paris or london in terms of what you get for your money , " taenzler said .
" that goes from the price of a cup of cappuccino up to tickets for cultural events . " hotel prices are roughly half of what they are in other european capitals , and in recent years berlin has seen a virtual explosion in hostels , mostly located in the hip neighborhoods of mitte , prenzlauer berg and kreuzberg . " at the moment , we have n't noticed any effects from the financial crisis , " simone schueler , who operates the pegasus hostel in berlin 's friedrichshain district , told deutsche welle .
" we have to pay attention to our prices , but that 's because the hostel market itself has grown so much . " " poor but cultural " bildunterschrift : berlin has theaters of all sizes in nearly every district berlin also benefits from the number of cultural events on offer . recurrent highlights such as the berlin film festival attract visitors with specific interests at certain times of year , while others are drawn generally by the theater scene , the music performances or the nightlife . " another difference to london and paris is that ordinary people are usually able to get tickets for things they want to see , " taenzler said . it also probably does n't hurt that berlin 's bars are allowed to stay open round the clock . " i do n't think i 'm exaggerating when i say that , even in new york , berlin is known as absolutely the place to be right now , " taenzler said . " poor but historic " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city expects lots of visitors commemorating history this year ironically , the economic crisis may have come at the right time for berlin since the city expects lots of visitors to mark the 20th anniversary of one of the last century 's key events - the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 . that date has not escaped the notice of city tourism officials , who are doing their best to market the final days of communism to potential travelers . " the interest in the anniversary , especially abroad , has been very great , " taenzler said .
" and we 're already inviting journalists to the city in the hope that visitors will be inspired by their reports and follow them . " the tourist office has rolled out a bus , painted on the outside to look like the berlin wall , on the streets of amsterdam to encourage nostalgic dutch to take a sojourn to the german capital . none of these efforts by berlin 's promoters is likely to change the fact that the german capital remains relatively impecunious compared with other major european counterparts . but berlin officials are hoping that the relative lack of money floating around in what used to be a western island in the warsaw pact will turn out to be an advantage in times where many people have to budget their holidays more carefully . author : jefferson chase editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west . " however , two recent public-opinion polls show that a substantial majority of the french favors the decision . sms / jc / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the metropolis attracted 7.9 million visitors in 2008 - a gain of more than 4 percent over 2007 and the fifth year in a row a new record has been set . the mood in the tourism industry is generally somber , with german travel agents reporting plunging demand with the outbreak of the global economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes visitors will keep shelling out to see the sights " at the moment , it 's difficult , even impossible to predict because the market is indifferent , " christian taenzler , spokeman for the berlin tourism company , told deutsche welle .
" business travel is sluggish with trips being cancelled or shortened .
but in the leisure area , the hotels are well booked . " tourism is one of , if not the most important industry for the perennially cash-strapped german capital , and the number of annual visitors has more than doubled since the early 1990s . in tough economic times , luxuries such as vacations are often the first to face the axe as consumers rein in spending . but berlin tourism officials remain optimistic their city will defy the trend . taenzler said berlin has advantages that should continue to appeal to potential visitors . " poor but cheap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city has profited from budget airlines berlin 's tourist boom has been fueled by two major european budget airlines that allow weekend party-goers , for example , to pop over and enjoy the city 's internationally famous club scene . and it 's cheap to stay in as well as fly to berlin . " we may take a cut , but berlin is very competitive with cities like paris or london in terms of what you get for your money , " taenzler said .
" that goes from the price of a cup of cappuccino up to tickets for cultural events . " hotel prices are roughly half of what they are in other european capitals , and in recent years berlin has seen a virtual explosion in hostels , mostly located in the hip neighborhoods of mitte , prenzlauer berg and kreuzberg . " at the moment , we have n't noticed any effects from the financial crisis , " simone schueler , who operates the pegasus hostel in berlin 's friedrichshain district , told deutsche welle .
" we have to pay attention to our prices , but that 's because the hostel market itself has grown so much . " " poor but cultural " bildunterschrift : berlin has theaters of all sizes in nearly every district berlin also benefits from the number of cultural events on offer . recurrent highlights such as the berlin film festival attract visitors with specific interests at certain times of year , while others are drawn generally by the theater scene , the music performances or the nightlife . " another difference to london and paris is that ordinary people are usually able to get tickets for things they want to see , " taenzler said . it also probably does n't hurt that berlin 's bars are allowed to stay open round the clock . " i do n't think i 'm exaggerating when i say that , even in new york , berlin is known as absolutely the place to be right now , " taenzler said . " poor but historic " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city expects lots of visitors commemorating history this year ironically , the economic crisis may have come at the right time for berlin since the city expects lots of visitors to mark the 20th anniversary of one of the last century 's key events - the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 . that date has not escaped the notice of city tourism officials , who are doing their best to market the final days of communism to potential travelers . " the interest in the anniversary , especially abroad , has been very great , " taenzler said .
" and we 're already inviting journalists to the city in the hope that visitors will be inspired by their reports and follow them . " the tourist office has rolled out a bus , painted on the outside to look like the berlin wall , on the streets of amsterdam to encourage nostalgic dutch to take a sojourn to the german capital . none of these efforts by berlin 's promoters is likely to change the fact that the german capital remains relatively impecunious compared with other major european counterparts . but berlin officials are hoping that the relative lack of money floating around in what used to be a western island in the warsaw pact will turn out to be an advantage in times where many people have to budget their holidays more carefully . author : jefferson chase editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but chancellor angela merkel is trying to convince worried germans that the country will be able to weather the storm . germany is experiencing the worst economic crisis in 60 years , said chancellor angela merkel . " we have never had this kind of a recession , taking place at the same time in all countries of the world , since world war ii , " merkel said in an interview with the mass-market daily bild published wednesday , march 11 .
" but i 'm certain that germany is better equipped than most countries to master this crisis . " merkel pointed out that , at the end of 2008 , germany enjoyed its highest level of employment in decades and its first balanced national budget in years . this , merkel argued , meant that the country would not only be able to cope with the current economic difficulties but also use the opportunity to make improvements . " we want to come out of this crisis stronger than we went into it , " merkel said . she also cited prominent examples from german history . " this year , we 're celebrating 60 years of the federal republic of germany and 20 years since the fall of the wall , " merkel said .
" thanks to our social market economy , we managed to rebuild the country after the war and tackle german reunification after 1989 . " clock is ticking for hre merkel also defended plans by finance minister peer steinbrueck to nationalize troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- .
it 's a move that has been criticized by many of the chancellor 's fellow conservatives in her party of christian democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre only has a few weeks to get its finances in order steinbrueck , a member of merkel 's coalition partner the social democrats , has drafted a draft law allowing the nationalization .
it is scheduled to come up for a parliamentary vote later this month . " the excesses of the markets , which triggered the crisis , force us to cross over boundaries and do things which we otherwise would n't , " merkel said . but the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported on wednesday that hre 's time is running out .
the bank 's supervisory board is set to review the books on april 24 and is expected to find a loss of several billion euros . the accounts must be balanced for the bank to prove it has enough equity and stave off nationalization .
various media sources have speculated that the lender may require a capital injection of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- . at the moment , hre is only staying solvent because of some 102 billion euros worth of mainly government-provided guarantees , leading many to believe a government take-over is almost inevitable . but merkel reassured critics that any acts of government intervention will be temporary , " wherever the state has to become a shareholder in a bank , it will pull out again as soon as this is possible , " she said . opel 's future dependent on clarity about gm meanwhile , merkel said the government would not get involved in troubled carmaker opel until the future of its parent company gm had been clarified in the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still hoping for brighter economic skies " we will support companies like opel if our help can ensure a good future for these companies and not only just go up in smoke after a company failed in the market , " merkel told the bild . she said the german government would only help those companies whose " benefit for all people in germany is greater than its damage . " " state aid can only act as a bridge for the problems of the financial crisis , after which companies must be successful in the market under their own power , " merkel said . the german government has been burned in the past by troubled companies - for example , several years ago , when berlin pumped funds into construction group philipp holzmann only to have it declare bankruptcy shortly thereafter . sac / jc / sms send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's defense minister franz josef jung has promised more troops and is optimistic that the security situation is stabilizing . german defense minister franz josef jung said afghanistan was on the right path forward despite continual attacks . " i have the impression that things are going forward well , " said jung on wednesday , march 11 , in kabul .
this was also the case in the afghan capital , where the number of attacks had decreased , he said . jung had previously met with his afghan counterpart abdul rahim wardak as his three-day trip to uzbekistan and afghanistan wrapped up .
jung said the afghan government could count on german support during the presidential elections in august .
berlin would send 600 additional troops to help with security during that time , he said . " germany remains a reliable partner and a true friend of the afghan people and will fulfill its promises , " jung said . jung also met with the head of nato troops in afghanistan , gen. david mckiernan . kunduz stabilizing jung had previously visited the northern afghan city of kunduz .
he said the situation was stabilizing after three german soldiers were killed there last year .

his comments followed statements by us president barack obama and vice president joe biden that the us would consider sitting down with moderate taliban members to seek a way of ending the fighting in afghanistan . but , it would be up to the afghan government in kabul to determine the chances of such talks succeeding , jung said . germany currently has more than 3,500 soldiers deployed in northern afghanistan as part of nato 's international security assistance force .

he was convicted and sentenced to death , but was then freed by a court that doubted the veracity of some of the evidence .
since the trial , evidence has been found to establish demjanjuk 's ss membership and that he served as a guard in sobibor . in the current attempt to bring him to justice , munich prosecutors applied for the warrant based on a document from bavarian criminal investigators that testified to the authenticity of the ss identity card provided by us officials . " the accused is currently still in the united states , " a court official said in a statement released in munich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 11.03.2009 france to rejoin nato military command after 43 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will once again begin to take full part in nato decision making french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed on wednesday that france will be rejoining nato 's military command structure , saying the move was in the best security interests of his country and of europe . sarkozy said on wednesday , march 11 , that france would return to the nato military command and seek a larger role as a full partner of the united states and its other atlantic allies . " nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west . " however , two recent public-opinion polls show that a substantial majority of the french favors the decision . sms / jc / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he described the find as a " small sensation , " comparing it to fragments of clothing once worn by oetzi , an alpine ice man whose 5,000-year-old mummified body was discovered in a melting glacier in the nearby alps in 1991 .
the european size 36 sandal , made of woven wood , was discovered in silt deposits on the site of an early settlement of lake dwellings built on stilts at the water 's edge .
schmalzl said european union funds would be used to research and preserve the areas where lake dwellings existed , on lake constance and lake zurich in neighboring switzerland .
the settlements were inhabited between the 4th and 1st century bc .
the remains , preserved for thousands of years by layers of silt , are under threat as a result of climate change , harbor construction and passing ships .
" this underwater archive is in danger , " schmalzl said .
the team working on protecting the ancient dwellings are ultimately hoping for unesco designation as a world heritage site .
they say it will help them to better protect the area and keep it closed to tourists .

he described the find as a " small sensation , " comparing it to fragments of clothing once worn by oetzi , an alpine ice man whose 5,000-year-old mummified body was discovered in a melting glacier in the nearby alps in 1991 .
the european size 36 sandal , made of woven wood , was discovered in silt deposits on the site of an early settlement of lake dwellings built on stilts at the water 's edge .
schmalzl said european union funds would be used to research and preserve the areas where lake dwellings existed , on lake constance and lake zurich in neighboring switzerland .
the settlements were inhabited between the 4th and 1st century bc .
the remains , preserved for thousands of years by layers of silt , are under threat as a result of climate change , harbor construction and passing ships .
" this underwater archive is in danger , " schmalzl said .
the team working on protecting the ancient dwellings are ultimately hoping for unesco designation as a world heritage site .
they say it will help them to better protect the area and keep it closed to tourists .

he described the find as a " small sensation , " comparing it to fragments of clothing once worn by oetzi , an alpine ice man whose 5,000-year-old mummified body was discovered in a melting glacier in the nearby alps in 1991 .
the european size 36 sandal , made of woven wood , was discovered in silt deposits on the site of an early settlement of lake dwellings built on stilts at the water 's edge .
schmalzl said european union funds would be used to research and preserve the areas where lake dwellings existed , on lake constance and lake zurich in neighboring switzerland .
the settlements were inhabited between the 4th and 1st century bc .
the remains , preserved for thousands of years by layers of silt , are under threat as a result of climate change , harbor construction and passing ships .
" this underwater archive is in danger , " schmalzl said .
the team working on protecting the ancient dwellings are ultimately hoping for unesco designation as a world heritage site .
they say it will help them to better protect the area and keep it closed to tourists .
" we do n't want a hollywood on stilts under water , " schmalzl said . sp / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he described the find as a " small sensation , " comparing it to fragments of clothing once worn by oetzi , an alpine ice man whose 5,000-year-old mummified body was discovered in a melting glacier in the nearby alps in 1991 .
the european size 36 sandal , made of woven wood , was discovered in silt deposits on the site of an early settlement of lake dwellings built on stilts at the water 's edge .
schmalzl said european union funds would be used to research and preserve the areas where lake dwellings existed , on lake constance and lake zurich in neighboring switzerland .
the settlements were inhabited between the 4th and 1st century bc .
the remains , preserved for thousands of years by layers of silt , are under threat as a result of climate change , harbor construction and passing ships .
" this underwater archive is in danger , " schmalzl said .
the team working on protecting the ancient dwellings are ultimately hoping for unesco designation as a world heritage site .
they say it will help them to better protect the area and keep it closed to tourists .

in addition to the presence of foreign troops , the war sparked sectarian violence between sunnis and the iran-backed shiite muslims . biggest refugee group in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , 65,500 residents in germany were classified as refugees it remains unclear exactly how many iraqis have resettled in syria .
the unhcr has said roughly 1.5 million iraqi refugees are there , but the norwegian research institute fafo has claimed the actually number is only one-third of that . since 2003 , the unhcr has resettled thousands of iraqis in 16 countries .
iraqis make up the largest group of the 65,500 people classified as refugees living in germany , statistics show .
substantial number of refugees in germany hail from turkey , iran and afghanistan . asylum applications down germany 's federal office for migration and refugees said iraqis accounted for around one third of asylum applications received since the start of 2009 . still the number of asylum applicants in germany has declined over the past two years , meaning that the country " certainly has the capability " to take in refugees , amnesty international 's julia duchrow told the afp news agency last week . duchrow explained that successful asylum applicants were required to have a clean criminal record and could not have been members of former iraqi president saddam hussein 's baath party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugees in syria wait their turn to be processed by unhcr single mothers , those suffering from post-traumatic stress and people with ties to germany also had a greater chance of having their application for asylum approved , she added . other eu countries participating in the program to accept more iraqi refugees include britain , denmark , finland , the netherlands , norway and sweden . sweden urges eu countries to do more last week a senior swedish official urged other european nations to take in more iraqi refugees , saying that sweden will put the matter on its agenda when it assumes the six month eu presidency in july . in november , the european union agreed to take in 10,000 of the most vulnerable refugees from war-torn iraq .
the united states on the other hand had admitted only 1,200 refugees in 2007 , but has since opened its doors to over 12,000 asylum seekers , following criticism from the eu and international refugee organizations . df / sms / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's defense minister franz josef jung has promised more troops and is optimistic that the security situation is stabilizing . german defense minister franz josef jung said afghanistan was on the right path forward despite continual attacks . " i have the impression that things are going forward well , " said jung on wednesday , march 11 , in kabul .
this was also the case in the afghan capital , where the number of attacks had decreased , he said . jung had previously met with his afghan counterpart abdul rahim wardak as his three-day trip to uzbekistan and afghanistan wrapped up .
jung said the afghan government could count on german support during the presidential elections in august .
berlin would send 600 additional troops to help with security during that time , he said . " germany remains a reliable partner and a true friend of the afghan people and will fulfill its promises , " jung said . jung also met with the head of nato troops in afghanistan , gen. david mckiernan . kunduz stabilizing jung had previously visited the northern afghan city of kunduz .
he said the situation was stabilizing after three german soldiers were killed there last year .
jung said he saw significant indications of progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung took part in the groundbreaking for a new runway at masar-i-scharif airport however , tribal leaders he met with gave him mixed reports . " the security situation was bad , but for the past few months , we have been master of the situation with the help of our german friends , " dpa news agency quoted one leader as saying . another chief , however , said the international community must do more in the region . other participants at the meeting said they wished germany and other countries would bring more jobs and economic growth to afghanistan . prior to jung 's visit to the german army 's headquarters in kunduz , three rockets hit outside the camp , injuring no one but damaging a gate . taliban must renounce violence jung told reporters in kunduz that giving up violence would be " a necessary precondition for any agreement " with the taliban .
his comments followed statements by us president barack obama and vice president joe biden that the us would consider sitting down with moderate taliban members to seek a way of ending the fighting in afghanistan . but , it would be up to the afghan government in kabul to determine the chances of such talks succeeding , jung said . germany currently has more than 3,500 soldiers deployed in northern afghanistan as part of nato 's international security assistance force .

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice .

" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west .

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice .

" our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west .

but chancellor angela merkel is trying to convince worried germans that the country will be able to weather the storm . germany is experiencing the worst economic crisis in 60 years , said chancellor angela merkel . " we have never had this kind of a recession , taking place at the same time in all countries of the world , since world war ii , " merkel said in an interview with the mass-market daily bild published wednesday , march 11 .
" but i 'm certain that germany is better equipped than most countries to master this crisis . " merkel pointed out that , at the end of 2008 , germany enjoyed its highest level of employment in decades and its first balanced national budget in years . this , merkel argued , meant that the country would not only be able to cope with the current economic difficulties but also use the opportunity to make improvements . " we want to come out of this crisis stronger than we went into it , " merkel said . she also cited prominent examples from german history . " this year , we 're celebrating 60 years of the federal republic of germany and 20 years since the fall of the wall , " merkel said .

the bank 's supervisory board is set to review the books on april 24 and is expected to find a loss of several billion euros . the accounts must be balanced for the bank to prove it has enough equity and stave off nationalization .
various media sources have speculated that the lender may require a capital injection of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- . at the moment , hre is only staying solvent because of some 102 billion euros worth of mainly government-provided guarantees , leading many to believe a government take-over is almost inevitable . but merkel reassured critics that any acts of government intervention will be temporary , " wherever the state has to become a shareholder in a bank , it will pull out again as soon as this is possible , " she said . opel 's future dependent on clarity about gm meanwhile , merkel said the government would not get involved in troubled carmaker opel until the future of its parent company gm had been clarified in the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still hoping for brighter economic skies " we will support companies like opel if our help can ensure a good future for these companies and not only just go up in smoke after a company failed in the market , " merkel told the bild . she said the german government would only help those companies whose " benefit for all people in germany is greater than its damage .

but chancellor angela merkel is trying to convince worried germans that the country will be able to weather the storm . germany is experiencing the worst economic crisis in 60 years , said chancellor angela merkel . " we have never had this kind of a recession , taking place at the same time in all countries of the world , since world war ii , " merkel said in an interview with the mass-market daily bild published wednesday , march 11 .
" but i 'm certain that germany is better equipped than most countries to master this crisis . " merkel pointed out that , at the end of 2008 , germany enjoyed its highest level of employment in decades and its first balanced national budget in years . this , merkel argued , meant that the country would not only be able to cope with the current economic difficulties but also use the opportunity to make improvements . " we want to come out of this crisis stronger than we went into it , " merkel said . she also cited prominent examples from german history . " this year , we 're celebrating 60 years of the federal republic of germany and 20 years since the fall of the wall , " merkel said .
" thanks to our social market economy , we managed to rebuild the country after the war and tackle german reunification after 1989 . " clock is ticking for hre merkel also defended plans by finance minister peer steinbrueck to nationalize troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- .

" the excesses of the markets , which triggered the crisis , force us to cross over boundaries and do things which we otherwise would n't , " merkel said . but the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported on wednesday that hre 's time is running out .
the bank 's supervisory board is set to review the books on april 24 and is expected to find a loss of several billion euros . the accounts must be balanced for the bank to prove it has enough equity and stave off nationalization .
various media sources have speculated that the lender may require a capital injection of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- . at the moment , hre is only staying solvent because of some 102 billion euros worth of mainly government-provided guarantees , leading many to believe a government take-over is almost inevitable . but merkel reassured critics that any acts of government intervention will be temporary , " wherever the state has to become a shareholder in a bank , it will pull out again as soon as this is possible , " she said . opel 's future dependent on clarity about gm meanwhile , merkel said the government would not get involved in troubled carmaker opel until the future of its parent company gm had been clarified in the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still hoping for brighter economic skies " we will support companies like opel if our help can ensure a good future for these companies and not only just go up in smoke after a company failed in the market , " merkel told the bild . she said the german government would only help those companies whose " benefit for all people in germany is greater than its damage .

he was convicted and sentenced to death , but was then freed by a court that doubted the veracity of some of the evidence .
since the trial , evidence has been found to establish demjanjuk 's ss membership and that he served as a guard in sobibor . in the current attempt to bring him to justice , munich prosecutors applied for the warrant based on a document from bavarian criminal investigators that testified to the authenticity of the ss identity card provided by us officials . " the accused is currently still in the united states , " a court official said in a statement released in munich .
" as soon as he arrives in germany he will be questioned and tried . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some questioned the authenticity of demjanjuk 's id card the united states , which has already stripped demjanjuk of his citizenship , said late wednesday that it would continue to lend support to germany as it prosecutes the ukrainian-born suspect . demjanjuk , a retired auto worker in the us state of ohio , battled us authorities over his citizenship revocation for years , only to lose last year . demjanjuk lived in munich as a refugee shortly after the end of the world war ii before settling in the united states in 1952 .
however , allegations that he worked at the death camp have dogged him since the late 1970s . sms / jc / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .
" it 's impossible in this situation . " but others tried to draw some initial lessons from the tragic incident . " we need to ask what we can do in a preventive sense - what schools can do to be prepared and react correctly in critical moments , " family minister ursula von der leyen told reporters . " but we also need to ask : what are the patterns ? " she added .
" what triggers someone to run amok ? " recognition problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all of germany mourned for the victims the winnenden rampage is the latest in a string of school shootings in germany in the last decade . in 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western german town of emsdetten , wounding at least 11 people before committing suicide .
in april 2002 , a former student at a high school in the eastern city of erfurt killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself . psychologists say such acts of extreme , seemingly random violence result from a distorted relationship between the self and the outside world . " the young perpetrator ca n't find a way of getting recognition in reality , " karoline roshdi , a psychologist at the darmstadt university , told dw-tv .
" so they use violent fantasies to cope with this imbalanced situation .
they comb the media for examples of similar perpetrators to emulate and thereby gain recognition . " roshdi said the key to avoiding other shooting incidents in the future was recognizing the warning signs , including suicide threats and social isolation . " there are risk indicators , and we need to communicate if there 's a pupil at risk , " roshdi said .
" sometimes , an art teacher , for example , might notice one warning sign , and fellow students another one .
they need to be brought together . " too little supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts called for a number of measures they say would protect children in the immediate aftermath of the shootings , psychologists were brought in from throughout germany to help those affected cope with the trauma of what had happened . but questions were also raised as to whether the number of trained experts in german schools was adequate to prevent a repeat of wednesday 's tragic events . " in individual cases , some new posts -lsb- for school psychologists -rsb- have been created , but there are still far too few , " ap news agency reported . the agency said germany has only one psychologist per 12,000 students - compared to around one for every 770 students in denmark .
the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where winnenden is located , ranks near the bottom in germany . others questioned whether german laws concerning firearms , which were beefed up after the 2002 erfurt shootings , needed to be tightened even further .
it is thought that tim k. may have used a registered firearm belonging to his father to carry out the massacre . still others said the state should impose tighter restrictions on ultra-violent video games some think encourage psychologically unstable youngsters to act out their fantasies in real life . jc / sms / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .
" it 's impossible in this situation . " but others tried to draw some initial lessons from the tragic incident . " we need to ask what we can do in a preventive sense - what schools can do to be prepared and react correctly in critical moments , " family minister ursula von der leyen told reporters . " but we also need to ask : what are the patterns ? " she added .
" what triggers someone to run amok ? " recognition problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all of germany mourned for the victims the winnenden rampage is the latest in a string of school shootings in germany in the last decade . in 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western german town of emsdetten , wounding at least 11 people before committing suicide .
in april 2002 , a former student at a high school in the eastern city of erfurt killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself . psychologists say such acts of extreme , seemingly random violence result from a distorted relationship between the self and the outside world . " the young perpetrator ca n't find a way of getting recognition in reality , " karoline roshdi , a psychologist at the darmstadt university , told dw-tv .
" so they use violent fantasies to cope with this imbalanced situation .
they comb the media for examples of similar perpetrators to emulate and thereby gain recognition . " roshdi said the key to avoiding other shooting incidents in the future was recognizing the warning signs , including suicide threats and social isolation . " there are risk indicators , and we need to communicate if there 's a pupil at risk , " roshdi said .
" sometimes , an art teacher , for example , might notice one warning sign , and fellow students another one .
they need to be brought together . " too little supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts called for a number of measures they say would protect children in the immediate aftermath of the shootings , psychologists were brought in from throughout germany to help those affected cope with the trauma of what had happened . but questions were also raised as to whether the number of trained experts in german schools was adequate to prevent a repeat of wednesday 's tragic events . " in individual cases , some new posts -lsb- for school psychologists -rsb- have been created , but there are still far too few , " ap news agency reported . the agency said germany has only one psychologist per 12,000 students - compared to around one for every 770 students in denmark .
the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where winnenden is located , ranks near the bottom in germany . others questioned whether german laws concerning firearms , which were beefed up after the 2002 erfurt shootings , needed to be tightened even further .
it is thought that tim k. may have used a registered firearm belonging to his father to carry out the massacre . still others said the state should impose tighter restrictions on ultra-violent video games some think encourage psychologically unstable youngsters to act out their fantasies in real life . jc / sms / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the metropolis attracted 7.9 million visitors in 2008 - a gain of more than 4 percent over 2007 and the fifth year in a row a new record has been set . the mood in the tourism industry is generally somber , with german travel agents reporting plunging demand with the outbreak of the global economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes visitors will keep shelling out to see the sights " at the moment , it 's difficult , even impossible to predict because the market is indifferent , " christian taenzler , spokeman for the berlin tourism company , told deutsche welle .
" business travel is sluggish with trips being cancelled or shortened .
but in the leisure area , the hotels are well booked . " tourism is one of , if not the most important industry for the perennially cash-strapped german capital , and the number of annual visitors has more than doubled since the early 1990s . in tough economic times , luxuries such as vacations are often the first to face the axe as consumers rein in spending . but berlin tourism officials remain optimistic their city will defy the trend . taenzler said berlin has advantages that should continue to appeal to potential visitors . " poor but cheap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city has profited from budget airlines berlin 's tourist boom has been fueled by two major european budget airlines that allow weekend party-goers , for example , to pop over and enjoy the city 's internationally famous club scene . and it 's cheap to stay in as well as fly to berlin . " we may take a cut , but berlin is very competitive with cities like paris or london in terms of what you get for your money , " taenzler said .
" that goes from the price of a cup of cappuccino up to tickets for cultural events . " hotel prices are roughly half of what they are in other european capitals , and in recent years berlin has seen a virtual explosion in hostels , mostly located in the hip neighborhoods of mitte , prenzlauer berg and kreuzberg . " at the moment , we have n't noticed any effects from the financial crisis , " simone schueler , who operates the pegasus hostel in berlin 's friedrichshain district , told deutsche welle .
" we have to pay attention to our prices , but that 's because the hostel market itself has grown so much . " " poor but cultural " bildunterschrift : berlin has theaters of all sizes in nearly every district berlin also benefits from the number of cultural events on offer . recurrent highlights such as the berlin film festival attract visitors with specific interests at certain times of year , while others are drawn generally by the theater scene , the music performances or the nightlife . " another difference to london and paris is that ordinary people are usually able to get tickets for things they want to see , " taenzler said . it also probably does n't hurt that berlin 's bars are allowed to stay open round the clock . " i do n't think i 'm exaggerating when i say that , even in new york , berlin is known as absolutely the place to be right now , " taenzler said . " poor but historic " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city expects lots of visitors commemorating history this year ironically , the economic crisis may have come at the right time for berlin since the city expects lots of visitors to mark the 20th anniversary of one of the last century 's key events - the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 . that date has not escaped the notice of city tourism officials , who are doing their best to market the final days of communism to potential travelers . " the interest in the anniversary , especially abroad , has been very great , " taenzler said .
" and we 're already inviting journalists to the city in the hope that visitors will be inspired by their reports and follow them . " the tourist office has rolled out a bus , painted on the outside to look like the berlin wall , on the streets of amsterdam to encourage nostalgic dutch to take a sojourn to the german capital . none of these efforts by berlin 's promoters is likely to change the fact that the german capital remains relatively impecunious compared with other major european counterparts . but berlin officials are hoping that the relative lack of money floating around in what used to be a western island in the warsaw pact will turn out to be an advantage in times where many people have to budget their holidays more carefully . author : jefferson chase editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's defense minister franz josef jung has promised more troops and is optimistic that the security situation is stabilizing . german defense minister franz josef jung said afghanistan was on the right path forward despite continual attacks . " i have the impression that things are going forward well , " said jung on wednesday , march 11 , in kabul .
this was also the case in the afghan capital , where the number of attacks had decreased , he said . jung had previously met with his afghan counterpart abdul rahim wardak as his three-day trip to uzbekistan and afghanistan wrapped up .
jung said the afghan government could count on german support during the presidential elections in august .
berlin would send 600 additional troops to help with security during that time , he said . " germany remains a reliable partner and a true friend of the afghan people and will fulfill its promises , " jung said . jung also met with the head of nato troops in afghanistan , gen. david mckiernan . kunduz stabilizing jung had previously visited the northern afghan city of kunduz .
he said the situation was stabilizing after three german soldiers were killed there last year .
jung said he saw significant indications of progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung took part in the groundbreaking for a new runway at masar-i-scharif airport however , tribal leaders he met with gave him mixed reports . " the security situation was bad , but for the past few months , we have been master of the situation with the help of our german friends , " dpa news agency quoted one leader as saying . another chief , however , said the international community must do more in the region . other participants at the meeting said they wished germany and other countries would bring more jobs and economic growth to afghanistan . prior to jung 's visit to the german army 's headquarters in kunduz , three rockets hit outside the camp , injuring no one but damaging a gate . taliban must renounce violence jung told reporters in kunduz that giving up violence would be " a necessary precondition for any agreement " with the taliban .
his comments followed statements by us president barack obama and vice president joe biden that the us would consider sitting down with moderate taliban members to seek a way of ending the fighting in afghanistan . but , it would be up to the afghan government in kabul to determine the chances of such talks succeeding , jung said . germany currently has more than 3,500 soldiers deployed in northern afghanistan as part of nato 's international security assistance force .
jung said it would not further increase its military contingent in afghanistan , despite appeals from washington . sac / sms / afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west . " however , two recent public-opinion polls show that a substantial majority of the french favors the decision . sms / jc / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 11.03.2009 france to rejoin nato military command after 43 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france will once again begin to take full part in nato decision making french president nicolas sarkozy confirmed on wednesday that france will be rejoining nato 's military command structure , saying the move was in the best security interests of his country and of europe . sarkozy said on wednesday , march 11 , that france would return to the nato military command and seek a larger role as a full partner of the united states and its other atlantic allies . " nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west . " however , two recent public-opinion polls show that a substantial majority of the french favors the decision . sms / jc / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer .

" sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.03.2009 observers say germany must be better prepared for school shootings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany wondered how the country should move forward to prevent future tragedy germany reeled with shock after a 17-year-old gunned down students at a school in a rampage that left 15 dead before he took his own life .
but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .
" it 's impossible in this situation . " but others tried to draw some initial lessons from the tragic incident . " we need to ask what we can do in a preventive sense - what schools can do to be prepared and react correctly in critical moments , " family minister ursula von der leyen told reporters . " but we also need to ask : what are the patterns ? " she added .
" what triggers someone to run amok ? " recognition problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all of germany mourned for the victims the winnenden rampage is the latest in a string of school shootings in germany in the last decade . in 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western german town of emsdetten , wounding at least 11 people before committing suicide .
in april 2002 , a former student at a high school in the eastern city of erfurt killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself . psychologists say such acts of extreme , seemingly random violence result from a distorted relationship between the self and the outside world . " the young perpetrator ca n't find a way of getting recognition in reality , " karoline roshdi , a psychologist at the darmstadt university , told dw-tv .
" so they use violent fantasies to cope with this imbalanced situation .
they comb the media for examples of similar perpetrators to emulate and thereby gain recognition . " roshdi said the key to avoiding other shooting incidents in the future was recognizing the warning signs , including suicide threats and social isolation . " there are risk indicators , and we need to communicate if there 's a pupil at risk , " roshdi said .
" sometimes , an art teacher , for example , might notice one warning sign , and fellow students another one .
they need to be brought together . " too little supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts called for a number of measures they say would protect children in the immediate aftermath of the shootings , psychologists were brought in from throughout germany to help those affected cope with the trauma of what had happened . but questions were also raised as to whether the number of trained experts in german schools was adequate to prevent a repeat of wednesday 's tragic events . " in individual cases , some new posts -lsb- for school psychologists -rsb- have been created , but there are still far too few , " ap news agency reported . the agency said germany has only one psychologist per 12,000 students - compared to around one for every 770 students in denmark .
the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where winnenden is located , ranks near the bottom in germany . others questioned whether german laws concerning firearms , which were beefed up after the 2002 erfurt shootings , needed to be tightened even further .
it is thought that tim k. may have used a registered firearm belonging to his father to carry out the massacre . still others said the state should impose tighter restrictions on ultra-violent video games some think encourage psychologically unstable youngsters to act out their fantasies in real life . jc / sms / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he described the find as a " small sensation , " comparing it to fragments of clothing once worn by oetzi , an alpine ice man whose 5,000-year-old mummified body was discovered in a melting glacier in the nearby alps in 1991 .
the european size 36 sandal , made of woven wood , was discovered in silt deposits on the site of an early settlement of lake dwellings built on stilts at the water 's edge .
schmalzl said european union funds would be used to research and preserve the areas where lake dwellings existed , on lake constance and lake zurich in neighboring switzerland .
the settlements were inhabited between the 4th and 1st century bc .
the remains , preserved for thousands of years by layers of silt , are under threat as a result of climate change , harbor construction and passing ships .
" this underwater archive is in danger , " schmalzl said .
the team working on protecting the ancient dwellings are ultimately hoping for unesco designation as a world heritage site .

but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .
" it 's impossible in this situation . " but others tried to draw some initial lessons from the tragic incident . " we need to ask what we can do in a preventive sense - what schools can do to be prepared and react correctly in critical moments , " family minister ursula von der leyen told reporters .

in april 2002 , a former student at a high school in the eastern city of erfurt killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself . psychologists say such acts of extreme , seemingly random violence result from a distorted relationship between the self and the outside world . " the young perpetrator ca n't find a way of getting recognition in reality , " karoline roshdi , a psychologist at the darmstadt university , told dw-tv .
" so they use violent fantasies to cope with this imbalanced situation .
they comb the media for examples of similar perpetrators to emulate and thereby gain recognition . " roshdi said the key to avoiding other shooting incidents in the future was recognizing the warning signs , including suicide threats and social isolation . " there are risk indicators , and we need to communicate if there 's a pupil at risk , " roshdi said .
" sometimes , an art teacher , for example , might notice one warning sign , and fellow students another one .
they need to be brought together .

" in individual cases , some new posts -lsb- for school psychologists -rsb- have been created , but there are still far too few , " ap news agency reported . the agency said germany has only one psychologist per 12,000 students - compared to around one for every 770 students in denmark .

but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .
" it 's impossible in this situation . " but others tried to draw some initial lessons from the tragic incident . " we need to ask what we can do in a preventive sense - what schools can do to be prepared and react correctly in critical moments , " family minister ursula von der leyen told reporters .

but chancellor angela merkel is trying to convince worried germans that the country will be able to weather the storm . germany is experiencing the worst economic crisis in 60 years , said chancellor angela merkel . " we have never had this kind of a recession , taking place at the same time in all countries of the world , since world war ii , " merkel said in an interview with the mass-market daily bild published wednesday , march 11 .
" but i 'm certain that germany is better equipped than most countries to master this crisis . " merkel pointed out that , at the end of 2008 , germany enjoyed its highest level of employment in decades and its first balanced national budget in years . this , merkel argued , meant that the country would not only be able to cope with the current economic difficulties but also use the opportunity to make improvements . " we want to come out of this crisis stronger than we went into it , " merkel said . she also cited prominent examples from german history . " this year , we 're celebrating 60 years of the federal republic of germany and 20 years since the fall of the wall , " merkel said .

the bank 's supervisory board is set to review the books on april 24 and is expected to find a loss of several billion euros . the accounts must be balanced for the bank to prove it has enough equity and stave off nationalization .
various media sources have speculated that the lender may require a capital injection of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- . at the moment , hre is only staying solvent because of some 102 billion euros worth of mainly government-provided guarantees , leading many to believe a government take-over is almost inevitable . but merkel reassured critics that any acts of government intervention will be temporary , " wherever the state has to become a shareholder in a bank , it will pull out again as soon as this is possible , " she said . opel 's future dependent on clarity about gm meanwhile , merkel said the government would not get involved in troubled carmaker opel until the future of its parent company gm had been clarified in the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still hoping for brighter economic skies " we will support companies like opel if our help can ensure a good future for these companies and not only just go up in smoke after a company failed in the market , " merkel told the bild . she said the german government would only help those companies whose " benefit for all people in germany is greater than its damage .

but chancellor angela merkel is trying to convince worried germans that the country will be able to weather the storm . germany is experiencing the worst economic crisis in 60 years , said chancellor angela merkel . " we have never had this kind of a recession , taking place at the same time in all countries of the world , since world war ii , " merkel said in an interview with the mass-market daily bild published wednesday , march 11 .
" but i 'm certain that germany is better equipped than most countries to master this crisis . " merkel pointed out that , at the end of 2008 , germany enjoyed its highest level of employment in decades and its first balanced national budget in years . this , merkel argued , meant that the country would not only be able to cope with the current economic difficulties but also use the opportunity to make improvements . " we want to come out of this crisis stronger than we went into it , " merkel said . she also cited prominent examples from german history . " this year , we 're celebrating 60 years of the federal republic of germany and 20 years since the fall of the wall , " merkel said .

can the german capital draw similar numbers this year as the global economic crisis hammers tourism worldwide ? as the international tourism fair itb opens in berlin on wednesday , march 11 , the city announced another record-setting performance in precisely that area .
the metropolis attracted 7.9 million visitors in 2008 - a gain of more than 4 percent over 2007 and the fifth year in a row a new record has been set . the mood in the tourism industry is generally somber , with german travel agents reporting plunging demand with the outbreak of the global economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes visitors will keep shelling out to see the sights " at the moment , it 's difficult , even impossible to predict because the market is indifferent , " christian taenzler , spokeman for the berlin tourism company , told deutsche welle .
" business travel is sluggish with trips being cancelled or shortened .
but in the leisure area , the hotels are well booked . " tourism is one of , if not the most important industry for the perennially cash-strapped german capital , and the number of annual visitors has more than doubled since the early 1990s . in tough economic times , luxuries such as vacations are often the first to face the axe as consumers rein in spending . but berlin tourism officials remain optimistic their city will defy the trend . taenzler said berlin has advantages that should continue to appeal to potential visitors . " poor but cheap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city has profited from budget airlines berlin 's tourist boom has been fueled by two major european budget airlines that allow weekend party-goers , for example , to pop over and enjoy the city 's internationally famous club scene . and it 's cheap to stay in as well as fly to berlin . " we may take a cut , but berlin is very competitive with cities like paris or london in terms of what you get for your money , " taenzler said .
" that goes from the price of a cup of cappuccino up to tickets for cultural events . " hotel prices are roughly half of what they are in other european capitals , and in recent years berlin has seen a virtual explosion in hostels , mostly located in the hip neighborhoods of mitte , prenzlauer berg and kreuzberg . " at the moment , we have n't noticed any effects from the financial crisis , " simone schueler , who operates the pegasus hostel in berlin 's friedrichshain district , told deutsche welle .

can the german capital draw similar numbers this year as the global economic crisis hammers tourism worldwide ? as the international tourism fair itb opens in berlin on wednesday , march 11 , the city announced another record-setting performance in precisely that area .
the metropolis attracted 7.9 million visitors in 2008 - a gain of more than 4 percent over 2007 and the fifth year in a row a new record has been set . the mood in the tourism industry is generally somber , with german travel agents reporting plunging demand with the outbreak of the global economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes visitors will keep shelling out to see the sights " at the moment , it 's difficult , even impossible to predict because the market is indifferent , " christian taenzler , spokeman for the berlin tourism company , told deutsche welle .
" business travel is sluggish with trips being cancelled or shortened .
but in the leisure area , the hotels are well booked . " tourism is one of , if not the most important industry for the perennially cash-strapped german capital , and the number of annual visitors has more than doubled since the early 1990s . in tough economic times , luxuries such as vacations are often the first to face the axe as consumers rein in spending . but berlin tourism officials remain optimistic their city will defy the trend . taenzler said berlin has advantages that should continue to appeal to potential visitors . " poor but cheap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city has profited from budget airlines berlin 's tourist boom has been fueled by two major european budget airlines that allow weekend party-goers , for example , to pop over and enjoy the city 's internationally famous club scene . and it 's cheap to stay in as well as fly to berlin . " we may take a cut , but berlin is very competitive with cities like paris or london in terms of what you get for your money , " taenzler said .
" that goes from the price of a cup of cappuccino up to tickets for cultural events . " hotel prices are roughly half of what they are in other european capitals , and in recent years berlin has seen a virtual explosion in hostels , mostly located in the hip neighborhoods of mitte , prenzlauer berg and kreuzberg . " at the moment , we have n't noticed any effects from the financial crisis , " simone schueler , who operates the pegasus hostel in berlin 's friedrichshain district , told deutsche welle .
" we have to pay attention to our prices , but that 's because the hostel market itself has grown so much . " " poor but cultural " bildunterschrift : berlin has theaters of all sizes in nearly every district berlin also benefits from the number of cultural events on offer . recurrent highlights such as the berlin film festival attract visitors with specific interests at certain times of year , while others are drawn generally by the theater scene , the music performances or the nightlife .

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west . " however , two recent public-opinion polls show that a substantial majority of the french favors the decision . sms / jc / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west . " however , two recent public-opinion polls show that a substantial majority of the french favors the decision . sms / jc / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .
" it 's impossible in this situation . " but others tried to draw some initial lessons from the tragic incident . " we need to ask what we can do in a preventive sense - what schools can do to be prepared and react correctly in critical moments , " family minister ursula von der leyen told reporters . " but we also need to ask : what are the patterns ? " she added .
" what triggers someone to run amok ? " recognition problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all of germany mourned for the victims the winnenden rampage is the latest in a string of school shootings in germany in the last decade . in 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western german town of emsdetten , wounding at least 11 people before committing suicide .
in april 2002 , a former student at a high school in the eastern city of erfurt killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself . psychologists say such acts of extreme , seemingly random violence result from a distorted relationship between the self and the outside world . " the young perpetrator ca n't find a way of getting recognition in reality , " karoline roshdi , a psychologist at the darmstadt university , told dw-tv .
" so they use violent fantasies to cope with this imbalanced situation .
they comb the media for examples of similar perpetrators to emulate and thereby gain recognition . " roshdi said the key to avoiding other shooting incidents in the future was recognizing the warning signs , including suicide threats and social isolation . " there are risk indicators , and we need to communicate if there 's a pupil at risk , " roshdi said .
" sometimes , an art teacher , for example , might notice one warning sign , and fellow students another one .
they need to be brought together . " too little supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts called for a number of measures they say would protect children in the immediate aftermath of the shootings , psychologists were brought in from throughout germany to help those affected cope with the trauma of what had happened . but questions were also raised as to whether the number of trained experts in german schools was adequate to prevent a repeat of wednesday 's tragic events . " in individual cases , some new posts -lsb- for school psychologists -rsb- have been created , but there are still far too few , " ap news agency reported . the agency said germany has only one psychologist per 12,000 students - compared to around one for every 770 students in denmark .
the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where winnenden is located , ranks near the bottom in germany . others questioned whether german laws concerning firearms , which were beefed up after the 2002 erfurt shootings , needed to be tightened even further .

but chancellor angela merkel is trying to convince worried germans that the country will be able to weather the storm . germany is experiencing the worst economic crisis in 60 years , said chancellor angela merkel . " we have never had this kind of a recession , taking place at the same time in all countries of the world , since world war ii , " merkel said in an interview with the mass-market daily bild published wednesday , march 11 .
" but i 'm certain that germany is better equipped than most countries to master this crisis . " merkel pointed out that , at the end of 2008 , germany enjoyed its highest level of employment in decades and its first balanced national budget in years . this , merkel argued , meant that the country would not only be able to cope with the current economic difficulties but also use the opportunity to make improvements . " we want to come out of this crisis stronger than we went into it , " merkel said . she also cited prominent examples from german history . " this year , we 're celebrating 60 years of the federal republic of germany and 20 years since the fall of the wall , " merkel said .
" thanks to our social market economy , we managed to rebuild the country after the war and tackle german reunification after 1989 . " clock is ticking for hre merkel also defended plans by finance minister peer steinbrueck to nationalize troubled mortgage lender hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- .
it 's a move that has been criticized by many of the chancellor 's fellow conservatives in her party of christian democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hre only has a few weeks to get its finances in order steinbrueck , a member of merkel 's coalition partner the social democrats , has drafted a draft law allowing the nationalization .
it is scheduled to come up for a parliamentary vote later this month . " the excesses of the markets , which triggered the crisis , force us to cross over boundaries and do things which we otherwise would n't , " merkel said . but the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported on wednesday that hre 's time is running out .
the bank 's supervisory board is set to review the books on april 24 and is expected to find a loss of several billion euros . the accounts must be balanced for the bank to prove it has enough equity and stave off nationalization .
various media sources have speculated that the lender may require a capital injection of 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- . at the moment , hre is only staying solvent because of some 102 billion euros worth of mainly government-provided guarantees , leading many to believe a government take-over is almost inevitable . but merkel reassured critics that any acts of government intervention will be temporary , " wherever the state has to become a shareholder in a bank , it will pull out again as soon as this is possible , " she said . opel 's future dependent on clarity about gm meanwhile , merkel said the government would not get involved in troubled carmaker opel until the future of its parent company gm had been clarified in the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still hoping for brighter economic skies " we will support companies like opel if our help can ensure a good future for these companies and not only just go up in smoke after a company failed in the market , " merkel told the bild . she said the german government would only help those companies whose " benefit for all people in germany is greater than its damage . " " state aid can only act as a bridge for the problems of the financial crisis , after which companies must be successful in the market under their own power , " merkel said . the german government has been burned in the past by troubled companies - for example , several years ago , when berlin pumped funds into construction group philipp holzmann only to have it declare bankruptcy shortly thereafter . sac / jc / sms send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the metropolis attracted 7.9 million visitors in 2008 - a gain of more than 4 percent over 2007 and the fifth year in a row a new record has been set . the mood in the tourism industry is generally somber , with german travel agents reporting plunging demand with the outbreak of the global economic crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes visitors will keep shelling out to see the sights " at the moment , it 's difficult , even impossible to predict because the market is indifferent , " christian taenzler , spokeman for the berlin tourism company , told deutsche welle .
" business travel is sluggish with trips being cancelled or shortened .
but in the leisure area , the hotels are well booked . " tourism is one of , if not the most important industry for the perennially cash-strapped german capital , and the number of annual visitors has more than doubled since the early 1990s . in tough economic times , luxuries such as vacations are often the first to face the axe as consumers rein in spending . but berlin tourism officials remain optimistic their city will defy the trend . taenzler said berlin has advantages that should continue to appeal to potential visitors . " poor but cheap " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city has profited from budget airlines berlin 's tourist boom has been fueled by two major european budget airlines that allow weekend party-goers , for example , to pop over and enjoy the city 's internationally famous club scene . and it 's cheap to stay in as well as fly to berlin . " we may take a cut , but berlin is very competitive with cities like paris or london in terms of what you get for your money , " taenzler said .
" that goes from the price of a cup of cappuccino up to tickets for cultural events . " hotel prices are roughly half of what they are in other european capitals , and in recent years berlin has seen a virtual explosion in hostels , mostly located in the hip neighborhoods of mitte , prenzlauer berg and kreuzberg . " at the moment , we have n't noticed any effects from the financial crisis , " simone schueler , who operates the pegasus hostel in berlin 's friedrichshain district , told deutsche welle .
" we have to pay attention to our prices , but that 's because the hostel market itself has grown so much . " " poor but cultural " bildunterschrift : berlin has theaters of all sizes in nearly every district berlin also benefits from the number of cultural events on offer . recurrent highlights such as the berlin film festival attract visitors with specific interests at certain times of year , while others are drawn generally by the theater scene , the music performances or the nightlife . " another difference to london and paris is that ordinary people are usually able to get tickets for things they want to see , " taenzler said . it also probably does n't hurt that berlin 's bars are allowed to stay open round the clock . " i do n't think i 'm exaggerating when i say that , even in new york , berlin is known as absolutely the place to be right now , " taenzler said . " poor but historic " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city expects lots of visitors commemorating history this year ironically , the economic crisis may have come at the right time for berlin since the city expects lots of visitors to mark the 20th anniversary of one of the last century 's key events - the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989 . that date has not escaped the notice of city tourism officials , who are doing their best to market the final days of communism to potential travelers . " the interest in the anniversary , especially abroad , has been very great , " taenzler said .
" and we 're already inviting journalists to the city in the hope that visitors will be inspired by their reports and follow them . " the tourist office has rolled out a bus , painted on the outside to look like the berlin wall , on the streets of amsterdam to encourage nostalgic dutch to take a sojourn to the german capital . none of these efforts by berlin 's promoters is likely to change the fact that the german capital remains relatively impecunious compared with other major european counterparts . but berlin officials are hoping that the relative lack of money floating around in what used to be a western island in the warsaw pact will turn out to be an advantage in times where many people have to budget their holidays more carefully . author : jefferson chase editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's defense minister franz josef jung has promised more troops and is optimistic that the security situation is stabilizing . german defense minister franz josef jung said afghanistan was on the right path forward despite continual attacks . " i have the impression that things are going forward well , " said jung on wednesday , march 11 , in kabul .
this was also the case in the afghan capital , where the number of attacks had decreased , he said . jung had previously met with his afghan counterpart abdul rahim wardak as his three-day trip to uzbekistan and afghanistan wrapped up .
jung said the afghan government could count on german support during the presidential elections in august .
berlin would send 600 additional troops to help with security during that time , he said . " germany remains a reliable partner and a true friend of the afghan people and will fulfill its promises , " jung said . jung also met with the head of nato troops in afghanistan , gen. david mckiernan . kunduz stabilizing jung had previously visited the northern afghan city of kunduz .
he said the situation was stabilizing after three german soldiers were killed there last year .
jung said he saw significant indications of progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung took part in the groundbreaking for a new runway at masar-i-scharif airport however , tribal leaders he met with gave him mixed reports . " the security situation was bad , but for the past few months , we have been master of the situation with the help of our german friends , " dpa news agency quoted one leader as saying . another chief , however , said the international community must do more in the region . other participants at the meeting said they wished germany and other countries would bring more jobs and economic growth to afghanistan . prior to jung 's visit to the german army 's headquarters in kunduz , three rockets hit outside the camp , injuring no one but damaging a gate . taliban must renounce violence jung told reporters in kunduz that giving up violence would be " a necessary precondition for any agreement " with the taliban .
his comments followed statements by us president barack obama and vice president joe biden that the us would consider sitting down with moderate taliban members to seek a way of ending the fighting in afghanistan . but , it would be up to the afghan government in kabul to determine the chances of such talks succeeding , jung said . germany currently has more than 3,500 soldiers deployed in northern afghanistan as part of nato 's international security assistance force .
jung said it would not further increase its military contingent in afghanistan , despite appeals from washington . sac / sms / afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in addition to the presence of foreign troops , the war sparked sectarian violence between sunnis and the iran-backed shiite muslims . biggest refugee group in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , 65,500 residents in germany were classified as refugees it remains unclear exactly how many iraqis have resettled in syria .
the unhcr has said roughly 1.5 million iraqi refugees are there , but the norwegian research institute fafo has claimed the actually number is only one-third of that . since 2003 , the unhcr has resettled thousands of iraqis in 16 countries .
iraqis make up the largest group of the 65,500 people classified as refugees living in germany , statistics show .
substantial number of refugees in germany hail from turkey , iran and afghanistan . asylum applications down germany 's federal office for migration and refugees said iraqis accounted for around one third of asylum applications received since the start of 2009 . still the number of asylum applicants in germany has declined over the past two years , meaning that the country " certainly has the capability " to take in refugees , amnesty international 's julia duchrow told the afp news agency last week . duchrow explained that successful asylum applicants were required to have a clean criminal record and could not have been members of former iraqi president saddam hussein 's baath party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi refugees in syria wait their turn to be processed by unhcr single mothers , those suffering from post-traumatic stress and people with ties to germany also had a greater chance of having their application for asylum approved , she added . other eu countries participating in the program to accept more iraqi refugees include britain , denmark , finland , the netherlands , norway and sweden . sweden urges eu countries to do more last week a senior swedish official urged other european nations to take in more iraqi refugees , saying that sweden will put the matter on its agenda when it assumes the six month eu presidency in july . in november , the european union agreed to take in 10,000 of the most vulnerable refugees from war-torn iraq .
the united states on the other hand had admitted only 1,200 refugees in 2007 , but has since opened its doors to over 12,000 asylum seekers , following criticism from the eu and international refugee organizations . df / sms / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was convicted and sentenced to death , but was then freed by a court that doubted the veracity of some of the evidence .
since the trial , evidence has been found to establish demjanjuk 's ss membership and that he served as a guard in sobibor . in the current attempt to bring him to justice , munich prosecutors applied for the warrant based on a document from bavarian criminal investigators that testified to the authenticity of the ss identity card provided by us officials . " the accused is currently still in the united states , " a court official said in a statement released in munich .
" as soon as he arrives in germany he will be questioned and tried . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some questioned the authenticity of demjanjuk 's id card the united states , which has already stripped demjanjuk of his citizenship , said late wednesday that it would continue to lend support to germany as it prosecutes the ukrainian-born suspect . demjanjuk , a retired auto worker in the us state of ohio , battled us authorities over his citizenship revocation for years , only to lose last year . demjanjuk lived in munich as a refugee shortly after the end of the world war ii before settling in the united states in 1952 .

he was convicted and sentenced to death , but was then freed by a court that doubted the veracity of some of the evidence .
since the trial , evidence has been found to establish demjanjuk 's ss membership and that he served as a guard in sobibor . in the current attempt to bring him to justice , munich prosecutors applied for the warrant based on a document from bavarian criminal investigators that testified to the authenticity of the ss identity card provided by us officials . " the accused is currently still in the united states , " a court official said in a statement released in munich .
" as soon as he arrives in germany he will be questioned and tried . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some questioned the authenticity of demjanjuk 's id card the united states , which has already stripped demjanjuk of his citizenship , said late wednesday that it would continue to lend support to germany as it prosecutes the ukrainian-born suspect . demjanjuk , a retired auto worker in the us state of ohio , battled us authorities over his citizenship revocation for years , only to lose last year . demjanjuk lived in munich as a refugee shortly after the end of the world war ii before settling in the united states in 1952 .
however , allegations that he worked at the death camp have dogged him since the late 1970s . sms / jc / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " at 9:30 a.m. local time , a 17-year-old identified only as tim k. entered the albertville school in winnenden - a town of 27,600 , near stuttgart in southwestern germany - and began shooting randomly . nine students , aged between15 and 16 , and three teachers died in this initial attack . " i heard two shots and then a scream , " a 15-year-old pupil inside the school told ap news agency .
" at first , i thought it was a joke , but then someone yelled : ' run , run ! " ' police said that two emergency squads were immediately dispatched to the school , but that the gunman had already hijacked a car and fled to the town of wendlingen - around 40 kilometers away . police said the gunman shot dead three bystanders , before taking his own life .
authorities corrected earlier reports saying the teenager was killed by police in a shoot-out . authorities estimated the total death toll to be at least 16 , although initial details about those injured were sketchy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winnenden is located in the state of baden-wuerttemberg in southwestern germany the gunman 's father was a member of a local rifle club , and police who searched the family home found one pistol along with some 100 bullets missing . wednesday 's shooting followed a rampage in the united states on tuesday in which a gunman shot dead 11 people then killed himself in southern alabama . string of school shootings the winnenden incident is the latest in a string of school shootings in germany in recent years . in 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western german town of emsdetten , wounding at least eleven people before committing suicide . in april 2002 , a gunman killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself at a high school in the eastern city erfurt in the worst such incident . german politicians and community leaders were unanimous in condemning the latest shooting spree . ulrich wilhelm , spokesman for the federal government in berlin , told reporters that the winnenden incident was " horrific " but that the police had done all they could . jc / sms / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . " its full participation in all the civil and military decision-making and planning processes can not but strengthen the alliance further , " scheffer said in a statement .
" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice . " france no longer ' in-between ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's command to protest us influence in europe de gaulle 's cold war view was that france should act as a bridge between the east and west , but the time for such views has gone , sarkozy said . " our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west .

" nato is the only major organization in the world in which france does not seek to have a major say , " sarkozy said in a speech in paris .
" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer .

" sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .

i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west .

" it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " at 9:30 a.m. local time , a 17-year-old identified only as tim k. entered the albertville school in winnenden - a town of 27,600 , near stuttgart in southwestern germany - and began shooting randomly . nine students , aged between15 and 16 , and three teachers died in this initial attack . " i heard two shots and then a scream , " a 15-year-old pupil inside the school told ap news agency .
" at first , i thought it was a joke , but then someone yelled : ' run , run ! " ' police said that two emergency squads were immediately dispatched to the school , but that the gunman had already hijacked a car and fled to the town of wendlingen - around 40 kilometers away . police said the gunman shot dead three bystanders , before taking his own life .

but now some are also saying the country needs to learn from this latest tragedy . german chancellor angela merkel did her best to sum up the nation 's feelings on wednesday , march 11 , after a 17-year-old former school pupil went on a shooting rampage at his former school and in a nearby town . " it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .
" it 's impossible in this situation . " but others tried to draw some initial lessons from the tragic incident . " we need to ask what we can do in a preventive sense - what schools can do to be prepared and react correctly in critical moments , " family minister ursula von der leyen told reporters . " but we also need to ask : what are the patterns ? " she added .
" what triggers someone to run amok ? " recognition problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said all of germany mourned for the victims the winnenden rampage is the latest in a string of school shootings in germany in the last decade . in 2006 , a masked man opened fire at a school in the western german town of emsdetten , wounding at least 11 people before committing suicide .
in april 2002 , a former student at a high school in the eastern city of erfurt killed 17 students and teachers before killing himself . psychologists say such acts of extreme , seemingly random violence result from a distorted relationship between the self and the outside world . " the young perpetrator ca n't find a way of getting recognition in reality , " karoline roshdi , a psychologist at the darmstadt university , told dw-tv .
" so they use violent fantasies to cope with this imbalanced situation .
they comb the media for examples of similar perpetrators to emulate and thereby gain recognition . " roshdi said the key to avoiding other shooting incidents in the future was recognizing the warning signs , including suicide threats and social isolation . " there are risk indicators , and we need to communicate if there 's a pupil at risk , " roshdi said .
" sometimes , an art teacher , for example , might notice one warning sign , and fellow students another one .
they need to be brought together . " too little supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts called for a number of measures they say would protect children in the immediate aftermath of the shootings , psychologists were brought in from throughout germany to help those affected cope with the trauma of what had happened . but questions were also raised as to whether the number of trained experts in german schools was adequate to prevent a repeat of wednesday 's tragic events . " in individual cases , some new posts -lsb- for school psychologists -rsb- have been created , but there are still far too few , " ap news agency reported . the agency said germany has only one psychologist per 12,000 students - compared to around one for every 770 students in denmark .
the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where winnenden is located , ranks near the bottom in germany . others questioned whether german laws concerning firearms , which were beefed up after the 2002 erfurt shootings , needed to be tightened even further .
it is thought that tim k. may have used a registered firearm belonging to his father to carry out the massacre . still others said the state should impose tighter restrictions on ultra-violent video games some think encourage psychologically unstable youngsters to act out their fantasies in real life . jc / sms / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .

" it 's time to put an end to this situation . " the national interest of france must lead to a return to nato , " he added . france 's return to the nato command would also increase europe 's influence within the alliance and bolster the defense of continent , sarkozy said .
the president 's speech heralding the move came 43 years after charles de gaulle pulled france out of nato 's military command and evicted us military bases from french soil . while it is returning to the military command , sarkozy said paris would retain its independent nuclear capabilities and officials said france did not plan to join the organization 's nuclear planning committee . eu welcomes return bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france , the eu and nato would benefit from added french participation in nato present at the speech , which was held at paris ' ecole militaire , were eu foreign affairs chief javier solana and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer .

" i shall make sure that all steps are taken to ensure implementation of the french decision . " solana welcomed the french decision , saying , " everyone is prepared to recognize that we need a strong nato and a strong european security and defense policy in the eu . " sarkozy said that his decision was " the end of a long process " of reintegration . " since 1966 , france has been moving closer to nato , but without saying it , " he said .
" it was a continuous process , by governments of the left and the right .
it was our collective choice .

" our friends and our allies are all in the west ...
i do n't think france can be in-between , " he said .
" that would mean france is nowhere . " a return to nato 's military structure would give paris , which contributes troops to nato missions , a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of soldiers to nato and currently has some 3,000 troops deployed in and around afghanistan . sarkozy 's decision has stirred some protest in france , particularly from die-hard gaullists within sarkozy 's own ump party and from his political opposition on the left and centre .
the socialist politician who sarkozy defeated in the 2007 presidential election , segolene royal , has been particularly critical of the move , describing nato as the " armed wing of the west .

" it 's a day of sorrow for all of germany , " merkel told reporters in berlin .
" it is incomprehensible that , within seconds , a terrible crime took pupils and teachers to their deaths . " the party leader of the social democrats , franz muentefering , was likewise hard-pressed to express his sorrow at the deaths of students , teachers and bystanders in and near the town of winnenden .
the perpetrator , identified only as tim k. , eventually killed himself when cornered by police on wedneseday . " you feel helpless because you know you ca n't offer any immediate consolation , " muentefering said .

he was convicted and sentenced to death , but was then freed by a court that doubted the veracity of some of the evidence .
since the trial , evidence has been found to establish demjanjuk 's ss membership and that he served as a guard in sobibor . in the current attempt to bring him to justice , munich prosecutors applied for the warrant based on a document from bavarian criminal investigators that testified to the authenticity of the ss identity card provided by us officials . " the accused is currently still in the united states , " a court official said in a statement released in munich .
" as soon as he arrives in germany he will be questioned and tried . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some questioned the authenticity of demjanjuk 's id card the united states , which has already stripped demjanjuk of his citizenship , said late wednesday that it would continue to lend support to germany as it prosecutes the ukrainian-born suspect . demjanjuk , a retired auto worker in the us state of ohio , battled us authorities over his citizenship revocation for years , only to lose last year . demjanjuk lived in munich as a refugee shortly after the end of the world war ii before settling in the united states in 1952 .
however , allegations that he worked at the death camp have dogged him since the late 1970s . sms / jc / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

curbs on sending medicines and food have also been eased .
the measures were part of a $ 410bn bill to fund us government operations .
the legislation was approved by the senate after clearing the house of representatives last month .
the bill was supported by two cuban-american senators who had initially opposed it .
they changed their votes after receiving assurances from the obama administration that the changes did not amount to a major reversal of the 47-year-old us trade embargo on cuba .
lifeline the legislation overturns rules imposed by the bush administration which limited travel to just two weeks every three years , and confined visits to immediate family members .
president obama - who needs to sign the bill - has said he supports it .
he has also indicated that he would be open to dialogue with cuba 's leaders .
but he has said that like previous american presidents , he will only consider a full lifting of the embargo once cuba 's communist government makes significant moves such as the holding of democratic elections .
cuba 's president raul castro has said he is prepared to negotiate with the new us administration , providing there are no preconditions .
the bbc 's michael voss in havana says remittances from cuban-americans will provide an important lifeline in a country where the average salary is about $ 20 a month .

cuban-americans will be allowed to travel to the island once a year and send more money to relatives there .
curbs on sending medicines and food have also been eased .
the measures were part of a $ 410bn bill to fund us government operations .
the legislation was approved by the senate after clearing the house of representatives last month .
the bill was supported by two cuban-american senators who had initially opposed it .
they changed their votes after receiving assurances from the obama administration that the changes did not amount to a major reversal of the 47-year-old us trade embargo on cuba .
lifeline the legislation overturns rules imposed by the bush administration which limited travel to just two weeks every three years , and confined visits to immediate family members .
president obama - who needs to sign the bill - has said he supports it .
he has also indicated that he would be open to dialogue with cuba 's leaders .
but he has said that like previous american presidents , he will only consider a full lifting of the embargo once cuba 's communist government makes significant moves such as the holding of democratic elections .
cuba 's president raul castro has said he is prepared to negotiate with the new us administration , providing there are no preconditions .
the bbc 's michael voss in havana says remittances from cuban-americans will provide an important lifeline in a country where the average salary is about $ 20 a month .

advertisement an animated anti-knife crime rap aimed at teenagers is being sent to mobile phones by south wales police a police force has turned to the latest digital technology in its fight to reduce knife crime .
south wales police has created a cartoon character , robby bluetooth , as a warning against carrying a blade .
a minute-long animation , to a rap track by a young local musician , is to be sent by bluetooth to phones by officers on patrol on the streets of cardiff .
meanwhile , the home office has announced an extra £ 5m for its knife crime crackdown .
the south wales force is one of 10 in england and wales taking part in the tackling knives action programme -lrb- tkap -rrb- .
bluetooth allows us to deliver messages like this - good quality content - and for me content that is portable , one person may pick it up and pass it on .
andrew mccarthy a month-long amnesty before christmas saw more than 700 knives and weapons handed in at police stations across the south wales police area .
to drive home the message , it has drafted in its latest - and arguably coolest - recruit , robby bluetooth .
robby has been developed over the past 18 months by andrew mccarthy of the force 's neighbourhood policing team for cardiff central and cardiff bay .
he has drawn up the storyboards for his adventures and recruited a young musician through grassroots , a youth project in cardiff city centre , to provide the backtrack .
he said he hoped that with young people 's input on the quality of robby 's look and sound , the youngster 's adventures would take on aspects of internet viral marketing .
robby bluetooth learns that carrying a knife is not the right thing to do he said : " if you look at what most young people carry around , it is a mobile phone .
it 's the one piece of technology that every young person has now .
" bluetooth allows us to deliver messages like this - good quality content - and for me content that is portable , one person may pick it up and pass it on .
" i 'm hoping friends will go ' have you seen and heard the rap ? ' and people will start bluetoothing it to each other .
" hopefully robby will grow into a series and become an educational tool across the age range . "
the fight against knife crime is not robby 's first outing .
so far he has delivered a message about making premises safe to cardiff university students when they had a problem with burglaries and he took a -lrb- virtual -rrb- walk around cardiff city centre telling people about car crime and protecting their purchases in the new year sales .
before halloween and bonfire night last year , he also delivered a message about anti-social behaviour .
the bluetooth message is delivered automatically by officers on street patrol using a machine that can be carried in a backpack .
mr mccarthy said the machine did not keep the number of the phone that received the bluetooth message and people could refuse to accept the message .
on continued funding for tkap , south wales police 's assistant chief constable david morris said it had already brought " huge benefits " in developing policies .
" through a blend of education , engagement and enforcement techniques , we are determined to continue to develop these sustainable methods to reassure our communities and keep south wales safe . "

south wales police has created a cartoon character , robby bluetooth , as a warning against carrying a blade .
a minute-long animation , to a rap track by a young local musician , is to be sent by bluetooth to phones by officers on patrol on the streets of cardiff .
meanwhile , the home office has announced an extra £ 5m for its knife crime crackdown .
the south wales force is one of 10 in england and wales taking part in the tackling knives action programme -lrb- tkap -rrb- .
bluetooth allows us to deliver messages like this - good quality content - and for me content that is portable , one person may pick it up and pass it on .
andrew mccarthy a month-long amnesty before christmas saw more than 700 knives and weapons handed in at police stations across the south wales police area .
to drive home the message , it has drafted in its latest - and arguably coolest - recruit , robby bluetooth .
robby has been developed over the past 18 months by andrew mccarthy of the force 's neighbourhood policing team for cardiff central and cardiff bay .
he has drawn up the storyboards for his adventures and recruited a young musician through grassroots , a youth project in cardiff city centre , to provide the backtrack .
he said he hoped that with young people 's input on the quality of robby 's look and sound , the youngster 's adventures would take on aspects of internet viral marketing .
robby bluetooth learns that carrying a knife is not the right thing to do he said : " if you look at what most young people carry around , it is a mobile phone .
it 's the one piece of technology that every young person has now .
" bluetooth allows us to deliver messages like this - good quality content - and for me content that is portable , one person may pick it up and pass it on .
" i 'm hoping friends will go ' have you seen and heard the rap ? ' and people will start bluetoothing it to each other .
" hopefully robby will grow into a series and become an educational tool across the age range . "
the fight against knife crime is not robby 's first outing .
so far he has delivered a message about making premises safe to cardiff university students when they had a problem with burglaries and he took a -lrb- virtual -rrb- walk around cardiff city centre telling people about car crime and protecting their purchases in the new year sales .
before halloween and bonfire night last year , he also delivered a message about anti-social behaviour .
the bluetooth message is delivered automatically by officers on street patrol using a machine that can be carried in a backpack .
mr mccarthy said the machine did not keep the number of the phone that received the bluetooth message and people could refuse to accept the message .
on continued funding for tkap , south wales police 's assistant chief constable david morris said it had already brought " huge benefits " in developing policies .
" through a blend of education , engagement and enforcement techniques , we are determined to continue to develop these sustainable methods to reassure our communities and keep south wales safe . "

advertisement rory cellan-jones reports on the winners and losers at the video game baftas , where call of duty 4 and super mario galaxy came out top .
call of duty 4 took three awards at the 2009 british academy of film and television arts video game ceremony .
the surprise winner of game of the year , the biggest award , was super mario galaxy .
more surprising was the fact that best-selling title gta iv went home without any awards - despite being nominated in seven separate categories .

it won best use of audio and best original score .
the shock of the ceremony was super mario galaxy being picked as game of the year .
british game makers were represented with codemasters and lionhead getting awards for their work on race driver : grid and fable ii respectively .
film director steven spielberg won an award for his work on casual game boom blox for the nintendo wii .
the video game baftas are given out to recognise " the very best in artistic , creative and technical innovation in video games " .

bafta has been giving out awards to the games industry since 1998 , although it only became a separate event in 2004 .
39 different games were nominated for an award and the event was hosted by mock the week compere and stand-up comedian dara o 'briain , an avid gamer himself who describes his playing habits as " midway between hardcore and casual " .
the academy also bestowed a fellowship award on nolan bushnell , founder of atari and the man who created the first ever mass-market video game , pong .
the last awards event , in 2007 , caused controversy as some of the nominated titles had not actually been released in the shops and , in some cases , were not even finished .
as a result the 2008 ceremony was delayed until march 2009 to avoid clashing with the golden joysticks and to give judges more time with the nominated games .

the authority is awaiting an inspection by wales auditor general jeremy colman .
a spokesperson for anglesey council said it was expecting to learn further details of the inspection timetable later this week .
no date for the special council meeting has been set .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- obama diary : the first 100 days bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 07:56 gmt , wednesday , 11 march 2009 obama diary : the first 100 days barack obama was elected on a message of change .
now he is in office , change is expected both in foreign and domestic policy .
here the bbc 's team in washington tracks developments in the first 100 days of the obama presidency .
tuesday 10 march - day 50 2200 est cuba policy review sarah morris : it must be one of the longest trade embargoes in history .
for more than half a century the us has held the castro regime in cuba at arm 's length .
but now there are signs - very small ones - of a loosening up .
the senate has just voted to approve two clauses of the spending bill , one which will allow cuban-americans to travel to their homeland every year instead of once every three years and another which will make it possible for a small , select group of us businesses to go to the island to market and sell agricultural and medical equipment .
president obama and other administration members feel that after 50 years , and fidel castro 's retirement , it 's time to review us policy towards the cuban government .
however , we 're unlikely to see planeloads of us holidaymakers bound for sandy cuban beaches and the urban delights of havana anytime soon .
mr obama has made it clear that the trade embargo should stay firmly in place without evidence of democratic reforms .
as for the new bits of legislation on the books tonight - they did n't go through without a fight .
senators from states with large populations of anti-communist cuban-americans were less than happy .
two of them - new jersey 's robert menendez and florida 's bill nelson , both democrats , only agreed to vote in favour -lrb- and thus ensure the legislation got passed -rrb- after receiving reassuring letters from treasury secretary timothy geithner .
1700 est backpedalling on china ?
kim ghattas : china 's foreign minister , yang jiechi , arrives in dc today and will hold talks on wednesday with hillary clinton , and treasury secretary timothy geithner .
there will be lots to talk about , from the continuing economic crisis to climate change as well as rising tensions after the incident at sea .
it 's also likely that tibet will come up .
it 's not clear what clinton will tell yang or how tough she 'll sound .
the dalai lama certainly sounded fierce today when he said his people had been " put through hell " .
he was speaking on the 50th anniversary of the tibetan uprising .
during her asia trip , hillary clinton said that while human rights would remain on the agenda in talks with the chinese , it should not interfere with attempts to cooperate with them on other issues , like climate change and the economy .
this has led to criticism and accusations of backpedalling on human rights in her talks with the chinese , but also with the egyptians , turks and others .
a state department spokesperson said the criticism was unfair because mrs clinton had devoted a lot of her career to human rights and would continue to do so , but she also understood the limitations of what could be achieved by raising the issue during official meetings , so she had tasked her staff to come up with new , creative ways to influence the situation .
it 's slightly unfortunate though that the chinese foreign minister arrives in dc precisely on the day of anniversary of the tibetan uprising ...
1520 est battle is joined max deveson : the introduction of the employee free choice act -lrb- efca -rrb- is the first shot in what could prove to be one of this year 's most bruising congressional fights .
efca is the american trade union movement 's biggest legislative priority , but it is vehemently opposed by big business .
the act would make it easier for unions to organise - workers would indicate their preference for a union to be recognised by their employers by signing an authorisation card -lrb- the measure is also known as " card check " -rrb- .
employers say efca would do away with the secret ballot , and could lead to union coercion .
the unions say the deck is already stacked in the employers ' favour , and that under the terms of the act workers would be free to hold secret ballots if a third of workers in the firm demand it .
president obama supports the measure , and the house of representatives is also likely to pass the bill .
but the real battle will be in the senate ; if moderates from both parties baulk at it , the bill will not pass .
if recent comments from arkansas democrat blanche lincoln - " the bill is divisive and we do n't need that right now " - are any indication of moderates ' thinking , the bill is going to encounter some difficulties .
1200 est halfway there kevin connolly : as president obama reaches the half-way point of his first 100 days , i took a look at the eventful first 50 days .
read kevin connolly 's analysis of president obama 's first 50 days monday 9 march - day 49 1804 est another bush policy reversed jonathan beale : as expected , president obama has announced his decision to overturn his predecessor 's ban on federal funding for new stem cell research .
as i point out in this article , the ruling is one of a growing number of changes that the new president has made to george w bush 's policy legacy .
sunday 8 march - day 48 1830 est back from her travels kim ghattas : the overall theme of hillary clinton 's second trip abroad was further outreach and more public diplomacy .
in the middle east , she attracted smaller crowds overall than during her asia trip but she was still immensely popular and often got effusive applause .
the outreach was meant for both foes and allies .
she tried to rekindle strained ties with europe and turkey , she worked to thaw relations with russia but crucially , in a clear break with the bush administration , she reached out , in public to iran and syria .
she invited tehran to attend a conference on afghanistan later this month .
the iranians have said they will attend .
and she sent two senior envoys to damascus , which has had icy ties with washington for almost five years .
will engagement yield results ?
it 's still too early to tell .
but hillary clinton 's strategy is this , in her own words : " something positive might actually happen .
you never know .
but if you stand at opposite sides of the room and refuse to engage , it 's guaranteed nothing will happen . "
friday 6 march - day 46 1734 est stem cell ruling max deveson : president obama is to lift the ban on federal funding for research on new stem cell lines , according to reports .
the move is a campaign pledge , but will be no less controversial for that .
read the bbc 's north america editor justin webb 's take on the story .
1306 est empty treasury ?
kevin connolly : treasury secretary timothy geithner seems to be finding it harder to swear in deputies than gary cooper on the eve of his gun battle with the bad guys in " high noon " .
senators conducting a hearing into the aig insurance group asked for a representative from the treasury to appear and were told no-one was available .
and two of mr geithner 's nominations for senior positions - annette nazareth and caroline atkinson - are said to have withdrawn from the process , although there 's no suggestion that either of them has failed to pay their taxes or is in any other way disqualified from government service .
ms nazareth once worked at the securities and exchange commission and may have been worried that some might have held her partly responsible for the lax financial oversight which helped set the stage for the current crisis .
but is n't it possible that having had its fingers burned with so many appointments in one way or another the administration is responding by making the vetting process so onerous that high-flyers are put off the idea of government service ?
thursday 5 march - day 45 1730 est the road to iran runs through russia kim ghattas : at the nato meeting in brussels today , washington and its partners announced the resumption of high-level ties with moscow .
secretary of state hillary clinton spoke of a great potential for co-operation with russia on a range of issues , including afghanistan and iran .
the us is hoping moscow will help secure new and safer supply lines for nato troops in afghanistan .
but the thaw is also part of a carefully orchestrated and very cautious dance by washington to engage iran and curb its nuclear plans .
russia 's help will be crucial .
mrs clinton called for an international meeting on afghanistan later this month , under un auspices , and said iran would be invited .
it is the first public overture to tehran by the obama administration .
iran has not yet responded , so we do not yet know whether president barack obama will find that " unclenched fist " that he is hoping for , but his administration and his secretary of state are keeping a realistic , pragmatic attitude .
mrs clinton will meet her russian counterpart , sergei lavrov , in geneva on friday .
iran will be high on the agenda and the secretary of state will be hoping that today 's developments in brussels will pave the way for a positive meeting .
1719 est healthy democracy ?
max deveson : president obama presided over a healthcare summit today , where he reiterated that he was not wedded to any specific plan for health reform - he just wanted " to figure out what works " .
present at the meeting were dozens of congressmen , as well as representatives of doctors , patients , insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms .
the event is part of mr obama 's strategy to get a healthcare reform bill through congress by the end of the year .
it 's at meetings like this where the details of the reform package will be hammered out - mr obama hopes to get all of the stakeholders on board to ease the passage of the legislation .
1158 est grey matter rajini vaidyanathan : is all the stress of being president going to barack obama 's head , quite literally ?
several news websites have noted that the president 's hair has been getting as white as his house .
during the campaign , a theory was doing the rounds that president obama had been grey for sometime , but at the start of the campaign had started dying his hair .
his barber dismissed the suggestion , however .
whatever the truth of the matter , these days mr obama seems quite content to acknowledge his changing hair colour a few months ago he told a campaign rally that the " the grey is coming quick , " and " by the time i 'm sworn in , i will look the part . "
perhaps those who are splitting hairs -lrb- excuse the pun -rrb- , about the president 's more distinguished look should relax .
if he 's happy , then what 's the big deal ?
wednesday 4 march - day 44 1709 est what america has been focusing on max deveson : although gordon brown 's us visit has been the main focus of the british media today , america 's attention been directed more towards president obama 's call to cut the amount of money government spends on outside contractors .
mr obama has also been challenged to a debate by conservative talk radio host rush limbaugh .
mr limbaugh 's star has been in the ascendant of late , as i noted in a piece on the current state of the republican party .
tuesday 3 march - day 43 1700 est good and bad news kevin connolly : yesterday we learned that the us savings rate hit 5 % in january -lrb- which means that americans banked five dollars out of every hundred dollars that they earned -rrb- .
in january last year , the rate was 0.1 % and even that was an improvement on 2005 when america as a whole actually spent more than it earned .
so far so good .
in the long run , a solid savings rate is a good thing .
but sometimes you have to read one set of statistics in conjunction with another .
consider this , for example .
in january , general motors ' sales fell by an eye-watering 53 % and neither ford nor toyota fared much better .
so saving , a good thing in the long run , can be destructive in the short-term because no spending means no sales and no sales means , in the end , no jobs .
have mr obama 's attempts to convey the severity of the recession panicked americans into cutting back so hard that their thriftiness is hurting the economy ? 1200 est russian overtures adam brookes : officials at the white house say that president obama has sent a letter to president medvedev of russia suggesting the us may be prepared to scale back plans for a missile defence system in europe if russia collaborates on iran policy .
we do n't know exactly what was in president obama 's letter to his russian counterpart , but it was delivered by hand a few weeks ago and officials at the white house say it covered all sorts of issues of contention between washington and moscow .
among them was the american plan to deploy missile defences in eastern europe , something the russians are very unhappy about .
the letter suggested that america might be prepared to put those plans on hold and in return the russians would be asked for greater cooperation on iran and on international efforts to limit the iranian missile and nuclear programmes .
it 's a trade-off that has been talked about for a while in washington .
missile defence is an expensive and so far relatively unreliable weapons programme and jettisoning it might allow the obama administration to take some of the stress out of us relations with russia , while getting valuable help on iran in return .
1145 est us envoys to syria kim ghattas : hillary clinton has announced that two us envoys will travel to damascus for talks - this is the obama administration 's clearest and biggest break on middle east policy with the bush administration so far .
relations between the us and syria have been icy for about five years and there 's been no ambassador in damascus since 2005 .
senior us officials tell me that jeffrey feltman and dan shapiro will be in damascus on saturday - they handle the middle east at state and at the national security council .
the talks were described by clinton as preliminary .
this is probably not going to be a cakewalk for the syrians .
feltman was ambassador to lebanon during the " cedar revolution " when thousands of lebanese demanded a syrian troop withdrawal in the aftermath of the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri .
syria claimed the pro-western camp in lebanon was being manipulated by feltman .
shapiro formerly worked for senator bill nelson and helped draft the syria accountability act of 2003 , which slapped further sanctions on damascus .
monday 2 march - day 42 1330 est sebelius at health max deveson : the speculation turned out to be correct .
kansas governor kathleen sebelius will be obama 's nominee for health and human services secretary , replacing the tax-challenged tom daschle .
but ms sebelius will have less control over the passage of healthcare reform than mr daschle would have done .
had he not withdrawn his name , he would have served as both health secretary and head of the white house office for health reform , but with mr daschle out of the picture , president obama is sharing the roles between two people - ms sebelius will run the department , while nancy-ann deparle will take up the white house post , with responsibility for pushing reform legislation through congress .
bill clinton 's healthcare reform efforts suffered because too many people were running the show - will obama 's plan endure a similar fate ? 1252 est ' the wrong hands ' kim ghattas : hillary clinton today sent a clear signal that the us position on hamas remained as tough as it was under bush and for years before that .
at the gaza aid donor conference in egypt , she said : " we have worked with the palestinian authority to install safeguards that will ensure that our funding ... does not end up in the wrong hands " - ie hamas .
the us and the other donors , including arab states , are keen that the $ 4.5bn pledged props up the palestinian authority and does not end up helping hamas rebuild its infrastructure or its popular support base in gaza .
the move has drawn some interesting reactions .
hamas , which was not invited to the conference , said that despite obama 's promise for change : " clinton is using the same language of the former bush and rice -lrb- administration -rrb- , and ... her recent statements about the conditions for reconstruction are ... not logical . "
asked whether he saw a major shift from the bush administration 's middle eastern policy , egypt 's foreign minister ahmad abulgheith said : " no , i do n't think so . "

now he is in office , change is expected both in foreign and domestic policy .
here the bbc 's team in washington tracks developments in the first 100 days of the obama presidency .
tuesday 10 march - day 50 2200 est cuba policy review sarah morris : it must be one of the longest trade embargoes in history .
for more than half a century the us has held the castro regime in cuba at arm 's length .
but now there are signs - very small ones - of a loosening up .
the senate has just voted to approve two clauses of the spending bill , one which will allow cuban-americans to travel to their homeland every year instead of once every three years and another which will make it possible for a small , select group of us businesses to go to the island to market and sell agricultural and medical equipment .
president obama and other administration members feel that after 50 years , and fidel castro 's retirement , it 's time to review us policy towards the cuban government .
however , we 're unlikely to see planeloads of us holidaymakers bound for sandy cuban beaches and the urban delights of havana anytime soon .
mr obama has made it clear that the trade embargo should stay firmly in place without evidence of democratic reforms .
as for the new bits of legislation on the books tonight - they did n't go through without a fight .
senators from states with large populations of anti-communist cuban-americans were less than happy .
two of them - new jersey 's robert menendez and florida 's bill nelson , both democrats , only agreed to vote in favour -lrb- and thus ensure the legislation got passed -rrb- after receiving reassuring letters from treasury secretary timothy geithner .
1700 est backpedalling on china ?
kim ghattas : china 's foreign minister , yang jiechi , arrives in dc today and will hold talks on wednesday with hillary clinton , and treasury secretary timothy geithner .
there will be lots to talk about , from the continuing economic crisis to climate change as well as rising tensions after the incident at sea .
it 's also likely that tibet will come up .
it 's not clear what clinton will tell yang or how tough she 'll sound .
the dalai lama certainly sounded fierce today when he said his people had been " put through hell " .
he was speaking on the 50th anniversary of the tibetan uprising .
during her asia trip , hillary clinton said that while human rights would remain on the agenda in talks with the chinese , it should not interfere with attempts to cooperate with them on other issues , like climate change and the economy .
this has led to criticism and accusations of backpedalling on human rights in her talks with the chinese , but also with the egyptians , turks and others .
a state department spokesperson said the criticism was unfair because mrs clinton had devoted a lot of her career to human rights and would continue to do so , but she also understood the limitations of what could be achieved by raising the issue during official meetings , so she had tasked her staff to come up with new , creative ways to influence the situation .
it 's slightly unfortunate though that the chinese foreign minister arrives in dc precisely on the day of anniversary of the tibetan uprising ...
1520 est battle is joined max deveson : the introduction of the employee free choice act -lrb- efca -rrb- is the first shot in what could prove to be one of this year 's most bruising congressional fights .
efca is the american trade union movement 's biggest legislative priority , but it is vehemently opposed by big business .
the act would make it easier for unions to organise - workers would indicate their preference for a union to be recognised by their employers by signing an authorisation card -lrb- the measure is also known as " card check " -rrb- .
employers say efca would do away with the secret ballot , and could lead to union coercion .
the unions say the deck is already stacked in the employers ' favour , and that under the terms of the act workers would be free to hold secret ballots if a third of workers in the firm demand it .
president obama supports the measure , and the house of representatives is also likely to pass the bill .
but the real battle will be in the senate ; if moderates from both parties baulk at it , the bill will not pass .
if recent comments from arkansas democrat blanche lincoln - " the bill is divisive and we do n't need that right now " - are any indication of moderates ' thinking , the bill is going to encounter some difficulties .
1200 est halfway there kevin connolly : as president obama reaches the half-way point of his first 100 days , i took a look at the eventful first 50 days .
read kevin connolly 's analysis of president obama 's first 50 days monday 9 march - day 49 1804 est another bush policy reversed jonathan beale : as expected , president obama has announced his decision to overturn his predecessor 's ban on federal funding for new stem cell research .
as i point out in this article , the ruling is one of a growing number of changes that the new president has made to george w bush 's policy legacy .
sunday 8 march - day 48 1830 est back from her travels kim ghattas : the overall theme of hillary clinton 's second trip abroad was further outreach and more public diplomacy .
in the middle east , she attracted smaller crowds overall than during her asia trip but she was still immensely popular and often got effusive applause .
the outreach was meant for both foes and allies .
she tried to rekindle strained ties with europe and turkey , she worked to thaw relations with russia but crucially , in a clear break with the bush administration , she reached out , in public to iran and syria .
she invited tehran to attend a conference on afghanistan later this month .
the iranians have said they will attend .
and she sent two senior envoys to damascus , which has had icy ties with washington for almost five years .
will engagement yield results ?
it 's still too early to tell .
but hillary clinton 's strategy is this , in her own words : " something positive might actually happen .
you never know .
but if you stand at opposite sides of the room and refuse to engage , it 's guaranteed nothing will happen . "
friday 6 march - day 46 1734 est stem cell ruling max deveson : president obama is to lift the ban on federal funding for research on new stem cell lines , according to reports .
the move is a campaign pledge , but will be no less controversial for that .
read the bbc 's north america editor justin webb 's take on the story .
1306 est empty treasury ?
kevin connolly : treasury secretary timothy geithner seems to be finding it harder to swear in deputies than gary cooper on the eve of his gun battle with the bad guys in " high noon " .
senators conducting a hearing into the aig insurance group asked for a representative from the treasury to appear and were told no-one was available .
and two of mr geithner 's nominations for senior positions - annette nazareth and caroline atkinson - are said to have withdrawn from the process , although there 's no suggestion that either of them has failed to pay their taxes or is in any other way disqualified from government service .
ms nazareth once worked at the securities and exchange commission and may have been worried that some might have held her partly responsible for the lax financial oversight which helped set the stage for the current crisis .
but is n't it possible that having had its fingers burned with so many appointments in one way or another the administration is responding by making the vetting process so onerous that high-flyers are put off the idea of government service ?
thursday 5 march - day 45 1730 est the road to iran runs through russia kim ghattas : at the nato meeting in brussels today , washington and its partners announced the resumption of high-level ties with moscow .
secretary of state hillary clinton spoke of a great potential for co-operation with russia on a range of issues , including afghanistan and iran .
the us is hoping moscow will help secure new and safer supply lines for nato troops in afghanistan .
but the thaw is also part of a carefully orchestrated and very cautious dance by washington to engage iran and curb its nuclear plans .
russia 's help will be crucial .
mrs clinton called for an international meeting on afghanistan later this month , under un auspices , and said iran would be invited .
it is the first public overture to tehran by the obama administration .
iran has not yet responded , so we do not yet know whether president barack obama will find that " unclenched fist " that he is hoping for , but his administration and his secretary of state are keeping a realistic , pragmatic attitude .
mrs clinton will meet her russian counterpart , sergei lavrov , in geneva on friday .
iran will be high on the agenda and the secretary of state will be hoping that today 's developments in brussels will pave the way for a positive meeting .
1719 est healthy democracy ?
max deveson : president obama presided over a healthcare summit today , where he reiterated that he was not wedded to any specific plan for health reform - he just wanted " to figure out what works " .
present at the meeting were dozens of congressmen , as well as representatives of doctors , patients , insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms .
the event is part of mr obama 's strategy to get a healthcare reform bill through congress by the end of the year .
it 's at meetings like this where the details of the reform package will be hammered out - mr obama hopes to get all of the stakeholders on board to ease the passage of the legislation .
1158 est grey matter rajini vaidyanathan : is all the stress of being president going to barack obama 's head , quite literally ?
several news websites have noted that the president 's hair has been getting as white as his house .
during the campaign , a theory was doing the rounds that president obama had been grey for sometime , but at the start of the campaign had started dying his hair .
his barber dismissed the suggestion , however .
whatever the truth of the matter , these days mr obama seems quite content to acknowledge his changing hair colour a few months ago he told a campaign rally that the " the grey is coming quick , " and " by the time i 'm sworn in , i will look the part . "
perhaps those who are splitting hairs -lrb- excuse the pun -rrb- , about the president 's more distinguished look should relax .
if he 's happy , then what 's the big deal ?
the burdens of office ? - barack obama -lrb- left -rrb- on 12 february 2009 and -lrb- right -rrb- on 19 september 2008 .
wednesday 4 march - day 44 1709 est what america has been focusing on max deveson : although gordon brown 's us visit has been the main focus of the british media today , america 's attention been directed more towards president obama 's call to cut the amount of money government spends on outside contractors .
mr obama has also been challenged to a debate by conservative talk radio host rush limbaugh .
mr limbaugh 's star has been in the ascendant of late , as i noted in a piece on the current state of the republican party .
tuesday 3 march - day 43 1700 est good and bad news kevin connolly : yesterday we learned that the us savings rate hit 5 % in january -lrb- which means that americans banked five dollars out of every hundred dollars that they earned -rrb- .
in january last year , the rate was 0.1 % and even that was an improvement on 2005 when america as a whole actually spent more than it earned .

and two of mr geithner 's nominations for senior positions - annette nazareth and caroline atkinson - are said to have withdrawn from the process , although there 's no suggestion that either of them has failed to pay their taxes or is in any other way disqualified from government service .
ms nazareth once worked at the securities and exchange commission and may have been worried that some might have held her partly responsible for the lax financial oversight which helped set the stage for the current crisis .
but is n't it possible that having had its fingers burned with so many appointments in one way or another the administration is responding by making the vetting process so onerous that high-flyers are put off the idea of government service ?
thursday 5 march - day 45 1730 est the road to iran runs through russia kim ghattas : at the nato meeting in brussels today , washington and its partners announced the resumption of high-level ties with moscow .
secretary of state hillary clinton spoke of a great potential for co-operation with russia on a range of issues , including afghanistan and iran .
the us is hoping moscow will help secure new and safer supply lines for nato troops in afghanistan .
but the thaw is also part of a carefully orchestrated and very cautious dance by washington to engage iran and curb its nuclear plans .
russia 's help will be crucial .
mrs clinton called for an international meeting on afghanistan later this month , under un auspices , and said iran would be invited .
it is the first public overture to tehran by the obama administration .
iran has not yet responded , so we do not yet know whether president barack obama will find that " unclenched fist " that he is hoping for , but his administration and his secretary of state are keeping a realistic , pragmatic attitude .
mrs clinton will meet her russian counterpart , sergei lavrov , in geneva on friday .
iran will be high on the agenda and the secretary of state will be hoping that today 's developments in brussels will pave the way for a positive meeting .
1719 est healthy democracy ?
max deveson : president obama presided over a healthcare summit today , where he reiterated that he was not wedded to any specific plan for health reform - he just wanted " to figure out what works " .
present at the meeting were dozens of congressmen , as well as representatives of doctors , patients , insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms .
the event is part of mr obama 's strategy to get a healthcare reform bill through congress by the end of the year .
it 's at meetings like this where the details of the reform package will be hammered out - mr obama hopes to get all of the stakeholders on board to ease the passage of the legislation .
1158 est grey matter rajini vaidyanathan : is all the stress of being president going to barack obama 's head , quite literally ?
several news websites have noted that the president 's hair has been getting as white as his house .
during the campaign , a theory was doing the rounds that president obama had been grey for sometime , but at the start of the campaign had started dying his hair .
his barber dismissed the suggestion , however .
whatever the truth of the matter , these days mr obama seems quite content to acknowledge his changing hair colour a few months ago he told a campaign rally that the " the grey is coming quick , " and " by the time i 'm sworn in , i will look the part . "
perhaps those who are splitting hairs -lrb- excuse the pun -rrb- , about the president 's more distinguished look should relax .
if he 's happy , then what 's the big deal ?
the burdens of office ? - barack obama -lrb- left -rrb- on 12 february 2009 and -lrb- right -rrb- on 19 september 2008 .
wednesday 4 march - day 44 1709 est what america has been focusing on max deveson : although gordon brown 's us visit has been the main focus of the british media today , america 's attention been directed more towards president obama 's call to cut the amount of money government spends on outside contractors .
mr obama has also been challenged to a debate by conservative talk radio host rush limbaugh .
mr limbaugh 's star has been in the ascendant of late , as i noted in a piece on the current state of the republican party .
tuesday 3 march - day 43 1700 est good and bad news kevin connolly : yesterday we learned that the us savings rate hit 5 % in january -lrb- which means that americans banked five dollars out of every hundred dollars that they earned -rrb- .
in january last year , the rate was 0.1 % and even that was an improvement on 2005 when america as a whole actually spent more than it earned .
so far so good .
in the long run , a solid savings rate is a good thing .
but sometimes you have to read one set of statistics in conjunction with another .
consider this , for example .
in january , general motors ' sales fell by an eye-watering 53 % and neither ford nor toyota fared much better .
so saving , a good thing in the long run , can be destructive in the short-term because no spending means no sales and no sales means , in the end , no jobs .
have mr obama 's attempts to convey the severity of the recession panicked americans into cutting back so hard that their thriftiness is hurting the economy ? 1200 est russian overtures adam brookes : officials at the white house say that president obama has sent a letter to president medvedev of russia suggesting the us may be prepared to scale back plans for a missile defence system in europe if russia collaborates on iran policy .
we do n't know exactly what was in president obama 's letter to his russian counterpart , but it was delivered by hand a few weeks ago and officials at the white house say it covered all sorts of issues of contention between washington and moscow .
among them was the american plan to deploy missile defences in eastern europe , something the russians are very unhappy about .
the letter suggested that america might be prepared to put those plans on hold and in return the russians would be asked for greater cooperation on iran and on international efforts to limit the iranian missile and nuclear programmes .
it 's a trade-off that has been talked about for a while in washington .
missile defence is an expensive and so far relatively unreliable weapons programme and jettisoning it might allow the obama administration to take some of the stress out of us relations with russia , while getting valuable help on iran in return .
1145 est us envoys to syria kim ghattas : hillary clinton has announced that two us envoys will travel to damascus for talks - this is the obama administration 's clearest and biggest break on middle east policy with the bush administration so far .
relations between the us and syria have been icy for about five years and there 's been no ambassador in damascus since 2005 .
senior us officials tell me that jeffrey feltman and dan shapiro will be in damascus on saturday - they handle the middle east at state and at the national security council .
the talks were described by clinton as preliminary .
this is probably not going to be a cakewalk for the syrians .
feltman was ambassador to lebanon during the " cedar revolution " when thousands of lebanese demanded a syrian troop withdrawal in the aftermath of the assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri .
syria claimed the pro-western camp in lebanon was being manipulated by feltman .
shapiro formerly worked for senator bill nelson and helped draft the syria accountability act of 2003 , which slapped further sanctions on damascus .
monday 2 march - day 42 1330 est sebelius at health max deveson : the speculation turned out to be correct .
kansas governor kathleen sebelius will be obama 's nominee for health and human services secretary , replacing the tax-challenged tom daschle .
but ms sebelius will have less control over the passage of healthcare reform than mr daschle would have done .
had he not withdrawn his name , he would have served as both health secretary and head of the white house office for health reform , but with mr daschle out of the picture , president obama is sharing the roles between two people - ms sebelius will run the department , while nancy-ann deparle will take up the white house post , with responsibility for pushing reform legislation through congress .
bill clinton 's healthcare reform efforts suffered because too many people were running the show - will obama 's plan endure a similar fate ? 1252 est ' the wrong hands ' kim ghattas : hillary clinton today sent a clear signal that the us position on hamas remained as tough as it was under bush and for years before that .
at the gaza aid donor conference in egypt , she said : " we have worked with the palestinian authority to install safeguards that will ensure that our funding ... does not end up in the wrong hands " - ie hamas .
the us and the other donors , including arab states , are keen that the $ 4.5bn pledged props up the palestinian authority and does not end up helping hamas rebuild its infrastructure or its popular support base in gaza .
the move has drawn some interesting reactions .
hamas , which was not invited to the conference , said that despite obama 's promise for change : " clinton is using the same language of the former bush and rice -lrb- administration -rrb- , and ... her recent statements about the conditions for reconstruction are ... not logical . "
asked whether he saw a major shift from the bush administration 's middle eastern policy , egypt 's foreign minister ahmad abulgheith said : " no , i do n't think so . "
