the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

between 15 and 20 neo-nazis are reported to have assaulted the occupants of two buses at the teufelsstahl rest stop on the a4 highway .
the attack on the some 80 labor union members , peace activists and members of the left party from the states of hesse and north rhine-westphalia occurred when they were on their way home from protesting a 6,000-strong neo-nazi march in dresden to commemorate the victims of the 1945 allied bombing raids on the eastern german city .
police have created a special working group to investigate the incident .
police too late on the scene ?
“ the neo-nazis attacked our two buses with the words ‘ attack anti-fascists , ' bottles and blocks of ice weighing several kilos , ” holger kindler , head of the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , which took part in the anti-fascist protest , told the ap news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent scuffles broke out between police and protesters in dresden over the weekend the chartered bus full of 41 neo-nazis left the rest stop by the time the police arrived on the scene .
but they were stopped further down the road while police took down their personal information .
on monday , the dpa news agency reported that police officials had no evidence yet that the swedish nationals on the coach were specifically to blame , but said they wanted to catch them before they left germany to go back to sweden .
“ it is inconceivable that the departure of these dangerous thugs could go unobserved by the police , ” bodo ramelow , deputy chairman of the left party , told dpa .
he demanded an investigation by the thuringia state parliament .
police said a similar attack on leftists at another highway stop near the city of chemnitz over the weekend by homebound neo-nazis left four persons slightly injured .

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 16.02.2009 government mulls new workplace privacy legislation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn spying scandal has prompted discussion top government , union and industry representatives are meeting on monday , feb .
16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .
public prosecutors are examining the data use to determine whether the company broke the law . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september .

ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
after years of declining birth rates , the country reached a low in 2006 , with 673,000 births .
that was 27 percent lower than in 1946 , when germany was just emerging from the devastation of world war two .
the turning point came in 2007 , when germany registered 685,000 births , 12,000 more than in the previous year .
the upward trend continued last year with around 690,000 births , according to a prognosis by the federal statistics office , an increase of 5,000 over 2007 .

" young people have the feeling that the society will not simply leave them behind as parents , " she said . von der leyen , herself a mother of seven , introduced a parental leave reform in 2007 which included new benefits for german fathers allowing them to stay at home for a time with their children .

however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .

16 , for authorities to split carmaker opel from its stricken us parent general motors to save it from being dragged into crisis . klaus franz , head of the opel works council , said in an interview with daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on monday that splitting opel from its struggling us parent general motors was the only way to secure the german carmaker 's future .
" we can not carry on like this with gm , the only prospect is disentanglement , " franz told the paper .
behnam yazdani , head of the youth wing of the social democrats in southern hesse , also pressed for a split .
" opel 's woes are n't homemade .
they have a name - general motors , " yazdani told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors , which has been overtaken by toyota as the world 's largest carmaker , is riddled with problems the comments come ahead of a tuesday deadline for general motors and chrysler , two of america 's three big carmakers , to submit restructuring plans to the obama administration in return for their multimillion-dollar bailout .
gm is cutting thousands of jobs and closing plants as the global economic downturn and slumping demand for cars hits what was once the world 's largest carmaker .
gm is reported to urgently need $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- in new funds to stay afloat .
gm europe fears for future gm subsidiaries in europe , which are struggling with sluggish demand themselves , are fearful of the knock-on effects and potentially fatal cost-cutting .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
on monday , european labor leaders called for splitting the opel / vauxhall from gm brand rather than face being dragged down with its us parent .
" the spin-off of opel / vauxhall … .and the spin-off of -lrb- swedish brand -rrb- saab is the only reasonable and feasible option for general motors which would not destroy the european operations and its european assets and could avoid lawsuits , " a statement on gm europe 's labor force web site said .
berlin pressed to take action in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , opel management , unions and local politicians have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs .
on monday , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung said german state governments could buy a stake in opel to save the carmaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel fears gm 's restructuring plans could lead to job losses in germany one option would be for the states of north rhine westphalia , hesse and thuringia - in which opel has factories - to take a share in the company as the state of lower saxony did in taking on 20 percent of volkswagen , the paper reported .
but some officials have suggested another tack .
the state premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , recently suggested a german-wide fund which could take a share in companies with key significance for the economy during emergencies , the paper said .
rüttgers is visiting the us this week and is scheduled to meet with gm officials in detroit on wednesday .
separately , german federal and regional government leaders are pressing the white house to extend any us federal aid to european units of gm and ford .
chancellor angela merkel said at the weekend she was waiting for gm to submit its north american restructuring plan before deciding on any rescue plan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trend was reversed in 2007 and continued in 2008 , family minister ursula von der leyen confirmed in a newspaper interview on sunday , feb .
15 . the family minister , who will present a report on families on monday , said the rise in the number of children was especially pronounced in women between 30 and 40 years of age .
men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
after years of declining birth rates , the country reached a low in 2006 , with 673,000 births .
that was 27 percent lower than in 1946 , when germany was just emerging from the devastation of world war two .
the turning point came in 2007 , when germany registered 685,000 births , 12,000 more than in the previous year .
the upward trend continued last year with around 690,000 births , according to a prognosis by the federal statistics office , an increase of 5,000 over 2007 .
new thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen said the reason behind the continuing rise in birth rates was a change in mentality .
" young people have the feeling that the society will not simply leave them behind as parents , " she said . von der leyen , herself a mother of seven , introduced a parental leave reform in 2007 which included new benefits for german fathers allowing them to stay at home for a time with their children .
the minister said her goal had been to lower the hurdles couples felt about having children .
according to surveys , 56 percent of stay-at-home mothers would like to work .
" but not at any price , " said von der leyen .
" they want good child care and part-time work .
we have to meet these mothers halfway . "
one survey carried out by the report found that 50 percent of those asked said the family policies of the current government had improved the situation for families .
around one-third said the situation had not changed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trend was reversed in 2007 and continued in 2008 , family minister ursula von der leyen confirmed in a newspaper interview on sunday , feb .

men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
after years of declining birth rates , the country reached a low in 2006 , with 673,000 births .
that was 27 percent lower than in 1946 , when germany was just emerging from the devastation of world war two .
the turning point came in 2007 , when germany registered 685,000 births , 12,000 more than in the previous year .

the minister said her goal had been to lower the hurdles couples felt about having children .
according to surveys , 56 percent of stay-at-home mothers would like to work .
" but not at any price , " said von der leyen .
" they want good child care and part-time work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .

continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .

the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.02.2009 berlin calms polish concerns over planned expellee center großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles are concerned the berlin center will paper over atrocities committed by the nazis germany and poland averted a row over a controversial museum that is to depict expellee experiences , with a polish envoy saying he was confident he could trust german chancellor angela merkel . wladyslaw bartoszewski , poland 's special representative for relations with germany , met in berlin with merkel on monday , feb .
16 .
there was no news conference , but he told polish reporters later he was " fully calmed and satisfied . " tension had earlier flared after polish diplomats reportedly heard that association of expellees president erika steinbach , 65 , would be appointed to the board of the planned berlin center , which is to depict how ethnic germans had to flee many nations after world war ii . many poles perceive the center as having an anti-polish agenda .
steinbach herself is viewed with revulsion by many poles because of her advocacy for ethnic germans expelled from polish soil between 1945 and 1947 .
steinbach is also a member of the german parliament for merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . not rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it will not forget the suffering that nazis unleashed ulrich wilhelm , the german government spokesman , said at a news conference , " the friendship , the partnership with poland is a very important objective for the federal government . "
he added that this had " a very high value . " wilhelm said the federally funded memorial would not attempt to reinterpret the history of world war ii and its aftermath .
he said germany admitted it was to blame for starting the war and all its consequences . he added that germany 's 1939 attack on poland , the start of the war , had " plunged europe into unfathomable suffering . " wilhelm said procedures to select the center 's board had not even begun .
a state minister , bernd neumann , who is a merkel aide , would meet with relevant organizations to hear their nominations .
germany 's cabinet would then select the members . the association of expellees decided in april 2008 to nominate steinbach to serve on the museum 's board and continues to stand by that decision , the group 's spokesman walter stratmann told the associated press on monday . sources added that the german government might postpone the issue , meaning the board could not be formed this year . steinbach under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of poland 's anger has been directed at steinbach poles have been outraged at steinbach 's criticism of their nation and her focus on the suffering of germans rather than victims of the nazis .
in the last few years , the expulsions have been the subject of a rash of german tv dramas . bartoszewski reportedly said sunday that poland would boycott some events with germany this year if steinbach were placed on the board . markus meckel , a foreign policy expert for the social democratic party , which rules in a grand coalition with merkel 's cdu , said steinbach should not be elected to the center 's board . " i assume foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will be clearly against accepting ms. steinbach when the cabinet meets , " he was quoted as saying by the daily berliner zeitung 's tuesday edition . after a right-wing administration in poland fiercely opposed the berlin memorial , polish prime minister donald tusk agreed to advise germany on keeping the museum neutral .
he is set to meet with merkel on feb .

there was no news conference , but he told polish reporters later he was " fully calmed and satisfied . " tension had earlier flared after polish diplomats reportedly heard that association of expellees president erika steinbach , 65 , would be appointed to the board of the planned berlin center , which is to depict how ethnic germans had to flee many nations after world war ii . many poles perceive the center as having an anti-polish agenda .
steinbach herself is viewed with revulsion by many poles because of her advocacy for ethnic germans expelled from polish soil between 1945 and 1947 .

in the last few years , the expulsions have been the subject of a rash of german tv dramas . bartoszewski reportedly said sunday that poland would boycott some events with germany this year if steinbach were placed on the board . markus meckel , a foreign policy expert for the social democratic party , which rules in a grand coalition with merkel 's cdu , said steinbach should not be elected to the center 's board .

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .
reaching out to opel merkel said she would also see to it that us car manufacturer general motors ' european unit opel received help .
she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .
she added it would fall exclusively to the european union to scrutinize french president nicolas sarkozy 's insistence on funnelling state aid to french carmakers .
" it will all be looked at again in brussels and tested to see if it is a distortion of competition , " she said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .

the meeting came a day after karzai admitted that he had not spoken to obama since the new us president assumed office last month and said that ties between his and the us administration had been strained .
regarded once as a darling of the west , karzai enjoyed a favoured status during the administration of former us president george w. bush , holding twice-a-month teleconferences with bush .
" there is tension between us and the us government on issues of civilian casualties , arrests of afghans , nightly raids on homes and the casualties they cause , " karzai said in an interview with sir david frost on al-jazeera television on friday .

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .
pakistan 's lawless tribal regions are believed to harbor taliban and al-qaeda rebels who fled across the border after the 2001 us-led invasion of afghanistan .
us to focus anti-terrorism efforts on afghanistan us president barack obama last month named richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords , as his special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan and tasked him with implementing an integrated american strategy towards both countries .
president obama has called afghanistan the main front in the " war on terror " and plans to send a further 30,000 troops , doubling the us military contingent fighting a taliban-led insurgency alongside 50,000 nato troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .
it would be similar to that set up in the 1990s to handle talks on peace in former yugoslavia , the weekly said .
holbrooke holds talks with karzai holbrooke , who is currently visiting kabul , after a four-day trip to neighboring pakistan , met with afghan president hamid karzai on saturday evening to discuss strategies in the fight against terrorism .
siamak herawi , a presidential spokesman , earlier had said that coordination among the international troops in afghanistan and civilian casualties caused during nato 's anti-taliban operations would be discussed .
the meeting came a day after karzai admitted that he had not spoken to obama since the new us president assumed office last month and said that ties between his and the us administration had been strained .
regarded once as a darling of the west , karzai enjoyed a favoured status during the administration of former us president george w. bush , holding twice-a-month teleconferences with bush .
" there is tension between us and the us government on issues of civilian casualties , arrests of afghans , nightly raids on homes and the casualties they cause , " karzai said in an interview with sir david frost on al-jazeera television on friday .
germany under pressure to do more obama has called on european members - germany included - to boost their efforts in afghanistan , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .
" america will do more , " us vice-president joe biden recently told the munich security conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well . "
currently , germany has some 3,500 the number of troops in afghanistan as part of a 50,000-strong nato deployment helping the afghan government assert its authority .

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .

she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .
reaching out to opel merkel said she would also see to it that us car manufacturer general motors ' european unit opel received help .
she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .
she added it would fall exclusively to the european union to scrutinize french president nicolas sarkozy 's insistence on funnelling state aid to french carmakers .
" it will all be looked at again in brussels and tested to see if it is a distortion of competition , " she said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .
pakistan 's lawless tribal regions are believed to harbor taliban and al-qaeda rebels who fled across the border after the 2001 us-led invasion of afghanistan .
us to focus anti-terrorism efforts on afghanistan us president barack obama last month named richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords , as his special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan and tasked him with implementing an integrated american strategy towards both countries .
president obama has called afghanistan the main front in the " war on terror " and plans to send a further 30,000 troops , doubling the us military contingent fighting a taliban-led insurgency alongside 50,000 nato troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .
it would be similar to that set up in the 1990s to handle talks on peace in former yugoslavia , the weekly said .
holbrooke holds talks with karzai holbrooke , who is currently visiting kabul , after a four-day trip to neighboring pakistan , met with afghan president hamid karzai on saturday evening to discuss strategies in the fight against terrorism .

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .
pakistan 's lawless tribal regions are believed to harbor taliban and al-qaeda rebels who fled across the border after the 2001 us-led invasion of afghanistan .
us to focus anti-terrorism efforts on afghanistan us president barack obama last month named richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords , as his special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan and tasked him with implementing an integrated american strategy towards both countries .
president obama has called afghanistan the main front in the " war on terror " and plans to send a further 30,000 troops , doubling the us military contingent fighting a taliban-led insurgency alongside 50,000 nato troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .
pakistan 's lawless tribal regions are believed to harbor taliban and al-qaeda rebels who fled across the border after the 2001 us-led invasion of afghanistan .
us to focus anti-terrorism efforts on afghanistan us president barack obama last month named richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords , as his special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan and tasked him with implementing an integrated american strategy towards both countries .
president obama has called afghanistan the main front in the " war on terror " and plans to send a further 30,000 troops , doubling the us military contingent fighting a taliban-led insurgency alongside 50,000 nato troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .
it would be similar to that set up in the 1990s to handle talks on peace in former yugoslavia , the weekly said .
holbrooke holds talks with karzai holbrooke , who is currently visiting kabul , after a four-day trip to neighboring pakistan , met with afghan president hamid karzai on saturday evening to discuss strategies in the fight against terrorism .
siamak herawi , a presidential spokesman , earlier had said that coordination among the international troops in afghanistan and civilian casualties caused during nato 's anti-taliban operations would be discussed .
the meeting came a day after karzai admitted that he had not spoken to obama since the new us president assumed office last month and said that ties between his and the us administration had been strained .
regarded once as a darling of the west , karzai enjoyed a favoured status during the administration of former us president george w. bush , holding twice-a-month teleconferences with bush .
" there is tension between us and the us government on issues of civilian casualties , arrests of afghans , nightly raids on homes and the casualties they cause , " karzai said in an interview with sir david frost on al-jazeera television on friday .
germany under pressure to do more obama has called on european members - germany included - to boost their efforts in afghanistan , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .
" america will do more , " us vice-president joe biden recently told the munich security conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well . "
currently , germany has some 3,500 the number of troops in afghanistan as part of a 50,000-strong nato deployment helping the afghan government assert its authority .
the german public , however , is strongly opposed to the mission and the issue is set to be a hot topic of debate ahead of a general election next september . dw staff -lrb- sp / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trend was reversed in 2007 and continued in 2008 , family minister ursula von der leyen confirmed in a newspaper interview on sunday , feb .
15 . the family minister , who will present a report on families on monday , said the rise in the number of children was especially pronounced in women between 30 and 40 years of age .
men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
after years of declining birth rates , the country reached a low in 2006 , with 673,000 births .
that was 27 percent lower than in 1946 , when germany was just emerging from the devastation of world war two .
the turning point came in 2007 , when germany registered 685,000 births , 12,000 more than in the previous year .
the upward trend continued last year with around 690,000 births , according to a prognosis by the federal statistics office , an increase of 5,000 over 2007 .
new thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen said the reason behind the continuing rise in birth rates was a change in mentality .
" young people have the feeling that the society will not simply leave them behind as parents , " she said . von der leyen , herself a mother of seven , introduced a parental leave reform in 2007 which included new benefits for german fathers allowing them to stay at home for a time with their children .
the minister said her goal had been to lower the hurdles couples felt about having children .
according to surveys , 56 percent of stay-at-home mothers would like to work .
" but not at any price , " said von der leyen .
" they want good child care and part-time work .
we have to meet these mothers halfway . "
one survey carried out by the report found that 50 percent of those asked said the family policies of the current government had improved the situation for families .
around one-third said the situation had not changed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trend was reversed in 2007 and continued in 2008 , family minister ursula von der leyen confirmed in a newspaper interview on sunday , feb .
15 . the family minister , who will present a report on families on monday , said the rise in the number of children was especially pronounced in women between 30 and 40 years of age .
men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
after years of declining birth rates , the country reached a low in 2006 , with 673,000 births .
that was 27 percent lower than in 1946 , when germany was just emerging from the devastation of world war two .
the turning point came in 2007 , when germany registered 685,000 births , 12,000 more than in the previous year .
the upward trend continued last year with around 690,000 births , according to a prognosis by the federal statistics office , an increase of 5,000 over 2007 .
new thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen said the reason behind the continuing rise in birth rates was a change in mentality .
" young people have the feeling that the society will not simply leave them behind as parents , " she said . von der leyen , herself a mother of seven , introduced a parental leave reform in 2007 which included new benefits for german fathers allowing them to stay at home for a time with their children .
the minister said her goal had been to lower the hurdles couples felt about having children .
according to surveys , 56 percent of stay-at-home mothers would like to work .
" but not at any price , " said von der leyen .
" they want good child care and part-time work .
we have to meet these mothers halfway . "
one survey carried out by the report found that 50 percent of those asked said the family policies of the current government had improved the situation for families .
around one-third said the situation had not changed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .
pakistan 's lawless tribal regions are believed to harbor taliban and al-qaeda rebels who fled across the border after the 2001 us-led invasion of afghanistan .
us to focus anti-terrorism efforts on afghanistan us president barack obama last month named richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords , as his special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan and tasked him with implementing an integrated american strategy towards both countries .
president obama has called afghanistan the main front in the " war on terror " and plans to send a further 30,000 troops , doubling the us military contingent fighting a taliban-led insurgency alongside 50,000 nato troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .

holbrooke holds talks with karzai holbrooke , who is currently visiting kabul , after a four-day trip to neighboring pakistan , met with afghan president hamid karzai on saturday evening to discuss strategies in the fight against terrorism .
siamak herawi , a presidential spokesman , earlier had said that coordination among the international troops in afghanistan and civilian casualties caused during nato 's anti-taliban operations would be discussed .
the meeting came a day after karzai admitted that he had not spoken to obama since the new us president assumed office last month and said that ties between his and the us administration had been strained .
regarded once as a darling of the west , karzai enjoyed a favoured status during the administration of former us president george w. bush , holding twice-a-month teleconferences with bush .
" there is tension between us and the us government on issues of civilian casualties , arrests of afghans , nightly raids on homes and the casualties they cause , " karzai said in an interview with sir david frost on al-jazeera television on friday .
germany under pressure to do more obama has called on european members - germany included - to boost their efforts in afghanistan , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 16.02.2009 opinion : clinton right to make asia her first destination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on monday , hillary clinton arrives in japan , the first stop of an asia tour and her first foreign trip as us secretary of state .
the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .

16 , for authorities to split carmaker opel from its stricken us parent general motors to save it from being dragged into crisis . klaus franz , head of the opel works council , said in an interview with daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on monday that splitting opel from its struggling us parent general motors was the only way to secure the german carmaker 's future .
" we can not carry on like this with gm , the only prospect is disentanglement , " franz told the paper .
behnam yazdani , head of the youth wing of the social democrats in southern hesse , also pressed for a split .
" opel 's woes are n't homemade .
they have a name - general motors , " yazdani told the paper .

gm is cutting thousands of jobs and closing plants as the global economic downturn and slumping demand for cars hits what was once the world 's largest carmaker .
gm is reported to urgently need $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- in new funds to stay afloat .
gm europe fears for future gm subsidiaries in europe , which are struggling with sluggish demand themselves , are fearful of the knock-on effects and potentially fatal cost-cutting .

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .
pakistan 's lawless tribal regions are believed to harbor taliban and al-qaeda rebels who fled across the border after the 2001 us-led invasion of afghanistan .
us to focus anti-terrorism efforts on afghanistan us president barack obama last month named richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords , as his special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan and tasked him with implementing an integrated american strategy towards both countries .
president obama has called afghanistan the main front in the " war on terror " and plans to send a further 30,000 troops , doubling the us military contingent fighting a taliban-led insurgency alongside 50,000 nato troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .
it would be similar to that set up in the 1990s to handle talks on peace in former yugoslavia , the weekly said .
holbrooke holds talks with karzai holbrooke , who is currently visiting kabul , after a four-day trip to neighboring pakistan , met with afghan president hamid karzai on saturday evening to discuss strategies in the fight against terrorism .
siamak herawi , a presidential spokesman , earlier had said that coordination among the international troops in afghanistan and civilian casualties caused during nato 's anti-taliban operations would be discussed .
the meeting came a day after karzai admitted that he had not spoken to obama since the new us president assumed office last month and said that ties between his and the us administration had been strained .
regarded once as a darling of the west , karzai enjoyed a favoured status during the administration of former us president george w. bush , holding twice-a-month teleconferences with bush .
" there is tension between us and the us government on issues of civilian casualties , arrests of afghans , nightly raids on homes and the casualties they cause , " karzai said in an interview with sir david frost on al-jazeera television on friday .
germany under pressure to do more obama has called on european members - germany included - to boost their efforts in afghanistan , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .
" america will do more , " us vice-president joe biden recently told the munich security conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well . "
currently , germany has some 3,500 the number of troops in afghanistan as part of a 50,000-strong nato deployment helping the afghan government assert its authority .
the german public , however , is strongly opposed to the mission and the issue is set to be a hot topic of debate ahead of a general election next september . dw staff -lrb- sp / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us to focus anti-terrorism efforts on afghanistan us president barack obama last month named richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords , as his special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan and tasked him with implementing an integrated american strategy towards both countries .
president obama has called afghanistan the main front in the " war on terror " and plans to send a further 30,000 troops , doubling the us military contingent fighting a taliban-led insurgency alongside 50,000 nato troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .
it would be similar to that set up in the 1990s to handle talks on peace in former yugoslavia , the weekly said .
holbrooke holds talks with karzai holbrooke , who is currently visiting kabul , after a four-day trip to neighboring pakistan , met with afghan president hamid karzai on saturday evening to discuss strategies in the fight against terrorism .
siamak herawi , a presidential spokesman , earlier had said that coordination among the international troops in afghanistan and civilian casualties caused during nato 's anti-taliban operations would be discussed .
the meeting came a day after karzai admitted that he had not spoken to obama since the new us president assumed office last month and said that ties between his and the us administration had been strained .
regarded once as a darling of the west , karzai enjoyed a favoured status during the administration of former us president george w. bush , holding twice-a-month teleconferences with bush .
" there is tension between us and the us government on issues of civilian casualties , arrests of afghans , nightly raids on homes and the casualties they cause , " karzai said in an interview with sir david frost on al-jazeera television on friday .
germany under pressure to do more obama has called on european members - germany included - to boost their efforts in afghanistan , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .
" america will do more , " us vice-president joe biden recently told the munich security conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well . "
currently , germany has some 3,500 the number of troops in afghanistan as part of a 50,000-strong nato deployment helping the afghan government assert its authority .
the german public , however , is strongly opposed to the mission and the issue is set to be a hot topic of debate ahead of a general election next september . dw staff -lrb- sp / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 16.02.2009 government mulls new workplace privacy legislation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn spying scandal has prompted discussion top government , union and industry representatives are meeting on monday , feb .
16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .
public prosecutors are examining the data use to determine whether the company broke the law . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 16.02.2009 opinion : clinton right to make asia her first destination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on monday , hillary clinton arrives in japan , the first stop of an asia tour and her first foreign trip as us secretary of state .
the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .

the trend was reversed in 2007 and continued in 2008 , family minister ursula von der leyen confirmed in a newspaper interview on sunday , feb .
15 . the family minister , who will present a report on families on monday , said the rise in the number of children was especially pronounced in women between 30 and 40 years of age .
men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
after years of declining birth rates , the country reached a low in 2006 , with 673,000 births .
that was 27 percent lower than in 1946 , when germany was just emerging from the devastation of world war two .
the turning point came in 2007 , when germany registered 685,000 births , 12,000 more than in the previous year .
the upward trend continued last year with around 690,000 births , according to a prognosis by the federal statistics office , an increase of 5,000 over 2007 .
new thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen said the reason behind the continuing rise in birth rates was a change in mentality .
" young people have the feeling that the society will not simply leave them behind as parents , " she said . von der leyen , herself a mother of seven , introduced a parental leave reform in 2007 which included new benefits for german fathers allowing them to stay at home for a time with their children .
the minister said her goal had been to lower the hurdles couples felt about having children .
according to surveys , 56 percent of stay-at-home mothers would like to work .
" but not at any price , " said von der leyen .
" they want good child care and part-time work .
we have to meet these mothers halfway . "
one survey carried out by the report found that 50 percent of those asked said the family policies of the current government had improved the situation for families .
around one-third said the situation had not changed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .
reaching out to opel merkel said she would also see to it that us car manufacturer general motors ' european unit opel received help .
she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .
she added it would fall exclusively to the european union to scrutinize french president nicolas sarkozy 's insistence on funnelling state aid to french carmakers .

on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september .

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .

that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.02.2009 berlin calms polish concerns over planned expellee center großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles are concerned the berlin center will paper over atrocities committed by the nazis germany and poland averted a row over a controversial museum that is to depict expellee experiences , with a polish envoy saying he was confident he could trust german chancellor angela merkel . wladyslaw bartoszewski , poland 's special representative for relations with germany , met in berlin with merkel on monday , feb .
16 .
there was no news conference , but he told polish reporters later he was " fully calmed and satisfied . " tension had earlier flared after polish diplomats reportedly heard that association of expellees president erika steinbach , 65 , would be appointed to the board of the planned berlin center , which is to depict how ethnic germans had to flee many nations after world war ii . many poles perceive the center as having an anti-polish agenda .
steinbach herself is viewed with revulsion by many poles because of her advocacy for ethnic germans expelled from polish soil between 1945 and 1947 .
steinbach is also a member of the german parliament for merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . not rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it will not forget the suffering that nazis unleashed ulrich wilhelm , the german government spokesman , said at a news conference , " the friendship , the partnership with poland is a very important objective for the federal government . "
he added that this had " a very high value . " wilhelm said the federally funded memorial would not attempt to reinterpret the history of world war ii and its aftermath .
he said germany admitted it was to blame for starting the war and all its consequences . he added that germany 's 1939 attack on poland , the start of the war , had " plunged europe into unfathomable suffering . " wilhelm said procedures to select the center 's board had not even begun .
a state minister , bernd neumann , who is a merkel aide , would meet with relevant organizations to hear their nominations .
germany 's cabinet would then select the members . the association of expellees decided in april 2008 to nominate steinbach to serve on the museum 's board and continues to stand by that decision , the group 's spokesman walter stratmann told the associated press on monday . sources added that the german government might postpone the issue , meaning the board could not be formed this year . steinbach under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of poland 's anger has been directed at steinbach poles have been outraged at steinbach 's criticism of their nation and her focus on the suffering of germans rather than victims of the nazis .
in the last few years , the expulsions have been the subject of a rash of german tv dramas . bartoszewski reportedly said sunday that poland would boycott some events with germany this year if steinbach were placed on the board . markus meckel , a foreign policy expert for the social democratic party , which rules in a grand coalition with merkel 's cdu , said steinbach should not be elected to the center 's board . " i assume foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will be clearly against accepting ms. steinbach when the cabinet meets , " he was quoted as saying by the daily berliner zeitung 's tuesday edition . after a right-wing administration in poland fiercely opposed the berlin memorial , polish prime minister donald tusk agreed to advise germany on keeping the museum neutral .
he is set to meet with merkel on feb .

16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .
pakistan 's lawless tribal regions are believed to harbor taliban and al-qaeda rebels who fled across the border after the 2001 us-led invasion of afghanistan .
us to focus anti-terrorism efforts on afghanistan us president barack obama last month named richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords , as his special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan and tasked him with implementing an integrated american strategy towards both countries .
president obama has called afghanistan the main front in the " war on terror " and plans to send a further 30,000 troops , doubling the us military contingent fighting a taliban-led insurgency alongside 50,000 nato troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .
it would be similar to that set up in the 1990s to handle talks on peace in former yugoslavia , the weekly said .
holbrooke holds talks with karzai holbrooke , who is currently visiting kabul , after a four-day trip to neighboring pakistan , met with afghan president hamid karzai on saturday evening to discuss strategies in the fight against terrorism .
siamak herawi , a presidential spokesman , earlier had said that coordination among the international troops in afghanistan and civilian casualties caused during nato 's anti-taliban operations would be discussed .
the meeting came a day after karzai admitted that he had not spoken to obama since the new us president assumed office last month and said that ties between his and the us administration had been strained .
regarded once as a darling of the west , karzai enjoyed a favoured status during the administration of former us president george w. bush , holding twice-a-month teleconferences with bush .
" there is tension between us and the us government on issues of civilian casualties , arrests of afghans , nightly raids on homes and the casualties they cause , " karzai said in an interview with sir david frost on al-jazeera television on friday .
germany under pressure to do more obama has called on european members - germany included - to boost their efforts in afghanistan , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .
" america will do more , " us vice-president joe biden recently told the munich security conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well . "
currently , germany has some 3,500 the number of troops in afghanistan as part of a 50,000-strong nato deployment helping the afghan government assert its authority .
the german public , however , is strongly opposed to the mission and the issue is set to be a hot topic of debate ahead of a general election next september . dw staff -lrb- sp / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .
it would be similar to that set up in the 1990s to handle talks on peace in former yugoslavia , the weekly said .
holbrooke holds talks with karzai holbrooke , who is currently visiting kabul , after a four-day trip to neighboring pakistan , met with afghan president hamid karzai on saturday evening to discuss strategies in the fight against terrorism .
siamak herawi , a presidential spokesman , earlier had said that coordination among the international troops in afghanistan and civilian casualties caused during nato 's anti-taliban operations would be discussed .
the meeting came a day after karzai admitted that he had not spoken to obama since the new us president assumed office last month and said that ties between his and the us administration had been strained .
regarded once as a darling of the west , karzai enjoyed a favoured status during the administration of former us president george w. bush , holding twice-a-month teleconferences with bush .
" there is tension between us and the us government on issues of civilian casualties , arrests of afghans , nightly raids on homes and the casualties they cause , " karzai said in an interview with sir david frost on al-jazeera television on friday .
germany under pressure to do more obama has called on european members - germany included - to boost their efforts in afghanistan , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .
" america will do more , " us vice-president joe biden recently told the munich security conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well . "
currently , germany has some 3,500 the number of troops in afghanistan as part of a 50,000-strong nato deployment helping the afghan government assert its authority .

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 16.02.2009 calls for constitutional change in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissidents in china want political reforms to accompany economic boom in china , despite censorship and intimidation , intellectuals are making louder calls for political reforms - often in the form of open letters to the government .
recently , the well-known author and editor ling cangzhou made an appeal for the end of one-party rule . ling cangzhou ’ s open letter is six pages long and his main demand is constitutional reform .
apart from the end of one-party rule , ling wants more protection for civil rights .
in his letter , he compares china to the former communist states of eastern europe , arguing that there is less potential for development in china because the economic boom is not accompanied by political reform .
“ china has an uncertain future ahead , ” ling told deutsche welle .
“ even the state media admit that social unrest is a huge problem .
we have simply concentrated too much on economic development and have neglected political reform . ”
close analysis of constitutional texts ling has closely analysed the texts of china ’ s constitutions over the past 100 years .
he concludes in the letter that china has taken several false turns on the path to democratisation .
although the 1946 constitution included the direct election of county heads , this was not part of the 1954 constitution of the people ’ s republic .
ling is especially critical of the fact that the rights , which the constitution supposedly guarantees - such as freedom of opinion and of the press - are not respected in reality .
generally , however , he thinks his appeal is mild : “ “ i am not a representative of the people but somebody should finally voice the wishes of the people so that there can be a public debate .
if a consensus is reached then there is always the hope it could end up being part of the legal agenda . ”
charter 08 calls for political reform fall on deaf ears last december , ling was one of the first signatories of “ charter 08 ” - a manifesto signed by over 300 intellectuals , lawyers and rights activists calling for reforms such as the division of powers , the direct election of mps and an independent judiciary .
beijing ’ s reaction was harsh and one of the main initiators , liu xiaobo , was arrested .
this attitude was recently reinforced by politburo member , jia qinglin , who said in a party newspaper report that china should not be misled by western ideas such as multi-party systems and the division of powers .
west provides models for constitutional reform but ling disagrees : “ many developed countries can serve as models for constitutional reform .
the us constitution , for example , or the german basic law etc .
in china , there is a saying : ‘ one can cross a river by stepping over stones .
but if there is already a solid bridge then why should one get one ’ s feet wet at all ? ”
last week , chinese officials defended china ’ s human rights record at the un human rights council , saying that there had been great achievements over the past 30 years in housing , education and provision of food .
the signatories of charter 08 and other dissidents , however , argue that political reforms are equally urgent . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- 16/02/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.02.2009 berlin calms polish concerns over planned expellee center großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles are concerned the berlin center will paper over atrocities committed by the nazis germany and poland averted a row over a controversial museum that is to depict expellee experiences , with a polish envoy saying he was confident he could trust german chancellor angela merkel . wladyslaw bartoszewski , poland 's special representative for relations with germany , met in berlin with merkel on monday , feb .
16 .
there was no news conference , but he told polish reporters later he was " fully calmed and satisfied . " tension had earlier flared after polish diplomats reportedly heard that association of expellees president erika steinbach , 65 , would be appointed to the board of the planned berlin center , which is to depict how ethnic germans had to flee many nations after world war ii . many poles perceive the center as having an anti-polish agenda .
steinbach herself is viewed with revulsion by many poles because of her advocacy for ethnic germans expelled from polish soil between 1945 and 1947 .
steinbach is also a member of the german parliament for merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . not rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it will not forget the suffering that nazis unleashed ulrich wilhelm , the german government spokesman , said at a news conference , " the friendship , the partnership with poland is a very important objective for the federal government . "
he added that this had " a very high value . " wilhelm said the federally funded memorial would not attempt to reinterpret the history of world war ii and its aftermath .
he said germany admitted it was to blame for starting the war and all its consequences . he added that germany 's 1939 attack on poland , the start of the war , had " plunged europe into unfathomable suffering . " wilhelm said procedures to select the center 's board had not even begun .
a state minister , bernd neumann , who is a merkel aide , would meet with relevant organizations to hear their nominations .
germany 's cabinet would then select the members . the association of expellees decided in april 2008 to nominate steinbach to serve on the museum 's board and continues to stand by that decision , the group 's spokesman walter stratmann told the associated press on monday . sources added that the german government might postpone the issue , meaning the board could not be formed this year . steinbach under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of poland 's anger has been directed at steinbach poles have been outraged at steinbach 's criticism of their nation and her focus on the suffering of germans rather than victims of the nazis .
in the last few years , the expulsions have been the subject of a rash of german tv dramas . bartoszewski reportedly said sunday that poland would boycott some events with germany this year if steinbach were placed on the board . markus meckel , a foreign policy expert for the social democratic party , which rules in a grand coalition with merkel 's cdu , said steinbach should not be elected to the center 's board . " i assume foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will be clearly against accepting ms. steinbach when the cabinet meets , " he was quoted as saying by the daily berliner zeitung 's tuesday edition . after a right-wing administration in poland fiercely opposed the berlin memorial , polish prime minister donald tusk agreed to advise germany on keeping the museum neutral .
he is set to meet with merkel on feb .

there was no news conference , but he told polish reporters later he was " fully calmed and satisfied .

steinbach herself is viewed with revulsion by many poles because of her advocacy for ethnic germans expelled from polish soil between 1945 and 1947 .

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .

she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .

16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .

16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .
reaching out to opel merkel said she would also see to it that us car manufacturer general motors ' european unit opel received help .
she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .

schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .

" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .

reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .

16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .
public prosecutors are examining the data use to determine whether the company broke the law . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .

that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

between 15 and 20 neo-nazis are reported to have assaulted the occupants of two buses at the teufelsstahl rest stop on the a4 highway .
the attack on the some 80 labor union members , peace activists and members of the left party from the states of hesse and north rhine-westphalia occurred when they were on their way home from protesting a 6,000-strong neo-nazi march in dresden to commemorate the victims of the 1945 allied bombing raids on the eastern german city .
police have created a special working group to investigate the incident .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 16.02.2009 opinion : clinton right to make asia her first destination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on monday , hillary clinton arrives in japan , the first stop of an asia tour and her first foreign trip as us secretary of state .
the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .

and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .

the trend was reversed in 2007 and continued in 2008 , family minister ursula von der leyen confirmed in a newspaper interview on sunday , feb .
15 . the family minister , who will present a report on families on monday , said the rise in the number of children was especially pronounced in women between 30 and 40 years of age .
men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
after years of declining birth rates , the country reached a low in 2006 , with 673,000 births .
that was 27 percent lower than in 1946 , when germany was just emerging from the devastation of world war two .
the turning point came in 2007 , when germany registered 685,000 births , 12,000 more than in the previous year .
the upward trend continued last year with around 690,000 births , according to a prognosis by the federal statistics office , an increase of 5,000 over 2007 .
new thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen said the reason behind the continuing rise in birth rates was a change in mentality .
" young people have the feeling that the society will not simply leave them behind as parents , " she said . von der leyen , herself a mother of seven , introduced a parental leave reform in 2007 which included new benefits for german fathers allowing them to stay at home for a time with their children .
the minister said her goal had been to lower the hurdles couples felt about having children .
according to surveys , 56 percent of stay-at-home mothers would like to work .
" but not at any price , " said von der leyen .
" they want good child care and part-time work .
we have to meet these mothers halfway . "
one survey carried out by the report found that 50 percent of those asked said the family policies of the current government had improved the situation for families .
around one-third said the situation had not changed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 16.02.2009 calls for constitutional change in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dissidents in china want political reforms to accompany economic boom in china , despite censorship and intimidation , intellectuals are making louder calls for political reforms - often in the form of open letters to the government .
recently , the well-known author and editor ling cangzhou made an appeal for the end of one-party rule . ling cangzhou ’ s open letter is six pages long and his main demand is constitutional reform .
apart from the end of one-party rule , ling wants more protection for civil rights .
in his letter , he compares china to the former communist states of eastern europe , arguing that there is less potential for development in china because the economic boom is not accompanied by political reform .
“ china has an uncertain future ahead , ” ling told deutsche welle .
“ even the state media admit that social unrest is a huge problem .
we have simply concentrated too much on economic development and have neglected political reform . ”
close analysis of constitutional texts ling has closely analysed the texts of china ’ s constitutions over the past 100 years .
he concludes in the letter that china has taken several false turns on the path to democratisation .
although the 1946 constitution included the direct election of county heads , this was not part of the 1954 constitution of the people ’ s republic .
ling is especially critical of the fact that the rights , which the constitution supposedly guarantees - such as freedom of opinion and of the press - are not respected in reality .
generally , however , he thinks his appeal is mild : “ “ i am not a representative of the people but somebody should finally voice the wishes of the people so that there can be a public debate .
if a consensus is reached then there is always the hope it could end up being part of the legal agenda . ”
charter 08 calls for political reform fall on deaf ears last december , ling was one of the first signatories of “ charter 08 ” - a manifesto signed by over 300 intellectuals , lawyers and rights activists calling for reforms such as the division of powers , the direct election of mps and an independent judiciary .
beijing ’ s reaction was harsh and one of the main initiators , liu xiaobo , was arrested .
this attitude was recently reinforced by politburo member , jia qinglin , who said in a party newspaper report that china should not be misled by western ideas such as multi-party systems and the division of powers .
west provides models for constitutional reform but ling disagrees : “ many developed countries can serve as models for constitutional reform .
the us constitution , for example , or the german basic law etc .

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .
pakistan 's lawless tribal regions are believed to harbor taliban and al-qaeda rebels who fled across the border after the 2001 us-led invasion of afghanistan .
us to focus anti-terrorism efforts on afghanistan us president barack obama last month named richard holbrooke , the architect of the dayton accords , as his special envoy to afghanistan and pakistan and tasked him with implementing an integrated american strategy towards both countries .
president obama has called afghanistan the main front in the " war on terror " and plans to send a further 30,000 troops , doubling the us military contingent fighting a taliban-led insurgency alongside 50,000 nato troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .
it would be similar to that set up in the 1990s to handle talks on peace in former yugoslavia , the weekly said .
holbrooke holds talks with karzai holbrooke , who is currently visiting kabul , after a four-day trip to neighboring pakistan , met with afghan president hamid karzai on saturday evening to discuss strategies in the fight against terrorism .
siamak herawi , a presidential spokesman , earlier had said that coordination among the international troops in afghanistan and civilian casualties caused during nato 's anti-taliban operations would be discussed .
the meeting came a day after karzai admitted that he had not spoken to obama since the new us president assumed office last month and said that ties between his and the us administration had been strained .
regarded once as a darling of the west , karzai enjoyed a favoured status during the administration of former us president george w. bush , holding twice-a-month teleconferences with bush .
" there is tension between us and the us government on issues of civilian casualties , arrests of afghans , nightly raids on homes and the casualties they cause , " karzai said in an interview with sir david frost on al-jazeera television on friday .
germany under pressure to do more obama has called on european members - germany included - to boost their efforts in afghanistan , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .
" america will do more , " us vice-president joe biden recently told the munich security conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well . "
currently , germany has some 3,500 the number of troops in afghanistan as part of a 50,000-strong nato deployment helping the afghan government assert its authority .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard holbrooke is the us envoy to pakistan and afghanistan earlier , german news magazine der spiegel reported that holbrooke was working to set up an interntional contact group for afghanistan .
it would be similar to that set up in the 1990s to handle talks on peace in former yugoslavia , the weekly said .
holbrooke holds talks with karzai holbrooke , who is currently visiting kabul , after a four-day trip to neighboring pakistan , met with afghan president hamid karzai on saturday evening to discuss strategies in the fight against terrorism .
siamak herawi , a presidential spokesman , earlier had said that coordination among the international troops in afghanistan and civilian casualties caused during nato 's anti-taliban operations would be discussed .
the meeting came a day after karzai admitted that he had not spoken to obama since the new us president assumed office last month and said that ties between his and the us administration had been strained .
regarded once as a darling of the west , karzai enjoyed a favoured status during the administration of former us president george w. bush , holding twice-a-month teleconferences with bush .
" there is tension between us and the us government on issues of civilian casualties , arrests of afghans , nightly raids on homes and the casualties they cause , " karzai said in an interview with sir david frost on al-jazeera television on friday .
germany under pressure to do more obama has called on european members - germany included - to boost their efforts in afghanistan , either by sending more men or by providing more support to the afghan government , army and police .
" america will do more , " us vice-president joe biden recently told the munich security conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask more from our partners as well . "
currently , germany has some 3,500 the number of troops in afghanistan as part of a 50,000-strong nato deployment helping the afghan government assert its authority .
the german public , however , is strongly opposed to the mission and the issue is set to be a hot topic of debate ahead of a general election next september . dw staff -lrb- sp / tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mützelburg 's appointment will " further intensify germany 's diplomatic engagement in afghanistan and pakistan , " the foreign ministry in berlin said in a statement .
germany follows the lead of the us and britain in naming a special emissary for afghanistan and neighboring pakistan , widely seen as key regions posing a serious challenge for western nations as they seek to combat global terrorism .
pakistan 's lawless tribal regions are believed to harbor taliban and al-qaeda rebels who fled across the border after the 2001 us-led invasion of afghanistan .

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trend was reversed in 2007 and continued in 2008 , family minister ursula von der leyen confirmed in a newspaper interview on sunday , feb .
15 . the family minister , who will present a report on families on monday , said the rise in the number of children was especially pronounced in women between 30 and 40 years of age .
men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
after years of declining birth rates , the country reached a low in 2006 , with 673,000 births .
that was 27 percent lower than in 1946 , when germany was just emerging from the devastation of world war two .
the turning point came in 2007 , when germany registered 685,000 births , 12,000 more than in the previous year .
the upward trend continued last year with around 690,000 births , according to a prognosis by the federal statistics office , an increase of 5,000 over 2007 .
new thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen said the reason behind the continuing rise in birth rates was a change in mentality .
" young people have the feeling that the society will not simply leave them behind as parents , " she said . von der leyen , herself a mother of seven , introduced a parental leave reform in 2007 which included new benefits for german fathers allowing them to stay at home for a time with their children .
the minister said her goal had been to lower the hurdles couples felt about having children .
according to surveys , 56 percent of stay-at-home mothers would like to work .
" but not at any price , " said von der leyen .
" they want good child care and part-time work .
we have to meet these mothers halfway . "
one survey carried out by the report found that 50 percent of those asked said the family policies of the current government had improved the situation for families .
around one-third said the situation had not changed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .
reaching out to opel merkel said she would also see to it that us car manufacturer general motors ' european unit opel received help .
she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .
she added it would fall exclusively to the european union to scrutinize french president nicolas sarkozy 's insistence on funnelling state aid to french carmakers .
" it will all be looked at again in brussels and tested to see if it is a distortion of competition , " she said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .

aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .

hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .

he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .
reaching out to opel merkel said she would also see to it that us car manufacturer general motors ' european unit opel received help .
she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .
she added it would fall exclusively to the european union to scrutinize french president nicolas sarkozy 's insistence on funnelling state aid to french carmakers .
" it will all be looked at again in brussels and tested to see if it is a distortion of competition , " she said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .

ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .

that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .

corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .

" conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .

that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there was no news conference , but he told polish reporters later he was " fully calmed and satisfied . " tension had earlier flared after polish diplomats reportedly heard that association of expellees president erika steinbach , 65 , would be appointed to the board of the planned berlin center , which is to depict how ethnic germans had to flee many nations after world war ii . many poles perceive the center as having an anti-polish agenda .
steinbach herself is viewed with revulsion by many poles because of her advocacy for ethnic germans expelled from polish soil between 1945 and 1947 .

a state minister , bernd neumann , who is a merkel aide , would meet with relevant organizations to hear their nominations .
germany 's cabinet would then select the members . the association of expellees decided in april 2008 to nominate steinbach to serve on the museum 's board and continues to stand by that decision , the group 's spokesman walter stratmann told the associated press on monday . sources added that the german government might postpone the issue , meaning the board could not be formed this year . steinbach under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of poland 's anger has been directed at steinbach poles have been outraged at steinbach 's criticism of their nation and her focus on the suffering of germans rather than victims of the nazis .

steinbach is also a member of the german parliament for merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . not rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it will not forget the suffering that nazis unleashed ulrich wilhelm , the german government spokesman , said at a news conference , " the friendship , the partnership with poland is a very important objective for the federal government . "
he added that this had " a very high value . " wilhelm said the federally funded memorial would not attempt to reinterpret the history of world war ii and its aftermath .
he said germany admitted it was to blame for starting the war and all its consequences . he added that germany 's 1939 attack on poland , the start of the war , had " plunged europe into unfathomable suffering . " wilhelm said procedures to select the center 's board had not even begun .
a state minister , bernd neumann , who is a merkel aide , would meet with relevant organizations to hear their nominations .
germany 's cabinet would then select the members . the association of expellees decided in april 2008 to nominate steinbach to serve on the museum 's board and continues to stand by that decision , the group 's spokesman walter stratmann told the associated press on monday . sources added that the german government might postpone the issue , meaning the board could not be formed this year . steinbach under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of poland 's anger has been directed at steinbach poles have been outraged at steinbach 's criticism of their nation and her focus on the suffering of germans rather than victims of the nazis .
in the last few years , the expulsions have been the subject of a rash of german tv dramas . bartoszewski reportedly said sunday that poland would boycott some events with germany this year if steinbach were placed on the board . markus meckel , a foreign policy expert for the social democratic party , which rules in a grand coalition with merkel 's cdu , said steinbach should not be elected to the center 's board . " i assume foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will be clearly against accepting ms. steinbach when the cabinet meets , " he was quoted as saying by the daily berliner zeitung 's tuesday edition . after a right-wing administration in poland fiercely opposed the berlin memorial , polish prime minister donald tusk agreed to advise germany on keeping the museum neutral .

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 16.02.2009 government mulls new workplace privacy legislation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn spying scandal has prompted discussion top government , union and industry representatives are meeting on monday , feb .
16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .
public prosecutors are examining the data use to determine whether the company broke the law . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , for authorities to split carmaker opel from its stricken us parent general motors to save it from being dragged into crisis . klaus franz , head of the opel works council , said in an interview with daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on monday that splitting opel from its struggling us parent general motors was the only way to secure the german carmaker 's future .
" we can not carry on like this with gm , the only prospect is disentanglement , " franz told the paper .
behnam yazdani , head of the youth wing of the social democrats in southern hesse , also pressed for a split .
" opel 's woes are n't homemade .
they have a name - general motors , " yazdani told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors , which has been overtaken by toyota as the world 's largest carmaker , is riddled with problems the comments come ahead of a tuesday deadline for general motors and chrysler , two of america 's three big carmakers , to submit restructuring plans to the obama administration in return for their multimillion-dollar bailout .
gm is cutting thousands of jobs and closing plants as the global economic downturn and slumping demand for cars hits what was once the world 's largest carmaker .
gm is reported to urgently need $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- in new funds to stay afloat .
gm europe fears for future gm subsidiaries in europe , which are struggling with sluggish demand themselves , are fearful of the knock-on effects and potentially fatal cost-cutting .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
on monday , european labor leaders called for splitting the opel / vauxhall from gm brand rather than face being dragged down with its us parent .
" the spin-off of opel / vauxhall … .and the spin-off of -lrb- swedish brand -rrb- saab is the only reasonable and feasible option for general motors which would not destroy the european operations and its european assets and could avoid lawsuits , " a statement on gm europe 's labor force web site said .
berlin pressed to take action in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , opel management , unions and local politicians have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs .
on monday , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung said german state governments could buy a stake in opel to save the carmaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel fears gm 's restructuring plans could lead to job losses in germany one option would be for the states of north rhine westphalia , hesse and thuringia - in which opel has factories - to take a share in the company as the state of lower saxony did in taking on 20 percent of volkswagen , the paper reported .
but some officials have suggested another tack .
the state premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , recently suggested a german-wide fund which could take a share in companies with key significance for the economy during emergencies , the paper said .
rüttgers is visiting the us this week and is scheduled to meet with gm officials in detroit on wednesday .
separately , german federal and regional government leaders are pressing the white house to extend any us federal aid to european units of gm and ford .
chancellor angela merkel said at the weekend she was waiting for gm to submit its north american restructuring plan before deciding on any rescue plan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .

she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .
she added it would fall exclusively to the european union to scrutinize french president nicolas sarkozy 's insistence on funnelling state aid to french carmakers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 16.02.2009 opinion : clinton right to make asia her first destination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on monday , hillary clinton arrives in japan , the first stop of an asia tour and her first foreign trip as us secretary of state .
the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .
reaching out to opel merkel said she would also see to it that us car manufacturer general motors ' european unit opel received help .
she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .
she added it would fall exclusively to the european union to scrutinize french president nicolas sarkozy 's insistence on funnelling state aid to french carmakers .
" it will all be looked at again in brussels and tested to see if it is a distortion of competition , " she said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .

specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .
public prosecutors are examining the data use to determine whether the company broke the law . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , for authorities to split carmaker opel from its stricken us parent general motors to save it from being dragged into crisis . klaus franz , head of the opel works council , said in an interview with daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on monday that splitting opel from its struggling us parent general motors was the only way to secure the german carmaker 's future .
" we can not carry on like this with gm , the only prospect is disentanglement , " franz told the paper .
behnam yazdani , head of the youth wing of the social democrats in southern hesse , also pressed for a split .
" opel 's woes are n't homemade .
they have a name - general motors , " yazdani told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors , which has been overtaken by toyota as the world 's largest carmaker , is riddled with problems the comments come ahead of a tuesday deadline for general motors and chrysler , two of america 's three big carmakers , to submit restructuring plans to the obama administration in return for their multimillion-dollar bailout .
gm is cutting thousands of jobs and closing plants as the global economic downturn and slumping demand for cars hits what was once the world 's largest carmaker .
gm is reported to urgently need $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- in new funds to stay afloat .
gm europe fears for future gm subsidiaries in europe , which are struggling with sluggish demand themselves , are fearful of the knock-on effects and potentially fatal cost-cutting .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
on monday , european labor leaders called for splitting the opel / vauxhall from gm brand rather than face being dragged down with its us parent .
" the spin-off of opel / vauxhall … .and the spin-off of -lrb- swedish brand -rrb- saab is the only reasonable and feasible option for general motors which would not destroy the european operations and its european assets and could avoid lawsuits , " a statement on gm europe 's labor force web site said .
berlin pressed to take action in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , opel management , unions and local politicians have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs .
on monday , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung said german state governments could buy a stake in opel to save the carmaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel fears gm 's restructuring plans could lead to job losses in germany one option would be for the states of north rhine westphalia , hesse and thuringia - in which opel has factories - to take a share in the company as the state of lower saxony did in taking on 20 percent of volkswagen , the paper reported .
but some officials have suggested another tack .
the state premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , recently suggested a german-wide fund which could take a share in companies with key significance for the economy during emergencies , the paper said .
rüttgers is visiting the us this week and is scheduled to meet with gm officials in detroit on wednesday .
separately , german federal and regional government leaders are pressing the white house to extend any us federal aid to european units of gm and ford .

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on sunday feb .

however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .

the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september .

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .
reaching out to opel merkel said she would also see to it that us car manufacturer general motors ' european unit opel received help .
she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .
she added it would fall exclusively to the european union to scrutinize french president nicolas sarkozy 's insistence on funnelling state aid to french carmakers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , for authorities to split carmaker opel from its stricken us parent general motors to save it from being dragged into crisis . klaus franz , head of the opel works council , said in an interview with daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on monday that splitting opel from its struggling us parent general motors was the only way to secure the german carmaker 's future .
" we can not carry on like this with gm , the only prospect is disentanglement , " franz told the paper .
behnam yazdani , head of the youth wing of the social democrats in southern hesse , also pressed for a split .
" opel 's woes are n't homemade .
they have a name - general motors , " yazdani told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors , which has been overtaken by toyota as the world 's largest carmaker , is riddled with problems the comments come ahead of a tuesday deadline for general motors and chrysler , two of america 's three big carmakers , to submit restructuring plans to the obama administration in return for their multimillion-dollar bailout .
gm is cutting thousands of jobs and closing plants as the global economic downturn and slumping demand for cars hits what was once the world 's largest carmaker .
gm is reported to urgently need $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- in new funds to stay afloat .
gm europe fears for future gm subsidiaries in europe , which are struggling with sluggish demand themselves , are fearful of the knock-on effects and potentially fatal cost-cutting .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
on monday , european labor leaders called for splitting the opel / vauxhall from gm brand rather than face being dragged down with its us parent .
" the spin-off of opel / vauxhall … .and the spin-off of -lrb- swedish brand -rrb- saab is the only reasonable and feasible option for general motors which would not destroy the european operations and its european assets and could avoid lawsuits , " a statement on gm europe 's labor force web site said .
berlin pressed to take action in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , opel management , unions and local politicians have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs .
on monday , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung said german state governments could buy a stake in opel to save the carmaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel fears gm 's restructuring plans could lead to job losses in germany one option would be for the states of north rhine westphalia , hesse and thuringia - in which opel has factories - to take a share in the company as the state of lower saxony did in taking on 20 percent of volkswagen , the paper reported .
but some officials have suggested another tack .
the state premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , recently suggested a german-wide fund which could take a share in companies with key significance for the economy during emergencies , the paper said .
rüttgers is visiting the us this week and is scheduled to meet with gm officials in detroit on wednesday .
separately , german federal and regional government leaders are pressing the white house to extend any us federal aid to european units of gm and ford .

the first trip is usually to europe or the mideast .
dw 's michael knigge has this analysis . with the decision to travel to asia , america 's new chief diplomat is showing where her emphasis lies .
traditionally , new us secretaries of state make their first trips to europe or to the middle east .
clinton 's preference for asia leads to a rather obvious and not entirely new interpretation - namely , that asia is taking priority over europe or the middle east in us foreign policy under barack obama .
the secretary of state 's trip to japan , indonesia , south korea and china symbolizes this change in outlook . there is no question that since the fall of the berlin wall , the us has changed its strategic focus .
asia has become more important while europe and the middle east have lost some of their relative weight .
however , in actual fact , europe still plays a strategically central role in us foreign policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's michael knigge while that can partially be explained by the many strong political , economic and cultural ties between europe and the us , it is also due to america 's desire to successfully pursue its interests .
to do this so-called " power projection , " even a superpower like the us needs partners .
and these days , particularly since the iraq war , washington knows that there is no other international partner besides europe where , despite all the differences , so many values and interests overlap . so why is clinton going to asia instead of europe , a place that the us seems to be appreciating again ?
the reasons are simple : the us vice-president 's first foreign trip was to europe , more specifically , to germany and the uk .
joe biden gave a much-anticipated speech in munich , seen by many as the first blueprint of the obama administration 's foreign policy . biden 's presence at the munich security conference was , from a protocol standpoint , even more unusual than clinton 's trip to asia .
normally , this security meeting is attended by the us secretary of defense .
but the man in that post , robert gates , while much admired by obama , remains a symbolic remnant of the bush administration under which he also served .
so it is understandable that the obama team chose someone else to announce their new foreign policy direction .
and since sending secretary of state clinton would have seemed an affront to gates , obama sent his own vice-president as well as national security advisor james jones to munich . both the sending of biden to munich and the fact that the vice-president gave a foreign policy keynote speech in europe illustrates clearly that the continent and washington are getting closer .
president obama himself is expected at the nato summit in baden-baden and strasbourg in april . even the middle east has no reason to feel snubbed by clinton 's asia trip , since george mitchell , obama 's new middle east envoy , went to the region right after the inauguration .
before the end of this month he is expected to go again .
the story is the same with afghanistan and pakistan , where richard holbrooke is engaged in a continual round of shuttle diplomacy . and with obama 's plate overflowing with crises to tackle , he has opted for a strategy of delegation .
in his much-discussed " team of rivals , " clinton , biden , gates , jones as well as mitchell and holbrook all play central roles . on the other hand , if clinton 's first foreign trip were scheduled for somewhere in europe or the middle east , asian countries might indeed feel snubbed , especially since they ca n't expect a visit from obama or biden in the first weeks of the new administration . for the us , the asian countries are simply too important to be ignored , or put off .
japan is a close ally and economic power ; indonesia is the world 's biggest muslim country ; south korea shares a border with an unpredictable north korea ; and china is a rapidly growing world power . clinton 's choice for her first trip abroad is a sensible one . michael knigge -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , for authorities to split carmaker opel from its stricken us parent general motors to save it from being dragged into crisis . klaus franz , head of the opel works council , said in an interview with daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on monday that splitting opel from its struggling us parent general motors was the only way to secure the german carmaker 's future .
" we can not carry on like this with gm , the only prospect is disentanglement , " franz told the paper .
behnam yazdani , head of the youth wing of the social democrats in southern hesse , also pressed for a split .
" opel 's woes are n't homemade .
they have a name - general motors , " yazdani told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors , which has been overtaken by toyota as the world 's largest carmaker , is riddled with problems the comments come ahead of a tuesday deadline for general motors and chrysler , two of america 's three big carmakers , to submit restructuring plans to the obama administration in return for their multimillion-dollar bailout .
gm is cutting thousands of jobs and closing plants as the global economic downturn and slumping demand for cars hits what was once the world 's largest carmaker .
gm is reported to urgently need $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- in new funds to stay afloat .
gm europe fears for future gm subsidiaries in europe , which are struggling with sluggish demand themselves , are fearful of the knock-on effects and potentially fatal cost-cutting .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
on monday , european labor leaders called for splitting the opel / vauxhall from gm brand rather than face being dragged down with its us parent .
" the spin-off of opel / vauxhall … .and the spin-off of -lrb- swedish brand -rrb- saab is the only reasonable and feasible option for general motors which would not destroy the european operations and its european assets and could avoid lawsuits , " a statement on gm europe 's labor force web site said .
berlin pressed to take action in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , opel management , unions and local politicians have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs .
on monday , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung said german state governments could buy a stake in opel to save the carmaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel fears gm 's restructuring plans could lead to job losses in germany one option would be for the states of north rhine westphalia , hesse and thuringia - in which opel has factories - to take a share in the company as the state of lower saxony did in taking on 20 percent of volkswagen , the paper reported .
but some officials have suggested another tack .
the state premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , recently suggested a german-wide fund which could take a share in companies with key significance for the economy during emergencies , the paper said .
rüttgers is visiting the us this week and is scheduled to meet with gm officials in detroit on wednesday .
separately , german federal and regional government leaders are pressing the white house to extend any us federal aid to european units of gm and ford .

the trend was reversed in 2007 and continued in 2008 , family minister ursula von der leyen confirmed in a newspaper interview on sunday , feb .
15 . the family minister , who will present a report on families on monday , said the rise in the number of children was especially pronounced in women between 30 and 40 years of age .
men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
after years of declining birth rates , the country reached a low in 2006 , with 673,000 births .
that was 27 percent lower than in 1946 , when germany was just emerging from the devastation of world war two .
the turning point came in 2007 , when germany registered 685,000 births , 12,000 more than in the previous year .
the upward trend continued last year with around 690,000 births , according to a prognosis by the federal statistics office , an increase of 5,000 over 2007 .
new thinking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen von der leyen said the reason behind the continuing rise in birth rates was a change in mentality .
" young people have the feeling that the society will not simply leave them behind as parents , " she said . von der leyen , herself a mother of seven , introduced a parental leave reform in 2007 which included new benefits for german fathers allowing them to stay at home for a time with their children .
the minister said her goal had been to lower the hurdles couples felt about having children .
according to surveys , 56 percent of stay-at-home mothers would like to work .
" but not at any price , " said von der leyen .
" they want good child care and part-time work .
we have to meet these mothers halfway . "
one survey carried out by the report found that 50 percent of those asked said the family policies of the current government had improved the situation for families .
around one-third said the situation had not changed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trend was reversed in 2007 and continued in 2008 , family minister ursula von der leyen confirmed in a newspaper interview on sunday , feb .
15 . the family minister , who will present a report on families on monday , said the rise in the number of children was especially pronounced in women between 30 and 40 years of age .
men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
after years of declining birth rates , the country reached a low in 2006 , with 673,000 births .
that was 27 percent lower than in 1946 , when germany was just emerging from the devastation of world war two .
the turning point came in 2007 , when germany registered 685,000 births , 12,000 more than in the previous year .
the upward trend continued last year with around 690,000 births , according to a prognosis by the federal statistics office , an increase of 5,000 over 2007 .

" young people have the feeling that the society will not simply leave them behind as parents , " she said . von der leyen , herself a mother of seven , introduced a parental leave reform in 2007 which included new benefits for german fathers allowing them to stay at home for a time with their children .
the minister said her goal had been to lower the hurdles couples felt about having children .
according to surveys , 56 percent of stay-at-home mothers would like to work .
" but not at any price , " said von der leyen .
" they want good child care and part-time work .
we have to meet these mothers halfway . "
one survey carried out by the report found that 50 percent of those asked said the family policies of the current government had improved the situation for families .

15 . the family minister , who will present a report on families on monday , said the rise in the number of children was especially pronounced in women between 30 and 40 years of age .
men are also expressing their desire to have more kids , she told the bild am sonntag newspaper .

" they want good child care and part-time work .
we have to meet these mothers halfway . "

16 , for authorities to split carmaker opel from its stricken us parent general motors to save it from being dragged into crisis . klaus franz , head of the opel works council , said in an interview with daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on monday that splitting opel from its struggling us parent general motors was the only way to secure the german carmaker 's future .
" we can not carry on like this with gm , the only prospect is disentanglement , " franz told the paper .
behnam yazdani , head of the youth wing of the social democrats in southern hesse , also pressed for a split .
" opel 's woes are n't homemade .
they have a name - general motors , " yazdani told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors , which has been overtaken by toyota as the world 's largest carmaker , is riddled with problems the comments come ahead of a tuesday deadline for general motors and chrysler , two of america 's three big carmakers , to submit restructuring plans to the obama administration in return for their multimillion-dollar bailout .
gm is cutting thousands of jobs and closing plants as the global economic downturn and slumping demand for cars hits what was once the world 's largest carmaker .
gm is reported to urgently need $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- in new funds to stay afloat .
gm europe fears for future gm subsidiaries in europe , which are struggling with sluggish demand themselves , are fearful of the knock-on effects and potentially fatal cost-cutting .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
on monday , european labor leaders called for splitting the opel / vauxhall from gm brand rather than face being dragged down with its us parent .
" the spin-off of opel / vauxhall … .and the spin-off of -lrb- swedish brand -rrb- saab is the only reasonable and feasible option for general motors which would not destroy the european operations and its european assets and could avoid lawsuits , " a statement on gm europe 's labor force web site said .
berlin pressed to take action in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , opel management , unions and local politicians have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs .
on monday , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung said german state governments could buy a stake in opel to save the carmaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel fears gm 's restructuring plans could lead to job losses in germany one option would be for the states of north rhine westphalia , hesse and thuringia - in which opel has factories - to take a share in the company as the state of lower saxony did in taking on 20 percent of volkswagen , the paper reported .
but some officials have suggested another tack .
the state premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , recently suggested a german-wide fund which could take a share in companies with key significance for the economy during emergencies , the paper said .
rüttgers is visiting the us this week and is scheduled to meet with gm officials in detroit on wednesday .
separately , german federal and regional government leaders are pressing the white house to extend any us federal aid to european units of gm and ford .
chancellor angela merkel said at the weekend she was waiting for gm to submit its north american restructuring plan before deciding on any rescue plan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .

" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .

16 , for authorities to split carmaker opel from its stricken us parent general motors to save it from being dragged into crisis . klaus franz , head of the opel works council , said in an interview with daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on monday that splitting opel from its struggling us parent general motors was the only way to secure the german carmaker 's future .
" we can not carry on like this with gm , the only prospect is disentanglement , " franz told the paper .
behnam yazdani , head of the youth wing of the social democrats in southern hesse , also pressed for a split .
" opel 's woes are n't homemade .
they have a name - general motors , " yazdani told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors , which has been overtaken by toyota as the world 's largest carmaker , is riddled with problems the comments come ahead of a tuesday deadline for general motors and chrysler , two of america 's three big carmakers , to submit restructuring plans to the obama administration in return for their multimillion-dollar bailout .
gm is cutting thousands of jobs and closing plants as the global economic downturn and slumping demand for cars hits what was once the world 's largest carmaker .
gm is reported to urgently need $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- in new funds to stay afloat .
gm europe fears for future gm subsidiaries in europe , which are struggling with sluggish demand themselves , are fearful of the knock-on effects and potentially fatal cost-cutting .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
on monday , european labor leaders called for splitting the opel / vauxhall from gm brand rather than face being dragged down with its us parent .
" the spin-off of opel / vauxhall … .and the spin-off of -lrb- swedish brand -rrb- saab is the only reasonable and feasible option for general motors which would not destroy the european operations and its european assets and could avoid lawsuits , " a statement on gm europe 's labor force web site said .
berlin pressed to take action in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , opel management , unions and local politicians have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs .
on monday , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung said german state governments could buy a stake in opel to save the carmaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel fears gm 's restructuring plans could lead to job losses in germany one option would be for the states of north rhine westphalia , hesse and thuringia - in which opel has factories - to take a share in the company as the state of lower saxony did in taking on 20 percent of volkswagen , the paper reported .
but some officials have suggested another tack .
the state premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , recently suggested a german-wide fund which could take a share in companies with key significance for the economy during emergencies , the paper said .
rüttgers is visiting the us this week and is scheduled to meet with gm officials in detroit on wednesday .
separately , german federal and regional government leaders are pressing the white house to extend any us federal aid to european units of gm and ford .
chancellor angela merkel said at the weekend she was waiting for gm to submit its north american restructuring plan before deciding on any rescue plan . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .

16 . the poll shows those in favor increased by eight points since november 2008 when the last irish times poll was published .
just 33 percent now say they would vote " no , " a drop of six points since november 's poll .
ireland rejected the eu 's lisbon treaty by 53.4 percent to 46.6 per cent in june last year .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-nation bloc , can not enter into force until all member states have ratified it .
in the poll , people were asked how they would vote in light of the eu 's commitment to allow ireland to retain a european commissioner along with legal guarantees on other irish concerns with regard to neutrality , abortion and taxation , according to the irish times .
minister of state for european affairs dick roche , responding to the poll , said that the recession was responsible for a change in the public mood .
there was a growing realization in ireland that the country 's future lies with the eu , he said .
poll based on flawed question , opponent says declan ganley , leader of libertas , the group which spearheaded the " no " campaign in ireland , said that the opinion poll was based on a flawed question which would lead people to believe that the treaty had been renegotiated .
he said the treaty is the same document rejected by irish voters last june .
colm burke , opposition fine gael mep for ireland south , called on the government sunday to hold the second lisbon treaty referendum in april , and not to wait until next autumn , as has been suggested .
" the current economic crisis has brought home to people , up and down the land , how vital is ireland 's membership of the european union , " ireland 's national broadcaster rte quoted him as saying .
" it is not alarmist to state that were we not inside the union , our economic plight would mirror that of iceland , with double digit interest rates and reliance on an international monetary fund bail-out , " he added .
burke said he would like to see the leaders of ireland 's three main parties , which all campaigned for a " yes " vote to the treaty last june , coming together and agreeing a joint policy platform for putting the lisbon treaty to the people in an early referendum . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.02.2009 berlin calms polish concerns over planned expellee center großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles are concerned the berlin center will paper over atrocities committed by the nazis germany and poland averted a row over a controversial museum that is to depict expellee experiences , with a polish envoy saying he was confident he could trust german chancellor angela merkel . wladyslaw bartoszewski , poland 's special representative for relations with germany , met in berlin with merkel on monday , feb .
16 .
there was no news conference , but he told polish reporters later he was " fully calmed and satisfied . " tension had earlier flared after polish diplomats reportedly heard that association of expellees president erika steinbach , 65 , would be appointed to the board of the planned berlin center , which is to depict how ethnic germans had to flee many nations after world war ii . many poles perceive the center as having an anti-polish agenda .
steinbach herself is viewed with revulsion by many poles because of her advocacy for ethnic germans expelled from polish soil between 1945 and 1947 .
steinbach is also a member of the german parliament for merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . not rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it will not forget the suffering that nazis unleashed ulrich wilhelm , the german government spokesman , said at a news conference , " the friendship , the partnership with poland is a very important objective for the federal government . "
he added that this had " a very high value . " wilhelm said the federally funded memorial would not attempt to reinterpret the history of world war ii and its aftermath .
he said germany admitted it was to blame for starting the war and all its consequences . he added that germany 's 1939 attack on poland , the start of the war , had " plunged europe into unfathomable suffering . " wilhelm said procedures to select the center 's board had not even begun .
a state minister , bernd neumann , who is a merkel aide , would meet with relevant organizations to hear their nominations .
germany 's cabinet would then select the members . the association of expellees decided in april 2008 to nominate steinbach to serve on the museum 's board and continues to stand by that decision , the group 's spokesman walter stratmann told the associated press on monday . sources added that the german government might postpone the issue , meaning the board could not be formed this year . steinbach under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of poland 's anger has been directed at steinbach poles have been outraged at steinbach 's criticism of their nation and her focus on the suffering of germans rather than victims of the nazis .
in the last few years , the expulsions have been the subject of a rash of german tv dramas . bartoszewski reportedly said sunday that poland would boycott some events with germany this year if steinbach were placed on the board . markus meckel , a foreign policy expert for the social democratic party , which rules in a grand coalition with merkel 's cdu , said steinbach should not be elected to the center 's board . " i assume foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will be clearly against accepting ms. steinbach when the cabinet meets , " he was quoted as saying by the daily berliner zeitung 's tuesday edition . after a right-wing administration in poland fiercely opposed the berlin memorial , polish prime minister donald tusk agreed to advise germany on keeping the museum neutral .
he is set to meet with merkel on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 16.02.2009 government mulls new workplace privacy legislation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn spying scandal has prompted discussion top government , union and industry representatives are meeting on monday , feb .
16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .
public prosecutors are examining the data use to determine whether the company broke the law . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , for authorities to split carmaker opel from its stricken us parent general motors to save it from being dragged into crisis . klaus franz , head of the opel works council , said in an interview with daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung on monday that splitting opel from its struggling us parent general motors was the only way to secure the german carmaker 's future .
" we can not carry on like this with gm , the only prospect is disentanglement , " franz told the paper .
behnam yazdani , head of the youth wing of the social democrats in southern hesse , also pressed for a split .
" opel 's woes are n't homemade .
they have a name - general motors , " yazdani told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general motors , which has been overtaken by toyota as the world 's largest carmaker , is riddled with problems the comments come ahead of a tuesday deadline for general motors and chrysler , two of america 's three big carmakers , to submit restructuring plans to the obama administration in return for their multimillion-dollar bailout .
gm is cutting thousands of jobs and closing plants as the global economic downturn and slumping demand for cars hits what was once the world 's largest carmaker .
gm is reported to urgently need $ 5 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros -rrb- in new funds to stay afloat .
gm europe fears for future gm subsidiaries in europe , which are struggling with sluggish demand themselves , are fearful of the knock-on effects and potentially fatal cost-cutting .
gm 's european brands include opel in germany , vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden .
gm also markets its chevrolet brand in europe .
on monday , european labor leaders called for splitting the opel / vauxhall from gm brand rather than face being dragged down with its us parent .
" the spin-off of opel / vauxhall … .and the spin-off of -lrb- swedish brand -rrb- saab is the only reasonable and feasible option for general motors which would not destroy the european operations and its european assets and could avoid lawsuits , " a statement on gm europe 's labor force web site said .
berlin pressed to take action in germany , where opel employs around 26,000 people in four plants , opel management , unions and local politicians have been pressing berlin to inject capital or offer loan guarantees to save jobs .
on monday , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung said german state governments could buy a stake in opel to save the carmaker .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel fears gm 's restructuring plans could lead to job losses in germany one option would be for the states of north rhine westphalia , hesse and thuringia - in which opel has factories - to take a share in the company as the state of lower saxony did in taking on 20 percent of volkswagen , the paper reported .
but some officials have suggested another tack .
the state premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , recently suggested a german-wide fund which could take a share in companies with key significance for the economy during emergencies , the paper said .
rüttgers is visiting the us this week and is scheduled to meet with gm officials in detroit on wednesday .
separately , german federal and regional government leaders are pressing the white house to extend any us federal aid to european units of gm and ford .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 16.02.2009 government mulls new workplace privacy legislation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn spying scandal has prompted discussion top government , union and industry representatives are meeting on monday , feb .
16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .
public prosecutors are examining the data use to determine whether the company broke the law . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .

continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .

diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .

" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 16.02.2009 merkel to seek control of ailing lender hre , another obtains aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel : extraordinary measures are needed as a further german banking group , mortgage lender aareal , says it will obtain billions of euros in aid , chancellor angela merkel says germany will have to take control of the badly hit bank hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- . merkel 's cabinet is to debate plans this wednesday to partly nationalize hre , a mortgage lender which spiralled into disaster last october and obtained huge federal guarantees .
current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .
reaching out to opel merkel said she would also see to it that us car manufacturer general motors ' european unit opel received help .
she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .
she added it would fall exclusively to the european union to scrutinize french president nicolas sarkozy 's insistence on funnelling state aid to french carmakers .
" it will all be looked at again in brussels and tested to see if it is a distortion of competition , " she said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .

current rules only allow the state to take over one third of a troubled bank .
speaking on zdf television , merkel said the government needed a voting majority at hre to shape its future .
" extraordinary crises require extraordinary solutions , " she said .
on sunday feb .
15 , aareal bank ag disclosed that the german state had granted it a non-voting capital injection and federal loan guarantees .
however , aareal insisted the move was purely precautionary and said it had ended 2008 in the black .
other banks to receive german government backing in the ongoing crisis have included commerzbank , which was one-quarter nationalized .
aareal said it had obtained a capital injection of 525 million euros -lrb- $ 682 million -rrb- , but the government would be a sleeping partner only .
it also accessed up to 4 billion euros in cover for its bond issues via federal loan guarantees .
in a statement from its head office in the city of wiesbaden , it said the aid had been promised by soffin , the german government 's frankfurt-based bank-bail-out agency .
playing the role of icebreaker " we are not applying to soffin in desperation , " said aareal chief executive wolf schumacher in a statement .
" our bank is completely healthy and there is nothing to indicate that this may change in the foreseeable future . " " we intend to play icebreaker in germany , " he added , referring to mutual reluctance among other banks to apply for government assistance .
" we have simply bought ourselves two insurance policies . "
schumacher said aareal believed it was strong enough to cope unaided with serious challenges such as the international financial markets crisis , but said aareal wanted the help because of stricter capital rules for banks .
it would also avoid being at a competitive disadvantage against rivals who were benefitting from state aid , he said .
he said the capital injection was similar to buying bonds and did not mean the german state had become a shareholder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aareal 's ceo says his bank 's situation is nothing like commerzbank " it 's a difference of night and day , " he said , adding that in the case of commerzbank , the government held actual equity .
" aareal remains a 100-percent private bank , " he said .
the injection had increased the underlying capital ratio at aareal from 8 to 10 percent .
aareal was to pay soffin as sleeping partner a return of 9 percent annually .
figures issued sunday showed a pre-tax surplus at aareal in 2008 of 117 million euros , down from 380 million euros in 2007 .
aareal did not forecast its earnings this year .
germany last year set aside 80 billion euros to inject into banks and authorized up to 400 billion euros in guarantees .
so far a total of 196 billion euros , mainly guarantees , has been approved , but soffin is dealing with dozens more applications .
reports of insider trading at hre commerzbank is the only bank to obtain a true equity injection , with germany obtaining just over 25 per cent of its shares .
hre , also a mortgage lender , has obtained guarantees extending to 52 billion euros , but has not taken equity assistance .
rejecting criticism that she was interfering with private enterprise , merkel said the move to take control of hre was aimed at getting germany 's welfare-oriented market economy back on track .
" the state can merely build bridges , " she said .
the cabinet is expected to discuss ways of forcing hre to accept state control .
in a separate development , a german newspaper is reporting that the country 's federal financial supervisory authority -lrb- bafin -rrb- was investigating several banks over alleged insider trading surrounding hre 's collapse in september . " the investigation is ongoing , " the federal watchdog confirmed in monday 's edition of the daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
the banks in question are suspected of having sold shares from hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- shortly before the troubled german property financing group collapsed .
reaching out to opel merkel said she would also see to it that us car manufacturer general motors ' european unit opel received help .
she said there might be a discussion of guarantees to opel , but berlin would wait to see what aid washington gave gm .
she added it would fall exclusively to the european union to scrutinize french president nicolas sarkozy 's insistence on funnelling state aid to french carmakers .

16 .
there was no news conference , but he told polish reporters later he was " fully calmed and satisfied . " tension had earlier flared after polish diplomats reportedly heard that association of expellees president erika steinbach , 65 , would be appointed to the board of the planned berlin center , which is to depict how ethnic germans had to flee many nations after world war ii . many poles perceive the center as having an anti-polish agenda .
steinbach herself is viewed with revulsion by many poles because of her advocacy for ethnic germans expelled from polish soil between 1945 and 1947 .
steinbach is also a member of the german parliament for merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- . not rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany said it will not forget the suffering that nazis unleashed ulrich wilhelm , the german government spokesman , said at a news conference , " the friendship , the partnership with poland is a very important objective for the federal government . "
he added that this had " a very high value . " wilhelm said the federally funded memorial would not attempt to reinterpret the history of world war ii and its aftermath .
he said germany admitted it was to blame for starting the war and all its consequences . he added that germany 's 1939 attack on poland , the start of the war , had " plunged europe into unfathomable suffering . " wilhelm said procedures to select the center 's board had not even begun .
a state minister , bernd neumann , who is a merkel aide , would meet with relevant organizations to hear their nominations .
germany 's cabinet would then select the members . the association of expellees decided in april 2008 to nominate steinbach to serve on the museum 's board and continues to stand by that decision , the group 's spokesman walter stratmann told the associated press on monday . sources added that the german government might postpone the issue , meaning the board could not be formed this year . steinbach under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of poland 's anger has been directed at steinbach poles have been outraged at steinbach 's criticism of their nation and her focus on the suffering of germans rather than victims of the nazis .
in the last few years , the expulsions have been the subject of a rash of german tv dramas . bartoszewski reportedly said sunday that poland would boycott some events with germany this year if steinbach were placed on the board . markus meckel , a foreign policy expert for the social democratic party , which rules in a grand coalition with merkel 's cdu , said steinbach should not be elected to the center 's board . " i assume foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will be clearly against accepting ms. steinbach when the cabinet meets , " he was quoted as saying by the daily berliner zeitung 's tuesday edition . after a right-wing administration in poland fiercely opposed the berlin memorial , polish prime minister donald tusk agreed to advise germany on keeping the museum neutral .
he is set to meet with merkel on feb .

between 15 and 20 neo-nazis are reported to have assaulted the occupants of two buses at the teufelsstahl rest stop on the a4 highway .
the attack on the some 80 labor union members , peace activists and members of the left party from the states of hesse and north rhine-westphalia occurred when they were on their way home from protesting a 6,000-strong neo-nazi march in dresden to commemorate the victims of the 1945 allied bombing raids on the eastern german city .
police have created a special working group to investigate the incident .
police too late on the scene ?
“ the neo-nazis attacked our two buses with the words ‘ attack anti-fascists , ' bottles and blocks of ice weighing several kilos , ” holger kindler , head of the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , which took part in the anti-fascist protest , told the ap news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent scuffles broke out between police and protesters in dresden over the weekend the chartered bus full of 41 neo-nazis left the rest stop by the time the police arrived on the scene .
but they were stopped further down the road while police took down their personal information .
on monday , the dpa news agency reported that police officials had no evidence yet that the swedish nationals on the coach were specifically to blame , but said they wanted to catch them before they left germany to go back to sweden .
“ it is inconceivable that the departure of these dangerous thugs could go unobserved by the police , ” bodo ramelow , deputy chairman of the left party , told dpa .
he demanded an investigation by the thuringia state parliament .
police said a similar attack on leftists at another highway stop near the city of chemnitz over the weekend by homebound neo-nazis left four persons slightly injured .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 16.02.2009 government mulls new workplace privacy legislation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn spying scandal has prompted discussion top government , union and industry representatives are meeting on monday , feb .
16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .
public prosecutors are examining the data use to determine whether the company broke the law . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 16.02.2009 a year after independence , kosovo at peace but problems remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one year on from its unilateral declaration of independence , kosovo is still unstable administering kosovo in the year following its secession from serbia has been a challenge for the eu , with lawlessness undermining economic progress .
that the eu is divided about kosovo does n't help either . kosovo celebrates its first anniversary of political independence from serbia on tuesday february 17 , but reports of the mini-state 's success as a sovereign nation have been dismal .
the belief by many that independence would quickly put an end to the country 's extreme poverty and misery has evaporated among its mainly ethnic albanian population .
with the moribund economy still dependent on substantial foreign capital , nearly half of the workforce is unemployed and many kosovo albanians barely survive on remittances from relatives working in the european union .
in spite of billions of euros that have been pumped into kosovo since the end of the war a decade ago , the country 's infrastructure and public roads are in need of repair .
lawlessness and corruption kosovo had been a ward of the united nations since the end of the war in 1999 , but it took nearly a year to deploy the eu 's law-enforcing eulex mission , whose mandate is to replace the dwindling un forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took nearly a year for the eu mission to replace the un 's since the 205-million-euro -lrb- $ 261 million -rrb- bill for sending security forces , judges and prosecutors had been footed in advance , the cause for the delay in transferring administrative authority from the un to the eu was due to political rather than financial factors .
continual wrangling between the eu and the un missions over jurisdiction has left one-quarter of kosovo 's territory under the control of neither , creating a vacuum where local smugglers engage in the illicit trade of everything from petrol to human beings .
corruption is rampant among not only among local politicians and bureaucrats , but has filtered up to international officials .
the chaos and lawlessness also help the serb minority , who mainly reside in kosovo 's north to resist pristina 's authority .
diplomats and observers say that the problems are likely to remain for a long time .
ethnic conflicts still below the surface to many , it appears that kosovo lost its place at the top of the international agenda as soon as the immediate risk of renewed bloodshed abated .
but ethnic tensions and conflicts are still bubbling below the surface .
on february 10 , thousands of serbs in the town of mitrovica staged a protest against the ethnic albanian majority 's security forces .
" the situation in kosovo has remained stable in the past year , but -lrb- the protest -rrb- highlights the continued fragility of the situation on the ground , " said pieter feith , the eu 's special representative to pristina , to the afp news agency .
the eu blames belgrade for hampering eulex 's work in the majority serb parts of the country . joost lagendijk , a high-level eu official told afp , " it means that the mission depends on the goodwill of the serbs in these areas , and the courts there and serbian police do not want to cooperate with eulex or apply kosovo 's laws . " conflicts for moderate serbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security forces are essential for preventing outbreaks of violence analysts say that moderate serbs are in a difficult bind when it comes to cooperating with the eu 's eulex forces , since the leadership in belgrade does not want to be seen as supporting kosovo 's independence .
european diplomats do n't want to be seen forcing belgrade 's hand either , for fear of undermining the moderate pro-european government of boris tadic and bolstering nationalists .
another reason for eu caution has to do with internal bickering among the member states with regard to kosovo 's split from serbia . the former autonomous serbian province unilaterally declared its independence one year ago on february 17 , prompting 22 out of 27 eu states to recognise the tiny new country in the balkans .
eu internal divisions on kosovo the european union 's big three - germany , france and the uk - all recognized kosovo and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier even termed the split a " european success . "
but spain , which worries about its own separatist movements in catalonia and the basque country , viewed kosovo 's secession as a violation of international law .
so far 54 countries , including the united states , have recognized kosovo .
but moscow , in support of its serb ally , has used its permanent seat in the united nations security council to strongly condemn pristina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dangling the carrot of eu membership would bring stability to the balkans the serbs regard kosovo as the cradle of their civilization and national identity and say they would never recognise pristina .
the eu , which generally supports the policy of the big three , has argued that kosovo , due to its history of ethnic cleansing at the hands of serbian forces , has always been a special case .
eu top diplomat javier solana and most european leaders were convinced that there was no alternative to independence for the country after peace efforts brokered by the un had failed . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 16.02.2009 government mulls new workplace privacy legislation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche bahn spying scandal has prompted discussion top government , union and industry representatives are meeting on monday , feb .
16 to discuss workplace privacy legislation in the wake of a spying scandal at national rail operator , deutsche bahn . at the invitation of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , the government 's labor and economics ministers , data protection commissioner and union and industry representatives are meeting to discuss privacy in the workplace .
specifically , the issue on the table is whether there should be a law banning companies from conducting vetting schemes on their employees , even if the purpose is to root out corruption .
ahead of the talks , schaeuble himself spoke out against a legal ban on data merging - in other words , screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies .
currently , such screening is legal only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree to it beforehand .
however , as scandals at deutsche bahn , national telecommunications operator deutsche telekom as well as several discounter supermarket chains have shown , companies have been engaging in covert screening and surveillance operations , for purposes many say had nothing to do with combating corruption .
still , schaeuble told the monday edition of the berlin daily tagesspiegel he believes employers have to be left some scope to take action when they suspect corruption among the workforce .
" precisely in large companies , there 's the danger of corruption , and it 's the duty of the management board to take action against this , " he told the paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are at the behest of interior minister wolfgang schaeuble he added that there has to be a balance between an employer 's interest in preventing corruption and an employee 's right to privacy .
a law against data merging " would be a step too far , " schaeuble warned .
the confederation of german employers , bda , also maintains that germany 's existing privacy legislation is sufficient , and that there is no need for a special law to protect employee privacy .
the current laws could , at most , be fleshed out with a few additional clauses , bda head reinhard göhner told public broadcaster ard on monday . unions want better protection the bda 's view is at odds with the position taken by the association of german unions , dgb , which says that employees need to be protected from unwittingly being spied on by their employers .
dgb head michael sommer told berlin 's rbb-inforadio on monday that an employee privacy protection act is urgently needed .
if a company has legitimate grounds to suspect corruption in an employee , it should inform the police and state prosecutors , not take on the role of detective itself , he said .
the head of germany 's services union verdi has also called for legislation against unauthorized disclosure of information about employees .
frank bsirske , who was himself targeted in the surveillance operation conducted by deutsche telekom , told ard that the recent scandals at telekom and deutsche bahn brought to mind the kind of " secret police tactics " that not even the federal criminal police office is authorized to use .
ahead of monday 's talks , germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar , said the country can not sanction the kind of covert surveillance operations carried out by deutsche bahn .
the company has acknowledged that the bank data of 173,000 employees was secretly compared with customer data in an effort to uncover corrupt practices .
the first operation was conducted in 2002-2003 and , according to new information confirmed by deutsche bahn two weeks ago , a second employee investigation was carried out in 2005 .
public prosecutors are examining the data use to determine whether the company broke the law . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the polar bear , its plight , its size , shape and life in the frozen north seems to have gripped the public 's imagination .
polar bears have also been at the centre of controversy about the keeping of animals in zoos .
and a cgi version terrorises the characters of a hit us television show . "
the polar bear , as a charismatic and much admired creature , has been adopted as an arctic icon to motivate action to tackle climate change " diane walkington wwf-uk polar bear skull defies dna test diane walkington , head of species at conservation body wwf-uk , said the polar bear was an iconic emblem of the arctic .
she said : " the species has also become symbolic of climate change and all that we stand to lose if we fail to preserve the arctic 's fragile future , as well as other critical ecosystems around the world .
" based on extremely conservative forecasts about the future loss of sea ice , scientists have estimated that two-thirds of today 's polar bear population could become extinct by 2050 .
" this loss would also have wider impacts on many other arctic dwelling species and the indigenous people who live there , and on the arctic 's ability to help regulate the planet 's climate .
" the polar bear , as a charismatic and much admired creature , has been adopted as an arctic icon to motivate action to tackle climate change . "
lost a mysterious pacific island on which the passengers of a crashed airliner , oceanic flight 815 , fight for survival must rank as one of the most unusual places to find a polar bear .
but one - of the computer generated variety - appears on the fictional island at the centre of us hit series lost .
now in its penultimate season , the bizarre twists and turns of the series have included time travel , a 19th century sailing ship called the black rock , rat runs of underground bunkers , a cursed lottery winner and people trying to escape their pasts .
the lives of the oceanic survivors are threatened by the sinister others , a smoke monster and a bad guy played by alan dale aka jim robinson in neighbours .
however , striking fear in the hearts of many of the characters is the polar bear .
a skeleton of one is also uncovered in the sahara desert and appears in the pages of a comic book read by one of the young airline passengers .
cgi bears also feature prominently in film the golden compass based on the books by philip pullman .
knut knut - a polar bear at berlin zoo - has drawn crowds in their hundreds but also an anonymous death threat as he became the focus of fierce debate over the keeping of animals in zoos .
after his birth in 2006 , knut suddenly became an international celebrity , drawing huge crowds to the berlin zoo and the cub even appeared on the cover of vanity fair .
in 2007 alone knut generated more than 5m euros -lrb- £ 4.2m ; $ 6.3m -rrb- in extra income for berlin zoo , from the sale of tickets , cuddly knut toys , t-shirts and other knut-branded items , the german newspaper tagesspiegel reported .
thomas doerflein , the zookeeper who dedicated himself to bringing up germany 's celebrity polar bear , died suddenly last september .
us election north america 's polar bears were a feature of the us presidential election .
republican presidential candidate john mccain 's running mate sarah palin drew flak from wildlife lovers during last year 's battle for the white house .
a keen hunter , she backed legislation to encourage the aerial hunting of wolves , as a " predator control " measure .
she also opposed the us government 's listing of a variety of animals as endangered , including the polar bear and the beluga whale .
and unlike mr mccain , she actively supports drilling for oil in the arctic national wildlife refuge , which provides habitat for the bears .
democrats barack obama and john biden won the election .
global warming a 16ft -lrb- 5m -rrb- sculpture of a polar bear and cub stranded on an iceberg was pulled along the thames to raise awareness of climate change in january .
the structure was launched in greenwich , south east london , before being pulled by a tug to tower bridge and the houses of parliament .
the stunt was to highlight the plight of the arctic mammal which is facing extinction due to global warming .
a team of 15 artists spent two months working on the 1.5 tonne sculpture .
wildlife broadcaster sir david attenborough said at the time : " the melting of the polar bears ' sea ice habitat is one of the most pressing environmental concerns of our time .
" we need to do what we can to protect the world 's largest land carnivores from extinction . "
wwf previously warned that polar bears could be extinct within 20 years if there was not a slow down of global warming .
snow bear the sight of polar bear cuddly toys , ceramic ornaments , christmas tree ornaments and adorning festive bowls and mugs seems to be more common each christmas .
the large white bears - and the world they inhabit - fit the bill for that time of year .
a polar bear sculpture covered in festive lights was a feature on inverness 's ness islands during the city 's winter festival in 2008 .
the event had to be cancelled early after vandals struck .

ireland-based genetics expert ceiridwen edwards had hoped to compare the dna of the animal found in a cave in scotland with that of modern polar bears .
however , she said there was not enough dna left in the sample for an analysis to be done .

dr edwards told the bbc scotland news website : " the original rationale behind targeting the inchnadamph polar bear for ancient dna analysis was to try and generate an ancient sequence from a morphological polar bear .
" the only sequences of polar bear are from modern samples , and i was wondering if there would be any significant difference between modern and ancient sequences .
" i can usually tell by the colour and texture of a bone sample if it will yield dna or not , and the inchnadamph polar bear seemed to me to have a chance of giving data . "
' water leaching ' however , in an effort to protect the skull , a smaller sample of bone than dr edwards would normally work with was extracted .
dr edwards said : " this would not have made much difference to the overall results as , if there is any dna present in a sample , having a small starting amount does not usually jeopardise success .
" therefore , i rather think the problem was that there was little or no dna left in the skull - possibly due to water leaching the dna out of the bone while it was in the cave . "
she added : " this was such a shame as i would very much have liked to get some ancient polar bear data with which to compare to both modern polar bear and from a number of other archaeological bears . "

the first pieces of bone from the skeleton were found in 1995 by cavers , but it was only later that edinburgh-based caving club , grampian speleological group , reached some of the final fragments .

conservative muslims who teach that islam is incompatible with western democracy will be challenged as part of a new approach , panorama has been told .
a senior whitehall source said that muslim leaders who urge separation will be isolated and publicly rejected .
he also said this would occur even if their comments fell within the law .
this will include those who argue that muslims should not vote and that homosexuals should be condemned on religious grounds .
panorama 's source said that britain " needs to identify and back shared values " and that this new thinking will be central to a new counter-terrorism policy called contest 2 due to be launched this spring .
intelligence gathering panorama has been looking at the issue of islamic extremism for its programme muslim first , british second , which will be broadcast on 16 february .
panorama has also been told by a separate counter-terrorism source that more emphasis will be placed on gathering intelligence about extremism from inside the muslim community .
the home office is currently spending £ 80m on community projects designed to stop young muslims from being radicalised and the source said that some of these projects are being targeted by intelligence analysts . "
we want to move away from just challenging violent extremism .
we now believe that we should challenge people who are against democracy and state institutions " panorama 's whitehall source fears over ' war ' with extremism send us your comments however , this was denied by the police .
sir norman bettison from the association of chief police officers , who , when asked if community projects are being used as " trojan horses " to gather information , told the programme there was " no dedicated intelligence gathering " as part of the prevent community work .
the government 's counter-terrorism strategy is based on what officials call the " four ps " - prevent , pursue , protect and prepare .
the " prevent " element of the strategy aims to block radicalisation and reduce the supply of terror recruits by working with local communities .
but sir norman accepted that as part of the " pursue " element of the strategy , police and other officials would use " any means available to get the information that is required to prosecute people committing criminal acts " .
labour peer lord ahmed said he would welcome a tougher approach .
" those who preach hate , those who preach divisions , those who create hatred within societies , i think they need to be isolated , " he said .
" we need to empower the mainstream muslim leadership and the scholars so they can actually hold the arguments and debates within the muslim society . "
influence on the young up until now britain 's counter-terrorism policy has only targeted those who preach support for violent extremism .
but according to panorama 's whitehall source this will now change : " we want to move away from just challenging violent extremism .
we now believe that we should challenge people who are against democracy and state institutions " , he said .
the shift in position will be welcomed by those who believe that islamic extremism feeds off religious separatism and intolerance .
there are some well-known preachers , many of them especially popular amongst the young , who condemn terrorism , yet also emphasise islam 's incompatibility with the west .
sheikh khalid yassin , one of the stars of the preaching circuit , has lectured about his contempt for homosexuals saying : " if you prefer the clothing of the kaffirs -lsb- non-believers -rsb- other than the clothing of the muslims - most of those names on most of that clothing is faggots , homosexuals and lesbians . "
another influential preacher , abdurraheem green , whose internet lectures receive hundreds of thousands of hits , preaches that " islam is not compatible with democracy " and that to prevent a wife committing " evil " a husband has the right to " apply some type of physical force ... a very light beating " - though he says this should not leave any marks .
problem or solution despite these conservative views the metropolitan police has sought abdurraheem green 's advice recently . "
one thing i have been very consistent on is terrorism , participating in terrorist activities , violent revolution - is not something that i have ever thought was part of the religion of islam " abdurraheem green and the preacher himself insists that in spite of his conservative views about life in britain he is " part of the solution " to extremism because young people listen to him .
" i surely have said some pretty radical things and maybe even written some radical things in the past , " he told panorama .
" but one thing i have been very consistent on is terrorism , participating in terrorist activities , violent revolution - is not something that i have ever thought was part of the religion of islam . "
some senior police officers argue it is vital to work with radicals because they have credibility amongst young british muslims .
but some moderate scholars warn this is a dangerous road .
sheikh musa admani , imam at london metropolitan university , says if advice is sought from the radicals , or if they are funded with public money , then " muslims are going to endorse them as a whole and so there 's the danger " .

conservative muslims who teach that islam is incompatible with western democracy will be challenged as part of a new approach , panorama has been told .
a senior whitehall source said that muslim leaders who urge separation will be isolated and publicly rejected .
he also said this would occur even if their comments fell within the law .
this will include those who argue that muslims should not vote and that homosexuals should be condemned on religious grounds .
panorama 's source said that britain " needs to identify and back shared values " and that this new thinking will be central to a new counter-terrorism policy called contest 2 due to be launched this spring .
intelligence gathering panorama has been looking at the issue of islamic extremism for its programme muslim first , british second , which will be broadcast on 16 february .
panorama has also been told by a separate counter-terrorism source that more emphasis will be placed on gathering intelligence about extremism from inside the muslim community .
the home office is currently spending £ 80m on community projects designed to stop young muslims from being radicalised and the source said that some of these projects are being targeted by intelligence analysts .
we want to move away from just challenging violent extremism .
we now believe that we should challenge people who are against democracy and state institutions panorama 's whitehall source fears over ' war ' with extremism send us your comments however , this was denied by the police .
sir norman bettison from the association of chief police officers , who , when asked if community projects are being used as " trojan horses " to gather information , told the programme there was " no dedicated intelligence gathering " as part of the prevent community work .
the government 's counter-terrorism strategy is based on what officials call the " four ps " - prevent , pursue , protect and prepare .
the " prevent " element of the strategy aims to block radicalisation and reduce the supply of terror recruits by working with local communities .
but sir norman accepted that as part of the " pursue " element of the strategy , police and other officials would use " any means available to get the information that is required to prosecute people committing criminal acts " .
labour peer lord ahmed said he would welcome a tougher approach .
" those who preach hate , those who preach divisions , those who create hatred within societies , i think they need to be isolated , " he said .
" we need to empower the mainstream muslim leadership and the scholars so they can actually hold the arguments and debates within the muslim society . "
influence on the young up until now britain 's counter-terrorism policy has only targeted those who preach support for violent extremism .
but according to panorama 's whitehall source this will now change : " we want to move away from just challenging violent extremism .
we now believe that we should challenge people who are against democracy and state institutions " , he said .
the shift in position will be welcomed by those who believe that islamic extremism feeds off religious separatism and intolerance .

panorama reporter richard watson talks about muslim first , british second there are some well-known preachers , many of them especially popular amongst the young , who condemn terrorism , yet also emphasise islam 's incompatibility with the west .
sheikh khalid yassin , one of the stars of the preaching circuit , has lectured about his contempt for homosexuals saying : " if you prefer the clothing of the kaffirs -lsb- non-believers -rsb- other than the clothing of the muslims - most of those names on most of that clothing is faggots , homosexuals and lesbians . "
another influential preacher , abdurraheem green , whose internet lectures receive hundreds of thousands of hits , preaches that " islam is not compatible with democracy " and that to prevent a wife committing " evil " a husband has the right to " apply some type of physical force ... a very light beating " - though he says this should not leave any marks .
problem or solution despite these conservative views the metropolitan police has sought abdurraheem green 's advice recently .
one thing i have been very consistent on is terrorism , participating in terrorist activities , violent revolution - is not something that i have ever thought was part of the religion of islam abdurraheem green and the preacher himself insists that in spite of his conservative views about life in britain he is " part of the solution " to extremism because young people listen to him .
" i surely have said some pretty radical things and maybe even written some radical things in the past , " he told panorama .
" but one thing i have been very consistent on is terrorism , participating in terrorist activities , violent revolution - is not something that i have ever thought was part of the religion of islam . "
some senior police officers argue it is vital to work with radicals because they have credibility amongst young british muslims .
but some moderate scholars warn this is a dangerous road .

conservative muslims who teach that islam is incompatible with western democracy will be challenged as part of a new approach , panorama has been told .
a senior whitehall source said that muslim leaders who urge separation will be isolated and publicly rejected .
he also said this would occur even if their comments fell within the law .
this will include those who argue that muslims should not vote and that homosexuals should be condemned on religious grounds .
panorama 's source said that britain " needs to identify and back shared values " and that this new thinking will be central to a new counter-terrorism policy called contest 2 due to be launched this spring .
intelligence gathering panorama has been looking at the issue of islamic extremism for its programme muslim first , british second , which will be broadcast on 16 february .
panorama has also been told by a separate counter-terrorism source that more emphasis will be placed on gathering intelligence about extremism from inside the muslim community .
the home office is currently spending £ 80m on community projects designed to stop young muslims from being radicalised and the source said that some of these projects are being targeted by intelligence analysts .
we want to move away from just challenging violent extremism .
we now believe that we should challenge people who are against democracy and state institutions panorama 's whitehall source fears over ' war ' with extremism send us your comments however , this was denied by the police .
sir norman bettison from the association of chief police officers , who , when asked if community projects are being used as " trojan horses " to gather information , told the programme there was " no dedicated intelligence gathering " as part of the prevent community work .
the government 's counter-terrorism strategy is based on what officials call the " four ps " - prevent , pursue , protect and prepare .
the " prevent " element of the strategy aims to block radicalisation and reduce the supply of terror recruits by working with local communities .
but sir norman accepted that as part of the " pursue " element of the strategy , police and other officials would use " any means available to get the information that is required to prosecute people committing criminal acts " .
labour peer lord ahmed said he would welcome a tougher approach .
" those who preach hate , those who preach divisions , those who create hatred within societies , i think they need to be isolated , " he said .
" we need to empower the mainstream muslim leadership and the scholars so they can actually hold the arguments and debates within the muslim society . "
influence on the young up until now britain 's counter-terrorism policy has only targeted those who preach support for violent extremism .
but according to panorama 's whitehall source this will now change : " we want to move away from just challenging violent extremism .
we now believe that we should challenge people who are against democracy and state institutions " , he said .
the shift in position will be welcomed by those who believe that islamic extremism feeds off religious separatism and intolerance .

panorama reporter richard watson talks about muslim first , british second there are some well-known preachers , many of them especially popular amongst the young , who condemn terrorism , yet also emphasise islam 's incompatibility with the west .
sheikh khalid yassin , one of the stars of the preaching circuit , has lectured about his contempt for homosexuals saying : " if you prefer the clothing of the kaffirs -lsb- non-believers -rsb- other than the clothing of the muslims - most of those names on most of that clothing is faggots , homosexuals and lesbians . "
another influential preacher , abdurraheem green , whose internet lectures receive hundreds of thousands of hits , preaches that " islam is not compatible with democracy " and that to prevent a wife committing " evil " a husband has the right to " apply some type of physical force ... a very light beating " - though he says this should not leave any marks .
problem or solution despite these conservative views the metropolitan police has sought abdurraheem green 's advice recently .
one thing i have been very consistent on is terrorism , participating in terrorist activities , violent revolution - is not something that i have ever thought was part of the religion of islam abdurraheem green and the preacher himself insists that in spite of his conservative views about life in britain he is " part of the solution " to extremism because young people listen to him .
" i surely have said some pretty radical things and maybe even written some radical things in the past , " he told panorama .
" but one thing i have been very consistent on is terrorism , participating in terrorist activities , violent revolution - is not something that i have ever thought was part of the religion of islam . "
some senior police officers argue it is vital to work with radicals because they have credibility amongst young british muslims .
but some moderate scholars warn this is a dangerous road .
sheikh musa admani , imam at london metropolitan university , says if advice is sought from the radicals , or if they are funded with public money , then " muslims are going to endorse them as a whole and so there 's the danger " .

conservative muslims who teach that islam is incompatible with western democracy will be challenged as part of a new approach , panorama has been told .
a senior whitehall source said that muslim leaders who urge separation will be isolated and publicly rejected .
he also said this would occur even if their comments fell within the law .
this will include those who argue that muslims should not vote and that homosexuals should be condemned on religious grounds .
panorama 's source said that britain " needs to identify and back shared values " and that this new thinking will be central to a new counter-terrorism policy called contest 2 due to be launched this spring .
intelligence gathering panorama has been looking at the issue of islamic extremism for its programme muslim first , british second , which will be broadcast on 16 february .
panorama has also been told by a separate counter-terrorism source that more emphasis will be placed on gathering intelligence about extremism from inside the muslim community .
the home office is currently spending £ 80m on community projects designed to stop young muslims from being radicalised and the source said that some of these projects are being targeted by intelligence analysts .
we want to move away from just challenging violent extremism .
we now believe that we should challenge people who are against democracy and state institutions panorama 's whitehall source fears over ' war ' with extremism send us your comments however , this was denied by the police .
sir norman bettison from the association of chief police officers , who , when asked if community projects are being used as " trojan horses " to gather information , told the programme there was " no dedicated intelligence gathering " as part of the prevent community work .
the government 's counter-terrorism strategy is based on what officials call the " four ps " - prevent , pursue , protect and prepare .
the " prevent " element of the strategy aims to block radicalisation and reduce the supply of terror recruits by working with local communities .
but sir norman accepted that as part of the " pursue " element of the strategy , police and other officials would use " any means available to get the information that is required to prosecute people committing criminal acts " .
labour peer lord ahmed said he would welcome a tougher approach .
" those who preach hate , those who preach divisions , those who create hatred within societies , i think they need to be isolated , " he said .
" we need to empower the mainstream muslim leadership and the scholars so they can actually hold the arguments and debates within the muslim society . "
influence on the young up until now britain 's counter-terrorism policy has only targeted those who preach support for violent extremism .
but according to panorama 's whitehall source this will now change : " we want to move away from just challenging violent extremism .
we now believe that we should challenge people who are against democracy and state institutions " , he said .
the shift in position will be welcomed by those who believe that islamic extremism feeds off religious separatism and intolerance .

panorama reporter richard watson talks about muslim first , british second there are some well-known preachers , many of them especially popular amongst the young , who condemn terrorism , yet also emphasise islam 's incompatibility with the west .
sheikh khalid yassin , one of the stars of the preaching circuit , has lectured about his contempt for homosexuals saying : " if you prefer the clothing of the kaffirs -lsb- non-believers -rsb- other than the clothing of the muslims - most of those names on most of that clothing is faggots , homosexuals and lesbians . "
another influential preacher , abdurraheem green , whose internet lectures receive hundreds of thousands of hits , preaches that " islam is not compatible with democracy " and that to prevent a wife committing " evil " a husband has the right to " apply some type of physical force ... a very light beating " - though he says this should not leave any marks .
problem or solution despite these conservative views the metropolitan police has sought abdurraheem green 's advice recently .
one thing i have been very consistent on is terrorism , participating in terrorist activities , violent revolution - is not something that i have ever thought was part of the religion of islam abdurraheem green and the preacher himself insists that in spite of his conservative views about life in britain he is " part of the solution " to extremism because young people listen to him .
" i surely have said some pretty radical things and maybe even written some radical things in the past , " he told panorama .
" but one thing i have been very consistent on is terrorism , participating in terrorist activities , violent revolution - is not something that i have ever thought was part of the religion of islam . "
some senior police officers argue it is vital to work with radicals because they have credibility amongst young british muslims .
but some moderate scholars warn this is a dangerous road .
sheikh musa admani , imam at london metropolitan university , says if advice is sought from the radicals , or if they are funded with public money , then " muslims are going to endorse them as a whole and so there 's the danger " .

conservative muslims who teach that islam is incompatible with western democracy will be challenged as part of a new approach , panorama has been told .
a senior whitehall source said that muslim leaders who urge separation will be isolated and publicly rejected .
he also said this would occur even if their comments fell within the law .
this will include those who argue that muslims should not vote and that homosexuals should be condemned on religious grounds .
panorama 's source said that britain " needs to identify and back shared values " and that this new thinking will be central to a new counter-terrorism policy called contest 2 due to be launched this spring .
intelligence gathering panorama has been looking at the issue of islamic extremism for its programme muslim first , british second , which will be broadcast on 16 february .
panorama has also been told by a separate counter-terrorism source that more emphasis will be placed on gathering intelligence about extremism from inside the muslim community .
the home office is currently spending £ 80m on community projects designed to stop young muslims from being radicalised and the source said that some of these projects are being targeted by intelligence analysts .
we want to move away from just challenging violent extremism .
we now believe that we should challenge people who are against democracy and state institutions panorama 's whitehall source fears over ' war ' with extremism send us your comments however , this was denied by the police .
sir norman bettison from the association of chief police officers , who , when asked if community projects are being used as " trojan horses " to gather information , told the programme there was " no dedicated intelligence gathering " as part of the prevent community work .
the government 's counter-terrorism strategy is based on what officials call the " four ps " - prevent , pursue , protect and prepare .
the " prevent " element of the strategy aims to block radicalisation and reduce the supply of terror recruits by working with local communities .
but sir norman accepted that as part of the " pursue " element of the strategy , police and other officials would use " any means available to get the information that is required to prosecute people committing criminal acts " .
labour peer lord ahmed said he would welcome a tougher approach .
" those who preach hate , those who preach divisions , those who create hatred within societies , i think they need to be isolated , " he said .
" we need to empower the mainstream muslim leadership and the scholars so they can actually hold the arguments and debates within the muslim society . "
influence on the young up until now britain 's counter-terrorism policy has only targeted those who preach support for violent extremism .
but according to panorama 's whitehall source this will now change : " we want to move away from just challenging violent extremism .
we now believe that we should challenge people who are against democracy and state institutions " , he said .
the shift in position will be welcomed by those who believe that islamic extremism feeds off religious separatism and intolerance .

panorama reporter richard watson talks about muslim first , british second there are some well-known preachers , many of them especially popular amongst the young , who condemn terrorism , yet also emphasise islam 's incompatibility with the west .
sheikh khalid yassin , one of the stars of the preaching circuit , has lectured about his contempt for homosexuals saying : " if you prefer the clothing of the kaffirs -lsb- non-believers -rsb- other than the clothing of the muslims - most of those names on most of that clothing is faggots , homosexuals and lesbians . "
another influential preacher , abdurraheem green , whose internet lectures receive hundreds of thousands of hits , preaches that " islam is not compatible with democracy " and that to prevent a wife committing " evil " a husband has the right to " apply some type of physical force ... a very light beating " - though he says this should not leave any marks .
problem or solution despite these conservative views the metropolitan police has sought abdurraheem green 's advice recently .
one thing i have been very consistent on is terrorism , participating in terrorist activities , violent revolution - is not something that i have ever thought was part of the religion of islam abdurraheem green and the preacher himself insists that in spite of his conservative views about life in britain he is " part of the solution " to extremism because young people listen to him .
" i surely have said some pretty radical things and maybe even written some radical things in the past , " he told panorama .
" but one thing i have been very consistent on is terrorism , participating in terrorist activities , violent revolution - is not something that i have ever thought was part of the religion of islam . "
some senior police officers argue it is vital to work with radicals because they have credibility amongst young british muslims .
but some moderate scholars warn this is a dangerous road .
sheikh musa admani , imam at london metropolitan university , says if advice is sought from the radicals , or if they are funded with public money , then " muslims are going to endorse them as a whole and so there 's the danger " .

sinn fein junior minister gerry kelly speaking on hardtalk a plan to give £ 12,000 to the relatives of all those killed in the northern ireland troubles is a mistake , according to sinn fein 's gerry kelly .
the recommendation was made in a report compiled by a group set up to advise on how to deal with the past .
but the report , published by lord eames and denis bradley last month , sparked anger from some victims ' families .
mr kelly told the bbc 's hardtalk programme that the proposal had caused too much controversy .
" in fairness to eames-bradley , no-one said that it was in compensation or anything like that , " said mr kelly .
" they said it was in acknowledgement of the suffering across the board .
i think personally that it was a mistake .
" it 's easy in hindsight to say that , but clearly it was a mistake because it caused so much controversy .
" the real issue is that there has to be truth . "
the 190-page report , which contains more than 30 recommendations , is being considered by the government .
but unionists and some victims ' groups have rejected the proposed payment because it would include the families of republican and loyalist paramilitaries .
lord eames said it was time for a " final step out of the conflict by dealing with the legacy of the past " .
denis bradley said the report could address " the calls for justice , the pleas for truth " .
hardtalk will be broadcast on tuesday night on the bbc news channel at 2330 gmt .

sinn fein junior minister gerry kelly speaking on hardtalk a plan to give £ 12,000 to the relatives of all those killed in the northern ireland troubles is a mistake , according to sinn fein 's gerry kelly .
the recommendation was made in a report compiled by a group set up to advise on how to deal with the past .
but the report , published by lord eames and denis bradley last month , sparked anger from some victims ' families .
mr kelly told the bbc 's hardtalk programme that the proposal had caused too much controversy .
" in fairness to eames-bradley , no-one said that it was in compensation or anything like that , " said mr kelly .
" they said it was in acknowledgement of the suffering across the board .
i think personally that it was a mistake .
" it 's easy in hindsight to say that , but clearly it was a mistake because it caused so much controversy .
" the real issue is that there has to be truth . "
the 190-page report , which contains more than 30 recommendations , is being considered by the government .
but unionists and some victims ' groups have rejected the proposed payment because it would include the families of republican and loyalist paramilitaries .
lord eames said it was time for a " final step out of the conflict by dealing with the legacy of the past " .
denis bradley said the report could address " the calls for justice , the pleas for truth " .
hardtalk will be broadcast on tuesday night on the bbc news channel at 2330 gmt .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- mobile tech conference kicks off bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 09:03 gmt , monday , 16 february 2009 mobile tech conference kicks off by jason palmer science and technology reporter , bbc news , barcelona software and services will be the focus of the year 's biggest conference dedicated to mobile technology .
the mobile world congress convenes in barcelona with the industry undergoing negative growth .
the rising stars of the industry are tipped to be in areas surrounding mobile broadband and applications for devices such as cloud computing .
but there will also be announcements of new handsets and mobile gadgets .
the economic downturn is likely to be a dominant theme of discussion .
but the sense of a downturn for the mobile industry was made more tangible when nokia - the leader among handset manufacturers - recently announced it foresaw a 10 % fall in mobile phone sales for the coming year .
nokia itself saw its sales fall by 15 % from 2007 to 2008 , with the fifth largest manufacturer motorola suffering a 53 % drop during the same period .
but that is not to say that the industry as a whole will suffer .
even if fewer people are buying handsets , analysts say the market for software and services based on mobile devices may be recession-proof .
the number of attendees at this year 's congress is down by 10 % , but michael o 'hara , chief marketing officer for the gsm association - the umbrella organisation representing the mobile communications industry worldwide that hosts the congress - remains hopeful. dot.life blog " it seems using a mobile just to make a call is now very old hat , so expect more all-singing all-dancing phones-that-think-they 're-computers " bbc technology correspondent rory cellan-jones read more on the dot.life blog mr o 'hara points to the spectacular growth of mobile broadband as a sign that parts of the industry have no cause for concern .
" we are going to hear a lot of discussion about how to find your way out of an economic crisis , " mr o 'hara told bbc news .
" but i think you are going to hear that this is n't an industry looking for bailouts , it 's an industry ready to invest . "
next steps there are currently almost 100 million subscribers to mobile broadband , and the gsm 's estimates put that number at over a billion by 2012 . "
every time we have a technology transition period , a number of players do n't make it " bengt nordstrom , northstream as a consequence , one of the biggest talking points at the show is expected to be infrastructure .
the current 3g infrastructure is seeing the end of a 10-year cycle , with a few isolated markets signing up to one potential successor , known as long term evolution -lrb- lte -rrb- .
the high-speed packet access -lrb- hspa -rrb- infrastructure that currently drives mobile broadband can support data rates of up to 7.2 megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- , and the next generation , known as hspa + , could drive that number up to more than 20 mbps .
hspa + will be implemented in a number of markets worldwide later in 2009 .
lte promises speeds of up to 100mbps - but requires major changes in the cellular base stations that would support it .
that level of investment is a tricky proposition for mobile network operators navigating in uncertain economic times .
and it is not a matter of being first to the post with that kind of speed said bengt nordstrom , chief executive of mobile consultancy firm northstream .
" i have n't seen a case where anyone benefits by being the first to adopt a new technology - they are just guinea pigs for the rest of the industry , " said mr nordstrom .
" every time we have a technology transition period , a number of players do n't make it , and that 's probably the case this time as well . "
mind the apps the conference will of course host all the major players in the industry - with the notable exception of apple .
but at showstoppers , a pre-congress show-and-tell , a look at the smaller names points to a trend in which applications and services for mobile devices could become a major breadwinner for the industry .
the fully-connected , multimedia nature of handsets means they contain an ever richer mixture of personal and organisational data , and the ability to move , share , backup , and update that data across devices and " in the cloud " is another evident focus among some of the companies here .
and the mobile browser war continues , with plenty of options available from makers large and small alike - and a growing trend toward browsers and software based on open-source code .
while the success of apple 's software marketplace , the appstore , is expected to inspire many to follow suit .
the prospect of more applications marketplaces , in which both professional and amateur software developers can sell or give away applications for phones , is spreading widely throughout the industry , and there is much discussion about such giants as microsoft and nokia joining the fray .
" if you put a wide range of smartphones on a desk and step away two metres , it 's very hard to tell them apart - so that 's why software will be crucial in going forward , " said mr nordstrom .
despite these shifts toward more software and services within the industry , no mobile world congress would be complete without the release of some new handsets , and all the big manufacturers are here .
among the more notable releases , palm 's new offering the pre will make waves , and computer manufacturer acer will enter the market with a handset .
some manufacturers have made their releases ahead of the congress , such as the lg arena , and nokia 's 5800 came out weeks ago to make room for the n73 launch that will happen here .

even if fewer people are buying handsets , analysts say the market for software and services based on mobile devices may be recession-proof .

" we are going to hear a lot of discussion about how to find your way out of an economic crisis , " mr o 'hara told bbc news .
" but i think you are going to hear that this is n't an industry looking for bailouts , it 's an industry ready to invest . "

while the success of apple 's software marketplace , the appstore , is expected to inspire many to follow suit .
the prospect of more applications marketplaces , in which both professional and amateur software developers can sell or give away applications for phones , is spreading widely throughout the industry , and there is much discussion about such giants as microsoft and nokia joining the fray .
" if you put a wide range of smartphones on a desk and step away two metres , it 's very hard to tell them apart - so that 's why software will be crucial in going forward , " said mr nordstrom .
despite these shifts toward more software and services within the industry , no mobile world congress would be complete without the release of some new handsets , and all the big manufacturers are here .
among the more notable releases , palm 's new offering the pre will make waves , and computer manufacturer acer will enter the market with a handset .
some manufacturers have made their releases ahead of the congress , such as the lg arena , and nokia 's 5800 came out weeks ago to make room for the n73 launch that will happen here .

the mobile world congress convenes in barcelona with the industry undergoing negative growth .
the rising stars of the industry are tipped to be in areas surrounding mobile broadband and applications for devices such as cloud computing .
but there will also be announcements of new handsets and mobile gadgets .
the economic downturn is likely to be a dominant theme of discussion .
but the sense of a downturn for the mobile industry was made more tangible when nokia - the leader among handset manufacturers - recently announced it foresaw a 10 % fall in mobile phone sales for the coming year .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
advertisement the mobile world congress expects almost 50,000 visitors nokia itself saw its sales fall by 15 % from 2007 to 2008 , with the fifth largest manufacturer motorola suffering a 53 % drop during the same period .
but that is not to say that the industry as a whole will suffer .
even if fewer people are buying handsets , analysts say the market for software and services based on mobile devices may be recession-proof .
the number of attendees at this year 's congress is down by 10 % , but michael o 'hara , chief marketing officer for the gsm association - the umbrella organisation representing the mobile communications industry worldwide that hosts the congress - remains hopeful. dot.life blog it seems using a mobile just to make a call is now very old hat , so expect more all-singing all-dancing phones-that-think-they 're-computers bbc technology correspondent rory cellan-jones read more on the dot.life blog mr o 'hara points to the spectacular growth of mobile broadband as a sign that parts of the industry have no cause for concern .
" we are going to hear a lot of discussion about how to find your way out of an economic crisis , " mr o 'hara told bbc news .
" but i think you are going to hear that this is n't an industry looking for bailouts , it 's an industry ready to invest . "
next steps there are currently almost 100 million subscribers to mobile broadband , and the gsm 's estimates put that number at over a billion by 2012 .
every time we have a technology transition period , a number of players do n't make it bengt nordstrom , northstream as a consequence , one of the biggest talking points at the show is expected to be infrastructure .
the current 3g infrastructure is seeing the end of a 10-year cycle , with a few isolated markets signing up to one potential successor , known as long term evolution -lrb- lte -rrb- .
the high-speed packet access -lrb- hspa -rrb- infrastructure that currently drives mobile broadband can support data rates of up to 7.2 megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- , and the next generation , known as hspa + , could drive that number up to more than 20 mbps .
hspa + will be implemented in a number of markets worldwide later in 2009 .
lte promises speeds of up to 100mbps - but requires major changes in the cellular base stations that would support it .
that level of investment is a tricky proposition for mobile network operators navigating in uncertain economic times .
and it is not a matter of being first to the post with that kind of speed said bengt nordstrom , chief executive of mobile consultancy firm northstream .
" i have n't seen a case where anyone benefits by being the first to adopt a new technology - they are just guinea pigs for the rest of the industry , " said mr nordstrom .
" every time we have a technology transition period , a number of players do n't make it , and that 's probably the case this time as well . "
mind the apps the conference will of course host all the major players in the industry - with the notable exception of apple .
but at showstoppers , a pre-congress show-and-tell , a look at the smaller names points to a trend in which applications and services for mobile devices could become a major breadwinner for the industry .
palm 's pre is expected to make waves in barcelona the fully-connected , multimedia nature of handsets means they contain an ever richer mixture of personal and organisational data , and the ability to move , share , backup , and update that data across devices and " in the cloud " is another evident focus among some of the companies here .
and the mobile browser war continues , with plenty of options available from makers large and small alike - and a growing trend toward browsers and software based on open-source code .
while the success of apple 's software marketplace , the appstore , is expected to inspire many to follow suit .
the prospect of more applications marketplaces , in which both professional and amateur software developers can sell or give away applications for phones , is spreading widely throughout the industry , and there is much discussion about such giants as microsoft and nokia joining the fray .
" if you put a wide range of smartphones on a desk and step away two metres , it 's very hard to tell them apart - so that 's why software will be crucial in going forward , " said mr nordstrom .
despite these shifts toward more software and services within the industry , no mobile world congress would be complete without the release of some new handsets , and all the big manufacturers are here .
among the more notable releases , palm 's new offering the pre will make waves , and computer manufacturer acer will enter the market with a handset .
some manufacturers have made their releases ahead of the congress , such as the lg arena , and nokia 's 5800 came out weeks ago to make room for the n73 launch that will happen here .

"
when president chavez came out on the balcony to greet them , he was jubilant .
without a constitutional change he would have had to stand down when his term expires in 2013 ; instead he had secured the right to stand again for office in the next elections due in 2012 , and elections beyond .
" i am ready ! "
he told them .
" with today 's victory we start the third historical cycle of the bolivarian revolution , from 2009 to 2019 . "
this has been a crucial victory for venezuela 's president .
he had a lot riding on the outcome , both personally and politically .
he told voters that his destiny was in their hands and that he would respect their decision , win or lose .
in the end though , he won comfortably , further strengthening his argument that he has the backing of the majority of the venezuelan people .
a lot can happen in four years and the road to the 2012 election may well be rocky the opposition argued that the entire vote was unconstitutional , and unnecessary .
having defeated a similar reform in 2007 their campaign slogan was : " no means no ! "
but it is clear that the majority of voters did not agree .
rather , the government was able to persuade people that what president chavez called a " small change " to the constitution was important for the country 's future .
but what will happen when the smoke of the government 's celebratory fireworks clears ?
venezuela is facing a series of economic and social problems which need urgent attention , one of which , the rise in violent crime , has been almost taboo for the chavez government in recent years .
government members have questioned the severity of the problem and raised doubts about the murder rate figures .
social spending but in his victory speech , mr chavez identified the civil security situation as one of his priorities for the rest of his current term in office .
he also promised to " strengthen " the social programmes known as misiones , which provide free healthcare and education in some of the country 's poorest areas .
many economists say though that the next few years will be key as to whether he can sustain his level of social spending .
venezuelans are being promised improved social programmes with oil currently around $ 40 a barrel , mr chavez will not be able to depend on the huge oil revenues he enjoyed during the earlier part of last year .
inflation in venezuela is already the highest in latin america at just under 30 % a year and there are suggestions that the state-run energy company , pdvsa , is running at a severe loss .
while venezuelans have shown with this vote that president chavez still has more than enough support to win another presidential election , a lot can happen in four years and the road to the 2012 election may well be rocky .
but for now , none of that matters to the celebrating " chavistas " - the president 's core supporters .
they are just happy to have now secured the change which had eluded them so narrowly a year ago .
