the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .

several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .

over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "

african union foreign ministers have voted to suspend cooperation with the international criminal court over its indictment of sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir . after bitter wrangling , the leaders of the 53-member african union have agreed to denounce the international criminal court in the hague and defy the arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir has the african union behind him .
in a debate that cast the icc in the role of a toothless stooge of ex-colonial powers , the au leaders voted not to cooperate in the arrest and transfer of sudan 's president to the icc .
they argued that the indictment and arrest warrant for war crimes committed during fighting in sudan 's darfur region could compromise peace efforts in darfur .
several countries were not happy with the final document .
former south african president thabo mbeki is chairing an au panel responsible for bringing peace to darfur by making recommendations to the au 's peace and security council , as an alternative to the icc indictment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will justice be done ?
according to international experts , 200,000 people have died and more than 2.5 million have been driven from their homes in the country 's remote western region since mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
khartoum puts the death toll at just 10,000 .
prior to the decision , new york-based campaign group human rights watch said that if the au approved the draft resolution , the 30 african states who have signed up to the icc would be violating their legal obligations .
meanwhile , it became known that armed men have seized two female aid workers , one irish and one ugandan , in sudan 's darfur region .
it is the third kidnapping of foreign aid workers in the territory in the past four months. ch / reuters / ap / afp editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the missile launches are in direct violation of un resolutions on the country 's use of weapons . russia , china and the us have all called for calm after north korea said it test-fired seven missiles off its eastern coast , further raising tensions in the region .
it was the largest barrage of ballistic missiles launched by pyongyang since 2006 . china and russia called for a return to six-party talks , while the us urged the north not to " aggravate tensions . "
south korea and japan meanwhile have condemned the tests as “ a serious act of provocation ” and a " threat to regional security . " south korea 's defense ministry confirmed that north korea had fired seventh missiles over a period of just more than eight hours .
" it is a provocative act that clearly violates un security council resolutions , " a statement from the ministry said .
japan said the missiles were a " serious act of provocation against the security of neighboring countries . "
it 's believed the missiles were ' scud-type ' , which are included in the list of ballistic missiles the un has banned north korea from using . north korea is thought to have more than 600 scud-type missiles .
saturday 's launches come after north korea fired four short-range , non-ballistic missiles on thursday .

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cycling -pipe- 04.07.2009 spain 's contador seeks second tour de france title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto contador leads the astana team and is one of the favorites to win the tour de france alberto contador is back after missing last year 's tour de france .
the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uci is planning over 500 doping control tests during the tour the effects of doping have caused severe damage to the sport and the tour de france over the past few years .
in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .
one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .

in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .

the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

german bank ikb says it has obtained fresh german government guarantees worth seven billion euros to keep it liquid . the aid to the struggling bank has come from the german government 's banking rescue agency , soffin , but the european commission must still give regulatory clearance .
the help increases the total scope of government guarantees to ikb to 12 billion euros .
the dusseldorf-based bank said in a statement that its balance-sheet loss in the year to march 31 , 2009 amounted to 580 million euros .
that compares with an 11 million euro loss the previous year .
the bank , which was the first german casualty of the structured-finance debacle , lends to small industry .
the financial crisis in 2007 was the beginning of ikb 's slide , and last year the bank was sold to lone star , a us private-equity fund , for a knock-down price .
as a condition for state aid , ikb was required to shrink its business , which will mean a cut of one-fifth of its payroll. ch / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 04.07.2009 obama to mend fences in russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new prospects for us-russia relations ?
barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

the missile launches are in direct violation of un resolutions on the country 's use of weapons . russia , china and the us have all called for calm after north korea said it test-fired seven missiles off its eastern coast , further raising tensions in the region .
it was the largest barrage of ballistic missiles launched by pyongyang since 2006 . china and russia called for a return to six-party talks , while the us urged the north not to " aggravate tensions . "
south korea and japan meanwhile have condemned the tests as “ a serious act of provocation ” and a " threat to regional security . " south korea 's defense ministry confirmed that north korea had fired seventh missiles over a period of just more than eight hours .
" it is a provocative act that clearly violates un security council resolutions , " a statement from the ministry said .
japan said the missiles were a " serious act of provocation against the security of neighboring countries . "
it 's believed the missiles were ' scud-type ' , which are included in the list of ballistic missiles the un has banned north korea from using . north korea is thought to have more than 600 scud-type missiles .
saturday 's launches come after north korea fired four short-range , non-ballistic missiles on thursday .

observers believe the test-firings were timed to coincide with independence day celebrations in the us .

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

african union foreign ministers have voted to suspend cooperation with the international criminal court over its indictment of sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir . after bitter wrangling , the leaders of the 53-member african union have agreed to denounce the international criminal court in the hague and defy the arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir has the african union behind him .
in a debate that cast the icc in the role of a toothless stooge of ex-colonial powers , the au leaders voted not to cooperate in the arrest and transfer of sudan 's president to the icc .
they argued that the indictment and arrest warrant for war crimes committed during fighting in sudan 's darfur region could compromise peace efforts in darfur .
several countries were not happy with the final document .
former south african president thabo mbeki is chairing an au panel responsible for bringing peace to darfur by making recommendations to the au 's peace and security council , as an alternative to the icc indictment .

according to international experts , 200,000 people have died and more than 2.5 million have been driven from their homes in the country 's remote western region since mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
khartoum puts the death toll at just 10,000 .
prior to the decision , new york-based campaign group human rights watch said that if the au approved the draft resolution , the 30 african states who have signed up to the icc would be violating their legal obligations .
meanwhile , it became known that armed men have seized two female aid workers , one irish and one ugandan , in sudan 's darfur region .
it is the third kidnapping of foreign aid workers in the territory in the past four months. ch / reuters / ap / afp editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the defect caused a sudden drop in voltage which , in turn , blacked out between 1,500 and 1,800 traffic lights in germany 's second-largest city of hamburg and darkened a number of shopping malls .
there were also power cuts last wednesday thought to have been caused by a transformer problem at the plant .
safety versus energy security kruemmel only re-opened less than two weeks ago after a two-year shutdown triggered by a fire .
the 2007 fire which was caused by a short circuit , and other incidents at vattenfall 's brunsbuettel power plant in the same year , fueled a fierce debate in germany about the safety of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no radioactivity was released by the fire , but concerns remain the german government and four companies operating nuclear power plants in the country subsequently agreed to tighter safety standards .
when kruemmel re-opened in june , vattenfall said the plant , which generates about 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year , had been thoroughly modernized and that this would reduce the likelihood of a future incident .
in 2000 , germany decided to mothball its 17 reactors by the year 2020 .
however , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu / csu conservative bloc has for some time been calling for a re-assessment of that policy decision , arguing that germany 's dependence on foreign energy made nuclear power indispensable. gb / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the e-mail sent to germany , spiegel says , the captain said his crew was physically and emotionally exhausted .
" we are at the end of our rope , " he was reportedly to have said in the message .
the pirates had stolen all the belongings of the 24 seamen , many of the crew was sick , the pirates had taped their eyes shut and fired gunshots over their heads , the captain wrote .

african union foreign ministers have voted to suspend cooperation with the international criminal court over its indictment of sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir . after bitter wrangling , the leaders of the 53-member african union have agreed to denounce the international criminal court in the hague and defy the arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir has the african union behind him .
in a debate that cast the icc in the role of a toothless stooge of ex-colonial powers , the au leaders voted not to cooperate in the arrest and transfer of sudan 's president to the icc .
they argued that the indictment and arrest warrant for war crimes committed during fighting in sudan 's darfur region could compromise peace efforts in darfur .
several countries were not happy with the final document .
former south african president thabo mbeki is chairing an au panel responsible for bringing peace to darfur by making recommendations to the au 's peace and security council , as an alternative to the icc indictment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will justice be done ?
according to international experts , 200,000 people have died and more than 2.5 million have been driven from their homes in the country 's remote western region since mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
khartoum puts the death toll at just 10,000 .
prior to the decision , new york-based campaign group human rights watch said that if the au approved the draft resolution , the 30 african states who have signed up to the icc would be violating their legal obligations .
meanwhile , it became known that armed men have seized two female aid workers , one irish and one ugandan , in sudan 's darfur region .
it is the third kidnapping of foreign aid workers in the territory in the past four months. ch / reuters / ap / afp editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uci is planning over 500 doping control tests during the tour the effects of doping have caused severe damage to the sport and the tour de france over the past few years .
in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .
one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is good news - at least for peole in industrial countries .
but during a who swine flu summit , which wrapped up on friday in cancun , mexico , chan said that laboratories with capacity to produce the vaccine are mostly located in europe .
experts say this could have dire consequences for poor countries , especially those in the southern hemisphere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tourists have stayed away , but the who meeting has brought some trade to cancun .
90 % of projected stocks committed to rich countries jon kim andrus , an expert from the pan american health organization -lrb- paho -rrb- , said that 90 percent of the vaccine is already commited to high income countries , where some 893 million people live , and 10 percent to countries like china and russia , which can produce some of the vaccines themselves .
" if they began marketing the vaccine right now , developing countries would not get any , " andrus said at the cancun summit .
spain 's health minister , trinidad jimenez , called for the who , together with the european union , to reserve a portion of vaccine stock to be purchased for developing countries .
" we can not allow a massive reservation of stocks for purchase by a few countries , " said jimenez .
spain will not be able to build a laboratory capable of producing a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccines until 2012 .
the who and paho are negotiating with vaccine producers to secure donations or sales at lower prices for developing countries .
richer nations are being asked to share some of their vaccine stocks .
the who director general chan said two companies had agreed to manufacture 250 million doses to be sent to developing countries , but she also acknowledged that the amount " is obviously not enough . "

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uci is planning over 500 doping control tests during the tour the effects of doping have caused severe damage to the sport and the tour de france over the past few years .
in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .
one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is good news - at least for peole in industrial countries .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tourists have stayed away , but the who meeting has brought some trade to cancun .
90 % of projected stocks committed to rich countries jon kim andrus , an expert from the pan american health organization -lrb- paho -rrb- , said that 90 percent of the vaccine is already commited to high income countries , where some 893 million people live , and 10 percent to countries like china and russia , which can produce some of the vaccines themselves .
" if they began marketing the vaccine right now , developing countries would not get any , " andrus said at the cancun summit .
spain 's health minister , trinidad jimenez , called for the who , together with the european union , to reserve a portion of vaccine stock to be purchased for developing countries .
" we can not allow a massive reservation of stocks for purchase by a few countries , " said jimenez .
spain will not be able to build a laboratory capable of producing a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccines until 2012 .
the who and paho are negotiating with vaccine producers to secure donations or sales at lower prices for developing countries .
richer nations are being asked to share some of their vaccine stocks .
the who director general chan said two companies had agreed to manufacture 250 million doses to be sent to developing countries , but she also acknowledged that the amount " is obviously not enough . "

three people have died in britain so far from the virus .
mexican health minister jose angel cordova called for " solidarity so that money is not the only factor in producer decisions about the distribution of the vaccine . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cycling -pipe- 04.07.2009 spain 's contador seeks second tour de france title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto contador leads the astana team and is one of the favorites to win the tour de france alberto contador is back after missing last year 's tour de france .
the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uci is planning over 500 doping control tests during the tour the effects of doping have caused severe damage to the sport and the tour de france over the past few years .
in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .
one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

south korea and japan meanwhile have condemned the tests as “ a serious act of provocation ” and a " threat to regional security . " south korea 's defense ministry confirmed that north korea had fired seventh missiles over a period of just more than eight hours .
" it is a provocative act that clearly violates un security council resolutions , " a statement from the ministry said .
japan said the missiles were a " serious act of provocation against the security of neighboring countries . "
it 's believed the missiles were ' scud-type ' , which are included in the list of ballistic missiles the un has banned north korea from using . north korea is thought to have more than 600 scud-type missiles .
saturday 's launches come after north korea fired four short-range , non-ballistic missiles on thursday .
tensions between north korea and its neighbors increased recently after the north carried out a nuclear test .
observers believe the test-firings were timed to coincide with independence day celebrations in the us .

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uci is planning over 500 doping control tests during the tour the effects of doping have caused severe damage to the sport and the tour de france over the past few years .
in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .
one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "

" if they began marketing the vaccine right now , developing countries would not get any , " andrus said at the cancun summit .
spain 's health minister , trinidad jimenez , called for the who , together with the european union , to reserve a portion of vaccine stock to be purchased for developing countries .
" we can not allow a massive reservation of stocks for purchase by a few countries , " said jimenez .
spain will not be able to build a laboratory capable of producing a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccines until 2012 .
the who and paho are negotiating with vaccine producers to secure donations or sales at lower prices for developing countries .
richer nations are being asked to share some of their vaccine stocks .
the who director general chan said two companies had agreed to manufacture 250 million doses to be sent to developing countries , but she also acknowledged that the amount " is obviously not enough . "
chan said that while the first vaccines may be ready in august , recommendations for use may take awhile longer .
she urged rich countries not to hoarde future vaccine stocks .
chinese want to go it alone china wants to be self-sufficient in vaccine production , chinese health minister zhu chen said on the summit sidelines on friday , and plans to have a vaccine available by september .

british health officials say they have abandoned attempts to stop the flu spreading , instead focusing on those who are most susceptible , such as the obese or those with asthma or other respiratory conditions .
three people have died in britain so far from the virus .
mexican health minister jose angel cordova called for " solidarity so that money is not the only factor in producer decisions about the distribution of the vaccine . "
mexico was the epicenter of the pandemic and remains the second worst-affected country after the united states .
to date , at least 337 people have died around the world from swine flu , which has infected 80,000 people in 121 countries. ch / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is good news - at least for peole in industrial countries .
but during a who swine flu summit , which wrapped up on friday in cancun , mexico , chan said that laboratories with capacity to produce the vaccine are mostly located in europe .
experts say this could have dire consequences for poor countries , especially those in the southern hemisphere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tourists have stayed away , but the who meeting has brought some trade to cancun .
90 % of projected stocks committed to rich countries jon kim andrus , an expert from the pan american health organization -lrb- paho -rrb- , said that 90 percent of the vaccine is already commited to high income countries , where some 893 million people live , and 10 percent to countries like china and russia , which can produce some of the vaccines themselves .
" if they began marketing the vaccine right now , developing countries would not get any , " andrus said at the cancun summit .
spain 's health minister , trinidad jimenez , called for the who , together with the european union , to reserve a portion of vaccine stock to be purchased for developing countries .
" we can not allow a massive reservation of stocks for purchase by a few countries , " said jimenez .
spain will not be able to build a laboratory capable of producing a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccines until 2012 .
the who and paho are negotiating with vaccine producers to secure donations or sales at lower prices for developing countries .
richer nations are being asked to share some of their vaccine stocks .
the who director general chan said two companies had agreed to manufacture 250 million doses to be sent to developing countries , but she also acknowledged that the amount " is obviously not enough . "
chan said that while the first vaccines may be ready in august , recommendations for use may take awhile longer .
she urged rich countries not to hoarde future vaccine stocks .
chinese want to go it alone china wants to be self-sufficient in vaccine production , chinese health minister zhu chen said on the summit sidelines on friday , and plans to have a vaccine available by september .
the chinese minister said that some public companies in china are in the initial manufacturing process of a vaccine and that a preliminary version is likely to be ready by the end of this month .

with nearly 7,500 cases of swine flu , the country has already been hit hardest in europe .
british health officials say they have abandoned attempts to stop the flu spreading , instead focusing on those who are most susceptible , such as the obese or those with asthma or other respiratory conditions .
three people have died in britain so far from the virus .
mexican health minister jose angel cordova called for " solidarity so that money is not the only factor in producer decisions about the distribution of the vaccine . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 04.07.2009 nuclear plant shuts down after second mishap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kruemmel was back on line after a two-year pause a controversial german nuclear power plant at the center of a national energy debate has been forced to shut down again following a second mishap . the swedish-owned electric utility , vattenfall , which operates the kruemmel nuclear power station in northern germany , said it turned off the reactor on saturday after a problem with one of the power plant 's two machinery transformers .
the defect caused a sudden drop in voltage which , in turn , blacked out between 1,500 and 1,800 traffic lights in germany 's second-largest city of hamburg and darkened a number of shopping malls .
there were also power cuts last wednesday thought to have been caused by a transformer problem at the plant .
safety versus energy security kruemmel only re-opened less than two weeks ago after a two-year shutdown triggered by a fire .
the 2007 fire which was caused by a short circuit , and other incidents at vattenfall 's brunsbuettel power plant in the same year , fueled a fierce debate in germany about the safety of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no radioactivity was released by the fire , but concerns remain the german government and four companies operating nuclear power plants in the country subsequently agreed to tighter safety standards .
when kruemmel re-opened in june , vattenfall said the plant , which generates about 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year , had been thoroughly modernized and that this would reduce the likelihood of a future incident .
in 2000 , germany decided to mothball its 17 reactors by the year 2020 .
however , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu / csu conservative bloc has for some time been calling for a re-assessment of that policy decision , arguing that germany 's dependence on foreign energy made nuclear power indispensable. gb / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there were also power cuts last wednesday thought to have been caused by a transformer problem at the plant .
safety versus energy security kruemmel only re-opened less than two weeks ago after a two-year shutdown triggered by a fire .
the 2007 fire which was caused by a short circuit , and other incidents at vattenfall 's brunsbuettel power plant in the same year , fueled a fierce debate in germany about the safety of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no radioactivity was released by the fire , but concerns remain the german government and four companies operating nuclear power plants in the country subsequently agreed to tighter safety standards .
when kruemmel re-opened in june , vattenfall said the plant , which generates about 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year , had been thoroughly modernized and that this would reduce the likelihood of a future incident .
in 2000 , germany decided to mothball its 17 reactors by the year 2020 .

it 's believed the missiles were ' scud-type ' , which are included in the list of ballistic missiles the un has banned north korea from using . north korea is thought to have more than 600 scud-type missiles .
saturday 's launches come after north korea fired four short-range , non-ballistic missiles on thursday .

the defect caused a sudden drop in voltage which , in turn , blacked out between 1,500 and 1,800 traffic lights in germany 's second-largest city of hamburg and darkened a number of shopping malls .
there were also power cuts last wednesday thought to have been caused by a transformer problem at the plant .
safety versus energy security kruemmel only re-opened less than two weeks ago after a two-year shutdown triggered by a fire .
the 2007 fire which was caused by a short circuit , and other incidents at vattenfall 's brunsbuettel power plant in the same year , fueled a fierce debate in germany about the safety of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no radioactivity was released by the fire , but concerns remain the german government and four companies operating nuclear power plants in the country subsequently agreed to tighter safety standards .
when kruemmel re-opened in june , vattenfall said the plant , which generates about 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year , had been thoroughly modernized and that this would reduce the likelihood of a future incident .
in 2000 , germany decided to mothball its 17 reactors by the year 2020 .
however , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu / csu conservative bloc has for some time been calling for a re-assessment of that policy decision , arguing that germany 's dependence on foreign energy made nuclear power indispensable. gb / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .

i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "

african union foreign ministers have voted to suspend cooperation with the international criminal court over its indictment of sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir . after bitter wrangling , the leaders of the 53-member african union have agreed to denounce the international criminal court in the hague and defy the arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir has the african union behind him .
in a debate that cast the icc in the role of a toothless stooge of ex-colonial powers , the au leaders voted not to cooperate in the arrest and transfer of sudan 's president to the icc .
they argued that the indictment and arrest warrant for war crimes committed during fighting in sudan 's darfur region could compromise peace efforts in darfur .
several countries were not happy with the final document .
former south african president thabo mbeki is chairing an au panel responsible for bringing peace to darfur by making recommendations to the au 's peace and security council , as an alternative to the icc indictment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will justice be done ?
according to international experts , 200,000 people have died and more than 2.5 million have been driven from their homes in the country 's remote western region since mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
khartoum puts the death toll at just 10,000 .
prior to the decision , new york-based campaign group human rights watch said that if the au approved the draft resolution , the 30 african states who have signed up to the icc would be violating their legal obligations .
meanwhile , it became known that armed men have seized two female aid workers , one irish and one ugandan , in sudan 's darfur region .
it is the third kidnapping of foreign aid workers in the territory in the past four months. ch / reuters / ap / afp editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's set to ratchet up tension in the already conflict-torn region .

african union foreign ministers have voted to suspend cooperation with the international criminal court over its indictment of sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir . after bitter wrangling , the leaders of the 53-member african union have agreed to denounce the international criminal court in the hague and defy the arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir has the african union behind him .
in a debate that cast the icc in the role of a toothless stooge of ex-colonial powers , the au leaders voted not to cooperate in the arrest and transfer of sudan 's president to the icc .
they argued that the indictment and arrest warrant for war crimes committed during fighting in sudan 's darfur region could compromise peace efforts in darfur .
several countries were not happy with the final document .
former south african president thabo mbeki is chairing an au panel responsible for bringing peace to darfur by making recommendations to the au 's peace and security council , as an alternative to the icc indictment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will justice be done ?
according to international experts , 200,000 people have died and more than 2.5 million have been driven from their homes in the country 's remote western region since mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
khartoum puts the death toll at just 10,000 .
prior to the decision , new york-based campaign group human rights watch said that if the au approved the draft resolution , the 30 african states who have signed up to the icc would be violating their legal obligations .
meanwhile , it became known that armed men have seized two female aid workers , one irish and one ugandan , in sudan 's darfur region .
it is the third kidnapping of foreign aid workers in the territory in the past four months. ch / reuters / ap / afp editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uci is planning over 500 doping control tests during the tour the effects of doping have caused severe damage to the sport and the tour de france over the past few years .
in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .
one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

that is good news - at least for peole in industrial countries .
but during a who swine flu summit , which wrapped up on friday in cancun , mexico , chan said that laboratories with capacity to produce the vaccine are mostly located in europe .
experts say this could have dire consequences for poor countries , especially those in the southern hemisphere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tourists have stayed away , but the who meeting has brought some trade to cancun .
90 % of projected stocks committed to rich countries jon kim andrus , an expert from the pan american health organization -lrb- paho -rrb- , said that 90 percent of the vaccine is already commited to high income countries , where some 893 million people live , and 10 percent to countries like china and russia , which can produce some of the vaccines themselves .
" if they began marketing the vaccine right now , developing countries would not get any , " andrus said at the cancun summit .
spain 's health minister , trinidad jimenez , called for the who , together with the european union , to reserve a portion of vaccine stock to be purchased for developing countries .
" we can not allow a massive reservation of stocks for purchase by a few countries , " said jimenez .
spain will not be able to build a laboratory capable of producing a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccines until 2012 .
the who and paho are negotiating with vaccine producers to secure donations or sales at lower prices for developing countries .
richer nations are being asked to share some of their vaccine stocks .
the who director general chan said two companies had agreed to manufacture 250 million doses to be sent to developing countries , but she also acknowledged that the amount " is obviously not enough . "
chan said that while the first vaccines may be ready in august , recommendations for use may take awhile longer .
she urged rich countries not to hoarde future vaccine stocks .
chinese want to go it alone china wants to be self-sufficient in vaccine production , chinese health minister zhu chen said on the summit sidelines on friday , and plans to have a vaccine available by september .
the chinese minister said that some public companies in china are in the initial manufacturing process of a vaccine and that a preliminary version is likely to be ready by the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus failed to read this sign in hong kong .
the virus is currently being treated with influenza drug tamiflu .
however cases of infection resistant to the drug have been reported in hong kong , denmark and japan .
great britain the worst affected in europe britain has warned it could face more than 100,000 cases of swine flu a day by the end of august , if the current infection rate is maintained .
with nearly 7,500 cases of swine flu , the country has already been hit hardest in europe .
british health officials say they have abandoned attempts to stop the flu spreading , instead focusing on those who are most susceptible , such as the obese or those with asthma or other respiratory conditions .
three people have died in britain so far from the virus .
mexican health minister jose angel cordova called for " solidarity so that money is not the only factor in producer decisions about the distribution of the vaccine . "
mexico was the epicenter of the pandemic and remains the second worst-affected country after the united states .
to date , at least 337 people have died around the world from swine flu , which has infected 80,000 people in 121 countries. ch / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

" if they began marketing the vaccine right now , developing countries would not get any , " andrus said at the cancun summit .
spain 's health minister , trinidad jimenez , called for the who , together with the european union , to reserve a portion of vaccine stock to be purchased for developing countries .
" we can not allow a massive reservation of stocks for purchase by a few countries , " said jimenez .
spain will not be able to build a laboratory capable of producing a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccines until 2012 .
the who and paho are negotiating with vaccine producers to secure donations or sales at lower prices for developing countries .
richer nations are being asked to share some of their vaccine stocks .

with nearly 7,500 cases of swine flu , the country has already been hit hardest in europe .
british health officials say they have abandoned attempts to stop the flu spreading , instead focusing on those who are most susceptible , such as the obese or those with asthma or other respiratory conditions .
three people have died in britain so far from the virus .
mexican health minister jose angel cordova called for " solidarity so that money is not the only factor in producer decisions about the distribution of the vaccine . "

african union foreign ministers have voted to suspend cooperation with the international criminal court over its indictment of sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir . after bitter wrangling , the leaders of the 53-member african union have agreed to denounce the international criminal court in the hague and defy the arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's president omar hassan ahmad al-bashir has the african union behind him .
in a debate that cast the icc in the role of a toothless stooge of ex-colonial powers , the au leaders voted not to cooperate in the arrest and transfer of sudan 's president to the icc .
they argued that the indictment and arrest warrant for war crimes committed during fighting in sudan 's darfur region could compromise peace efforts in darfur .
several countries were not happy with the final document .
former south african president thabo mbeki is chairing an au panel responsible for bringing peace to darfur by making recommendations to the au 's peace and security council , as an alternative to the icc indictment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will justice be done ?
according to international experts , 200,000 people have died and more than 2.5 million have been driven from their homes in the country 's remote western region since mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
khartoum puts the death toll at just 10,000 .
prior to the decision , new york-based campaign group human rights watch said that if the au approved the draft resolution , the 30 african states who have signed up to the icc would be violating their legal obligations .
meanwhile , it became known that armed men have seized two female aid workers , one irish and one ugandan , in sudan 's darfur region .
it is the third kidnapping of foreign aid workers in the territory in the past four months. ch / reuters / ap / afp editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de icc issues warrant for sudanese president al-bashir 's arrest the international criminal court in the hague has ordered the indictment of sudanese president omar al-bashir over alleged war crimes in darfur .
that 's set to ratchet up tension in the already conflict-torn region .
-lrb- 04.03.2009 -rrb- opinion : bashir arrest warrant both symbolic and important the call for an arrest warrant against sudanese president omar al-bashir may just be a symbolic move , but bashir and his cronies will still have to react to the genocide charges , says dw 's stefanie duckstein .

german bank ikb says it has obtained fresh german government guarantees worth seven billion euros to keep it liquid . the aid to the struggling bank has come from the german government 's banking rescue agency , soffin , but the european commission must still give regulatory clearance .
the help increases the total scope of government guarantees to ikb to 12 billion euros .
the dusseldorf-based bank said in a statement that its balance-sheet loss in the year to march 31 , 2009 amounted to 580 million euros .
that compares with an 11 million euro loss the previous year .
the bank , which was the first german casualty of the structured-finance debacle , lends to small industry .
the financial crisis in 2007 was the beginning of ikb 's slide , and last year the bank was sold to lone star , a us private-equity fund , for a knock-down price .
as a condition for state aid , ikb was required to shrink its business , which will mean a cut of one-fifth of its payroll. ch / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is good news - at least for peole in industrial countries .

90 % of projected stocks committed to rich countries jon kim andrus , an expert from the pan american health organization -lrb- paho -rrb- , said that 90 percent of the vaccine is already commited to high income countries , where some 893 million people live , and 10 percent to countries like china and russia , which can produce some of the vaccines themselves .
" if they began marketing the vaccine right now , developing countries would not get any , " andrus said at the cancun summit .
spain 's health minister , trinidad jimenez , called for the who , together with the european union , to reserve a portion of vaccine stock to be purchased for developing countries .
" we can not allow a massive reservation of stocks for purchase by a few countries , " said jimenez .
spain will not be able to build a laboratory capable of producing a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccines until 2012 .
the who and paho are negotiating with vaccine producers to secure donations or sales at lower prices for developing countries .
richer nations are being asked to share some of their vaccine stocks .
the who director general chan said two companies had agreed to manufacture 250 million doses to be sent to developing countries , but she also acknowledged that the amount " is obviously not enough . "

three people have died in britain so far from the virus .
mexican health minister jose angel cordova called for " solidarity so that money is not the only factor in producer decisions about the distribution of the vaccine . "

the defect caused a sudden drop in voltage which , in turn , blacked out between 1,500 and 1,800 traffic lights in germany 's second-largest city of hamburg and darkened a number of shopping malls .
there were also power cuts last wednesday thought to have been caused by a transformer problem at the plant .
safety versus energy security kruemmel only re-opened less than two weeks ago after a two-year shutdown triggered by a fire .
the 2007 fire which was caused by a short circuit , and other incidents at vattenfall 's brunsbuettel power plant in the same year , fueled a fierce debate in germany about the safety of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no radioactivity was released by the fire , but concerns remain the german government and four companies operating nuclear power plants in the country subsequently agreed to tighter safety standards .
when kruemmel re-opened in june , vattenfall said the plant , which generates about 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year , had been thoroughly modernized and that this would reduce the likelihood of a future incident .
in 2000 , germany decided to mothball its 17 reactors by the year 2020 .
however , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu / csu conservative bloc has for some time been calling for a re-assessment of that policy decision , arguing that germany 's dependence on foreign energy made nuclear power indispensable. gb / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cycling -pipe- 04.07.2009 spain 's contador seeks second tour de france title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto contador leads the astana team and is one of the favorites to win the tour de france alberto contador is back after missing last year 's tour de france .
the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uci is planning over 500 doping control tests during the tour the effects of doping have caused severe damage to the sport and the tour de france over the past few years .
in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .
one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .

six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .

one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "

the defect caused a sudden drop in voltage which , in turn , blacked out between 1,500 and 1,800 traffic lights in germany 's second-largest city of hamburg and darkened a number of shopping malls .
there were also power cuts last wednesday thought to have been caused by a transformer problem at the plant .
safety versus energy security kruemmel only re-opened less than two weeks ago after a two-year shutdown triggered by a fire .
the 2007 fire which was caused by a short circuit , and other incidents at vattenfall 's brunsbuettel power plant in the same year , fueled a fierce debate in germany about the safety of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no radioactivity was released by the fire , but concerns remain the german government and four companies operating nuclear power plants in the country subsequently agreed to tighter safety standards .
when kruemmel re-opened in june , vattenfall said the plant , which generates about 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year , had been thoroughly modernized and that this would reduce the likelihood of a future incident .
in 2000 , germany decided to mothball its 17 reactors by the year 2020 .
however , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu / csu conservative bloc has for some time been calling for a re-assessment of that policy decision , arguing that germany 's dependence on foreign energy made nuclear power indispensable. gb / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the missile launches are in direct violation of un resolutions on the country 's use of weapons . russia , china and the us have all called for calm after north korea said it test-fired seven missiles off its eastern coast , further raising tensions in the region .
it was the largest barrage of ballistic missiles launched by pyongyang since 2006 . china and russia called for a return to six-party talks , while the us urged the north not to " aggravate tensions . "
south korea and japan meanwhile have condemned the tests as “ a serious act of provocation ” and a " threat to regional security . " south korea 's defense ministry confirmed that north korea had fired seventh missiles over a period of just more than eight hours .
" it is a provocative act that clearly violates un security council resolutions , " a statement from the ministry said .
japan said the missiles were a " serious act of provocation against the security of neighboring countries . "
it 's believed the missiles were ' scud-type ' , which are included in the list of ballistic missiles the un has banned north korea from using . north korea is thought to have more than 600 scud-type missiles .
saturday 's launches come after north korea fired four short-range , non-ballistic missiles on thursday .

that is good news - at least for peole in industrial countries .

experts say this could have dire consequences for poor countries , especially those in the southern hemisphere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tourists have stayed away , but the who meeting has brought some trade to cancun .
90 % of projected stocks committed to rich countries jon kim andrus , an expert from the pan american health organization -lrb- paho -rrb- , said that 90 percent of the vaccine is already commited to high income countries , where some 893 million people live , and 10 percent to countries like china and russia , which can produce some of the vaccines themselves .
" if they began marketing the vaccine right now , developing countries would not get any , " andrus said at the cancun summit .
spain 's health minister , trinidad jimenez , called for the who , together with the european union , to reserve a portion of vaccine stock to be purchased for developing countries .
" we can not allow a massive reservation of stocks for purchase by a few countries , " said jimenez .
spain will not be able to build a laboratory capable of producing a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccines until 2012 .
the who and paho are negotiating with vaccine producers to secure donations or sales at lower prices for developing countries .
richer nations are being asked to share some of their vaccine stocks .
the who director general chan said two companies had agreed to manufacture 250 million doses to be sent to developing countries , but she also acknowledged that the amount " is obviously not enough . "

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the defect caused a sudden drop in voltage which , in turn , blacked out between 1,500 and 1,800 traffic lights in germany 's second-largest city of hamburg and darkened a number of shopping malls .
there were also power cuts last wednesday thought to have been caused by a transformer problem at the plant .
safety versus energy security kruemmel only re-opened less than two weeks ago after a two-year shutdown triggered by a fire .
the 2007 fire which was caused by a short circuit , and other incidents at vattenfall 's brunsbuettel power plant in the same year , fueled a fierce debate in germany about the safety of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no radioactivity was released by the fire , but concerns remain the german government and four companies operating nuclear power plants in the country subsequently agreed to tighter safety standards .
when kruemmel re-opened in june , vattenfall said the plant , which generates about 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year , had been thoroughly modernized and that this would reduce the likelihood of a future incident .
in 2000 , germany decided to mothball its 17 reactors by the year 2020 .
however , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu / csu conservative bloc has for some time been calling for a re-assessment of that policy decision , arguing that germany 's dependence on foreign energy made nuclear power indispensable. gb / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german bank ikb says it has obtained fresh german government guarantees worth seven billion euros to keep it liquid . the aid to the struggling bank has come from the german government 's banking rescue agency , soffin , but the european commission must still give regulatory clearance .
the help increases the total scope of government guarantees to ikb to 12 billion euros .
the dusseldorf-based bank said in a statement that its balance-sheet loss in the year to march 31 , 2009 amounted to 580 million euros .
that compares with an 11 million euro loss the previous year .
the bank , which was the first german casualty of the structured-finance debacle , lends to small industry .
the financial crisis in 2007 was the beginning of ikb 's slide , and last year the bank was sold to lone star , a us private-equity fund , for a knock-down price .
as a condition for state aid , ikb was required to shrink its business , which will mean a cut of one-fifth of its payroll. ch / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "

german bank ikb says it has obtained fresh german government guarantees worth seven billion euros to keep it liquid . the aid to the struggling bank has come from the german government 's banking rescue agency , soffin , but the european commission must still give regulatory clearance .
the help increases the total scope of government guarantees to ikb to 12 billion euros .
the dusseldorf-based bank said in a statement that its balance-sheet loss in the year to march 31 , 2009 amounted to 580 million euros .
that compares with an 11 million euro loss the previous year .
the bank , which was the first german casualty of the structured-finance debacle , lends to small industry .
the financial crisis in 2007 was the beginning of ikb 's slide , and last year the bank was sold to lone star , a us private-equity fund , for a knock-down price .
as a condition for state aid , ikb was required to shrink its business , which will mean a cut of one-fifth of its payroll. ch / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the defect caused a sudden drop in voltage which , in turn , blacked out between 1,500 and 1,800 traffic lights in germany 's second-largest city of hamburg and darkened a number of shopping malls .

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uci is planning over 500 doping control tests during the tour the effects of doping have caused severe damage to the sport and the tour de france over the past few years .
in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .
one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .

the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cycling -pipe- 04.07.2009 spain 's contador seeks second tour de france title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto contador leads the astana team and is one of the favorites to win the tour de france alberto contador is back after missing last year 's tour de france .
the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uci is planning over 500 doping control tests during the tour the effects of doping have caused severe damage to the sport and the tour de france over the past few years .
in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .
one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cycling -pipe- 04.07.2009 spain 's contador seeks second tour de france title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alberto contador leads the astana team and is one of the favorites to win the tour de france alberto contador is back after missing last year 's tour de france .
the 2007 tour champ is a favorite to win but faces tough competition from his astana teammates - including lance armstrong - and germany 's best riders . contador won the tour de france in 2007 with the discovery channel team and is making his first appearance on the tour since then with khazakstan-based astana .
in 2008 , contador had joined astana , but the team was barred from participating in the tour due to a doping scandal from 2007 .
contador is one of the pre-race favorites , especially considering his support riders on the astana team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven-time winner lance armstrong returns to the tour de france contador has germany 's andreas kloeden and levi leipheimer of the us on his side , both previous podium finishers in the tour .
but his biggest co-star is american lance armstrong , who won seven consecutive tours before retiring in 2005 .
despite some speculation that armstrong could go after the tour title himself , his official role on the astana team is as a support rider for contador .
however , should contador falter , armstrong , kloeden , or leipheimer are capable of making a push for the yellow jersey themselves .
despite sitting out last year 's tour de france because of astana 's doping ban , contador still had a busy year .
he won the sport 's two other biggest races – the giro d 'italia and the tour of spain , becoming the fifth man ever to have won all three of cycling 's major competitions .
contador also won the spanish time trial title this year in june and won the tour of the basque country in april .
contador 's strengths are his climbing ability , but with his win at the spanish time trial , he 's proven to be a fast rider , too .
fewer german teams , but talent still remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linus gerdemann was a tour stage winner in 2007 with columbia , but now co-captains germany 's team milram andreas kloeden is n't the only german riding in this year 's tour de france .
six of german team milram 's nine riders are from germany .
the team is led by captains linus gerdemann and gerald ciolek .
gerdemann , 27 , wore the yellow jersey for part of the 2007 tour and claimed a stage victory , while ciolek , 22 , is a former world youth champion and sprint specialist with a good shot at the tour 's green sprinter 's jersey .
" the green jersey is certainly a realistic goal , " ciolek told german broadcaster wdr .
milram is the last remaining german team on tour .
long-time powerhouse t-mobile withdrew from the sport two years ago after numerous doping scandals , some involving german cycling legend and 1997 tour de france winner jan ullrich .
beverage company gerolsteiner pulled out of its team sponsorship at the end of last year as well .
the image of professional cycling in germany has certainly taken a hit over the past few years , but linus gerdemann says team milram hopes to push the sport in a new direction .
" everyone on team milram is aware of the gravity of the situation , " gerdemann told wdr .
" and we 're committed to riding clean and fair .
i hope we can do our part to improve the image of professional cycling . "
an additional german standout on the tour is tony martin , a 24-year-old prospect riding for american team colombia-highroad .
martin was dominant in the mountains at the tour of switzerland this year and came in second place overall .
extensive doping controls uci , international cycling 's governing body , has said that the 2009 tour de france will be one of the most heavily scrutinized sporting events ever in terms of doping control .
uci will work together with french anti-doping agency afld to conduct over 500 doping control tests during the three week race .
part of uci 's strategy includes biological passports for riders , which have been created over the past year by taking blood and urine samples to be used as a basis of comparison for samples taken during the tour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uci is planning over 500 doping control tests during the tour the effects of doping have caused severe damage to the sport and the tour de france over the past few years .
in 2006 , authorities in spain uncovered a major doping scandal , labelled operation puerto .
several riders were implicated on the eve of the tour , and riders are still feeling the effects three years later .
alejandro valverde was recently given a two-year ban from competing in italy after a blood sample from last year 's tour de france proved to be a dna match with blood samples associated with operation puerto .
one stage of the 2009 tour de france passes through italy , making valverde ineligible to compete . bildunterschrift : the 2009 tour de france begins on july 4 with a 15.5 kilometer time trial in monaco .
the tour includes additional diversions from france in spain , andorra , italy , and switzerland before wrapping up in paris on july 26 .
over the three-week race , 180 riders from 20 teams will compete in 10 flat stages , seven mountain stages , one medium mountain stage , one additional time trial , and one team time trial .
the winner of the race will effectively be decided after a punishing 21km ascent of mont ventoux on the second to last day of the tour . this is the first time in history that the last stage before paris will be a mountain stage .
the final day of the tour is a mostly ceremonial stage from montereau-fault-yonne to the finish line on the champs-elysees in paris. mz / reuters / dpa / ap / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

barack obama leaves sunday for his fourth major international trip .
he 'll hold extensive talks in russia , attend the g8 summit in italy , and visit ghana .
iran , the financial crisis , and climate change top his agenda . the us president is due to arrive in moscow on a visit to mend ties sorely tested by a series of political disputes and russia 's brief war with georgia last summer .
obama is expected to sign a transit deal for us military goods through russia to afghanistan and ink a framework accord on replacing a key cold war-era weapons treaty .
russian president dmitry medvedev on saturday said he was confident obama 's visit to moscow would open up new perspectives for us-russia relations .
" we expect that concrete results will be reached at the summit which will open up new prospects for the development of our relations , " medvedev said in a statement released by the kremlin to mark us independence day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on souveniers , medvedev and obama stand shoulder to shoulder " i sincerely hope that with our mutual efforts russia-us relations can be brought to a new level of quality , " the statement said .
the new york times on saturday reported that russia has agreed to allow american troops and weapons to fly over its airspace on the way to afghanistan .
it said the breakthrough was to be announced during obama 's visit to moscow .
the newspaper quoted unnamed officials from russia and the united states confirming the arrangement .
until now , russia has only allowed the us military to use rail transport across its territory on the way to afghanistan and to transport only nonlethal supplies .
g8 agenda will include iran and climate change obama 's next stop will be the g8 summit in l 'aquila , italy , the town devastated by an earthquake earlier this year .
iran and climate change will feature high on the agenda there , and it 's thought that the leaders may even impose sanctions on tehran , following its violent crackdown on post-election protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran and climate change will top the agenda at the g8 summit but , the g8 meets amid serious questions about whether it provides the best forum to deal with an unprecedented global recession , says analyst steven schrage of the center for strategic & international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
" i think even the most generous commentators on the g8 have often noted there 's not much follow up in areas like development or aid .
many of the agenda items are targeting the far distant future for action long after the current leaders will have been long into retirement . "
representatives from developing nations will also be on hand for some of the meetings , in a sign that the existing format , bringing the richest , most developed , nations together - will not be enough to tackle 21st century problems .
ghana as an african success story the last leg on obama 's travel itinerary is a visit to ghana , his first stop in sub-saharan africa as president .
he 's expected , for the first time , to outline his administration 's policy approach to the continent , with emphasis on promoting good governance , democracy and food security .
jennifer cooke of csis says he chose ghana to highlight america 's partnership with strong african countries .
" it 's a country , " she says , " that has now had five successive elections , which have been deemed free and fair ; so , it 's a chance to highlight a success in the perpetual focus on crises . "
as much as anything else , this trip represents the obama administration 's ongoing efforts to improve america 's image in the international community , using the chief executive 's personal approval ratings to make progress on important issues .

german bank ikb says it has obtained fresh german government guarantees worth seven billion euros to keep it liquid . the aid to the struggling bank has come from the german government 's banking rescue agency , soffin , but the european commission must still give regulatory clearance .
the help increases the total scope of government guarantees to ikb to 12 billion euros .
the dusseldorf-based bank said in a statement that its balance-sheet loss in the year to march 31 , 2009 amounted to 580 million euros .
that compares with an 11 million euro loss the previous year .
the bank , which was the first german casualty of the structured-finance debacle , lends to small industry .
the financial crisis in 2007 was the beginning of ikb 's slide , and last year the bank was sold to lone star , a us private-equity fund , for a knock-down price .
as a condition for state aid , ikb was required to shrink its business , which will mean a cut of one-fifth of its payroll. ch / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is good news - at least for peole in industrial countries .
but during a who swine flu summit , which wrapped up on friday in cancun , mexico , chan said that laboratories with capacity to produce the vaccine are mostly located in europe .
experts say this could have dire consequences for poor countries , especially those in the southern hemisphere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tourists have stayed away , but the who meeting has brought some trade to cancun .
90 % of projected stocks committed to rich countries jon kim andrus , an expert from the pan american health organization -lrb- paho -rrb- , said that 90 percent of the vaccine is already commited to high income countries , where some 893 million people live , and 10 percent to countries like china and russia , which can produce some of the vaccines themselves .
" if they began marketing the vaccine right now , developing countries would not get any , " andrus said at the cancun summit .
spain 's health minister , trinidad jimenez , called for the who , together with the european union , to reserve a portion of vaccine stock to be purchased for developing countries .
" we can not allow a massive reservation of stocks for purchase by a few countries , " said jimenez .
spain will not be able to build a laboratory capable of producing a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- vaccines until 2012 .
the who and paho are negotiating with vaccine producers to secure donations or sales at lower prices for developing countries .
richer nations are being asked to share some of their vaccine stocks .
the who director general chan said two companies had agreed to manufacture 250 million doses to be sent to developing countries , but she also acknowledged that the amount " is obviously not enough . "
chan said that while the first vaccines may be ready in august , recommendations for use may take awhile longer .
she urged rich countries not to hoarde future vaccine stocks .
chinese want to go it alone china wants to be self-sufficient in vaccine production , chinese health minister zhu chen said on the summit sidelines on friday , and plans to have a vaccine available by september .
the chinese minister said that some public companies in china are in the initial manufacturing process of a vaccine and that a preliminary version is likely to be ready by the end of this month .
bildunterschrift : the a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- virus failed to read this sign in hong kong .
the virus is currently being treated with influenza drug tamiflu .
however cases of infection resistant to the drug have been reported in hong kong , denmark and japan .
great britain the worst affected in europe britain has warned it could face more than 100,000 cases of swine flu a day by the end of august , if the current infection rate is maintained .
with nearly 7,500 cases of swine flu , the country has already been hit hardest in europe .
british health officials say they have abandoned attempts to stop the flu spreading , instead focusing on those who are most susceptible , such as the obese or those with asthma or other respiratory conditions .
three people have died in britain so far from the virus .
mexican health minister jose angel cordova called for " solidarity so that money is not the only factor in producer decisions about the distribution of the vaccine . "
mexico was the epicenter of the pandemic and remains the second worst-affected country after the united states .
to date , at least 337 people have died around the world from swine flu , which has infected 80,000 people in 121 countries. ch / reuters / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 04.07.2009 un secretary general snubbed by burma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ban made little headway with burmese leaders un secretary general ban ki-moon has said he was " deeply disappointed " that burma 's ruling military junta had denied his request to meet detained opposition leader , aung san suu kyi . ban said , with his mission to burma , he had hoped to rekindle a constructive dialogue with the country 's reclusive leaders .
when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the defect caused a sudden drop in voltage which , in turn , blacked out between 1,500 and 1,800 traffic lights in germany 's second-largest city of hamburg and darkened a number of shopping malls .
there were also power cuts last wednesday thought to have been caused by a transformer problem at the plant .
safety versus energy security kruemmel only re-opened less than two weeks ago after a two-year shutdown triggered by a fire .
the 2007 fire which was caused by a short circuit , and other incidents at vattenfall 's brunsbuettel power plant in the same year , fueled a fierce debate in germany about the safety of the country 's nuclear power stations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no radioactivity was released by the fire , but concerns remain the german government and four companies operating nuclear power plants in the country subsequently agreed to tighter safety standards .
when kruemmel re-opened in june , vattenfall said the plant , which generates about 10 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year , had been thoroughly modernized and that this would reduce the likelihood of a future incident .
in 2000 , germany decided to mothball its 17 reactors by the year 2020 .
however , chancellor angela merkel 's cdu / csu conservative bloc has for some time been calling for a re-assessment of that policy decision , arguing that germany 's dependence on foreign energy made nuclear power indispensable. gb / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when he first arrived in rangoon he seemed upbeat about his prospects , saying that " first and foremost , " he was going " to argue for the release of all political prisoners , including aung san suu kyi . "
" i will ask for the early resumption of the political dialogue between the government and aung san suu kyi , " he said .
but then , the burmese junta made ban ki-moon wait overnight for its reply to his request to visit imprisoned suu kyi in rangoon .
when it finally got around to telling ban on saturday , it snubbed the un secretary-general , rejecting his wish .
ban , instead , was given a meager 30-minute meeting with the regime 's 76-year-old leader .
burma 's top general , than shwe , told ban that suu kyi was on trial and that the regime did not want to interfere with the judicial process .
critics have dismissed her hearing as a show trial aimed at keeping her out of multi-party elections next year .
ban told reporters afterward that he felt the refusal was a mistake .
the junta initiated proceedings against the nobel laureate suu kyi , claiming she had breached the conditions of her house arrest when an american man swam a lake to make an uninvited visit in her home .
if found guilty , suu kyi could be jailed for up to five years .
critics say the trial aims to silence the charismatic leader of the national league for democracy until after elections , due to be held in 2010 .
the eu has imposed sanctions against burma and brussels has long called on burmese authorities to release suu kyi , maintaining a lengthy list of sanctions on regime figures and companies linked to the military junta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suu kyi is the most popular opposition figure in burma ban calls for transparent elections " i am deeply disappointed .
i think they have missed a very important opportunity to demonstrate their willingness to commit to continuing reconciliation , " he said .
after his meeting with than shwe , ban gave a rare public speech in rangoon outlining his vision for a democratic burma .
he told an audience of diplomats , un agencies and non-governmental organizations that the military regime must free aung san suu kyi and introduce key reforms for the good of the country .
he said that the upcoming election , promised for 2010 and the first to be held in 20 years , " must be inclusive , participatory and transparent , if it is to be credible . "
ban told the group that " neither peace nor development can thrive without democracy and respect for human rights … -lrb- and -rrb- the primary responsibility rests with the government . "
the secretary-general emphasized that burma was one of the signatories of the un declaration of human rights , but added that " unfortunately , that commitment has not been matched in deed . "
burma 's human right record , he said , remained " a matter of grave concern . " gb / epd / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german bank ikb says it has obtained fresh german government guarantees worth seven billion euros to keep it liquid . the aid to the struggling bank has come from the german government 's banking rescue agency , soffin , but the european commission must still give regulatory clearance .
the help increases the total scope of government guarantees to ikb to 12 billion euros .
the dusseldorf-based bank said in a statement that its balance-sheet loss in the year to march 31 , 2009 amounted to 580 million euros .
that compares with an 11 million euro loss the previous year .
the bank , which was the first german casualty of the structured-finance debacle , lends to small industry .
the financial crisis in 2007 was the beginning of ikb 's slide , and last year the bank was sold to lone star , a us private-equity fund , for a knock-down price .
as a condition for state aid , ikb was required to shrink its business , which will mean a cut of one-fifth of its payroll. ch / dpa / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a debate that cast the icc in the role of a toothless stooge of ex-colonial powers , the au leaders voted not to cooperate in the arrest and transfer of sudan 's president to the icc .
they argued that the indictment and arrest warrant for war crimes committed during fighting in sudan 's darfur region could compromise peace efforts in darfur .
several countries were not happy with the final document .
former south african president thabo mbeki is chairing an au panel responsible for bringing peace to darfur by making recommendations to the au 's peace and security council , as an alternative to the icc indictment .

according to international experts , 200,000 people have died and more than 2.5 million have been driven from their homes in the country 's remote western region since mostly non-arab rebels took up arms against the government in 2003 .
khartoum puts the death toll at just 10,000 .
prior to the decision , new york-based campaign group human rights watch said that if the au approved the draft resolution , the 30 african states who have signed up to the icc would be violating their legal obligations .
meanwhile , it became known that armed men have seized two female aid workers , one irish and one ugandan , in sudan 's darfur region .
it is the third kidnapping of foreign aid workers in the territory in the past four months. ch / reuters / ap / afp editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
